"1","1905","Bertha von Suttner","   On behalf of the Nobel Committee, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson introduced the speaker, Baroness Bertha von Suttner, to the audience. In a few words he recalled the great influence of the Baroness on the growth of the peace movement. While still young she had had the audacity to oppose the horrors of war1, and had done so in one of the most militaristic countries in Europe. She had continued this fight all her life and never wearied of crying “Down with Arms“2. Despite the laughter with which her words had been greeted in the beginning, they did receive a hearing because they were uttered by a person of noble character and because they proclaimed humanity’s greatest cause. Many women had since followed in her footsteps and taken up the cause, and the call to lay down arms had become general. Moreover, to all men of goodwill the cause of peace and the women’s cause were one and the same movement, striving for the same goal. When the cause of peace prevailed, then too would the women’s cause be won. * * * History constantly demonstrates the great influence of women. Women have encouraged the ideas of war, the attitude to life, and the causes for which men have fought, for which their sons were brought up, and of which they have dreamed. Any change or reformation of these ideas must be brought about chiefly by women. The human ideal of manly courage and manly deeds must become more enlightened; the faithful worker in all spiritual and material spheres of life must displace the bloodstained hero as the true ideal. Women will cooperate to give men higher aims, to give their sons nobler dreams. Many are the individual women who have set an example in sacrifice and work, who have followed the armies as angels of consolation and healing, tending the sick and suffering. How much more effective it is to do one’s utmost to prevent misfortune! This is where you, Madame Baroness, have taken the lead among women of today. You have attacked war itself and cried to the nations: “Down with arms!” This call will be your eternal honor. Beginning as a murmur in the corn on a summer’s day
And growing to a gale through the tops of the forest,
Till the ocean bears it on with tenderous voice,
And nothing is heard but this.1 These stirring words of our great poet apply to your call to action, Madame Baroness. It began as a murmur through the lovely meadow of the Danube Valley2 , that old highway for the devastating armies of war. We already hear it in the forests in all parts of the world and soon, we hope, its voice, borne by the oceans of people, will permanently drown the sound of war drums and trumpets. This will take a long time, some will say. We do not know. And it makes no difference to our work. Our task is clear: to combat any act of violence, any war of aggression, and so render even the justifiable defensive war unnecessary. We shall rouse the conscience of man, put justice and morality in the place of war. We thank you, Madame Baroness, for your firm faith, for your hope and self-sacrifice, for your work. We too, in the lands of the North, women as well as men, need you to light and nourish the flame of faith and work. Good luck to you! Frédèric Passy, that venerable apostle of peace3 has called you, Madame Baroness, our general-in-chief. The friends of peace in Scandinavia applaud this salute."
"2","1906","Theodore Roosevelt"," As the Nobel   Committee meets today, the tenth of December, perhaps for the   last time in this hall1, to   announce to the Norwegian Parliament its decision concerning the   award of the Peace Prize, it is appropriate to recall that the   Norwegian Parliament was one of the first national assemblies to   adopt and to support the cause of peace. Twelve or fifteen years   ago, Gentlemen, the cause of peace presented a very different   aspect from the one it presents today. The cause was then   regarded as a utopian idea and its advocates as well-meaning but   overly enthusiastic idealists who had no place in practical   politics, being out of touch with the realities of life. The   situation has altered radically since then, for in recent years   leading statesmen, even heads of state, have espoused the cause,   which has now acquired a totally different image in public   opinion. The United States of America was among the first to   infuse the ideal of peace into practical politics. Peace and   arbitration treaties have now been concluded between the United   States and the governments of several countries. But what has   especially directed the attention of the friends of peace and of   the whole civilized world to the United States is President   Roosevelt’s happy role in bringing to an end the bloody war   recently waged between two of the world’s great powers, Japan and   Russia2. On behalf of the   Norwegian Parliament, I now present to you, Mr. Ambassador, the   Peace Prize along with its insignia, and I add the request that   you convey to the President the greetings of the Norwegian people   and their gratitude for all that he has done in the cause of   peace. I would also add the wish that this eminent and highly   gifted man may be blessed with the opportunity of continuing his   work to strengthen the ideal of peace and to secure the peace of   the world.    1. The hall in which the Norwegian   Parliament customarily met. Mr. Knudsen anticipates, no doubt,   that future sessions for this purpose would be held in the   Norwegian Nobel Institute, which had recently been   constructed.    2. Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905).   The laureate offered his good offices to mediate the dispute; the   result was the Treaty of Portsmouth signed by Russia and Japan on   September 5, 1905, at Portsmouth, N.H., U.S.A."
"3","1907","Ernesto Teodoro Moneta, Louis Renault"," Ernesto Teodoro Moneta was born in Milan in   1833. At the age of fifteen he took part in the war of liberation   against the Austrians, and in 1859 he fought at Garibaldi’s side   in both North and South Italy. In 1866 Moneta was an officer in   the war with Austria, but after that campaign he retired from the   army and has since devoted himself to journalism. In his thirties   he became editor-in-chief of the Milan newspaper Il   Secolo, one of the most important newspapers in Italy, and   since 1898 he has published the periodical La Vita   internazionale.    Since 1870 Moneta has belonged to the international peace   movement and is its most important Italian representative. He has   been a member of the Commission of the International Peace Bureau since 1895.   With his prominent position in the Italian press, he has enjoyed   excellent opportunities to promote his views. Special emphasis   must be placed on his work in the press and in peace meetings,   both public and private, for an understanding between France and   Italy – work which dates back as far as the beginning of the   modern-day enmity between these two countries.    In 1887 Moneta founded the Lombard Peace Union, of which he is   now president. He has organized several peace meetings in Italy   and in 1906 presided over the fifteenth International Peace   Congress in Milan.    
        From Nobel Lectures, Peace 1901-1925, Editor Frederick W. Haberman, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1972
 Louis Renault was born in 1843 at Autun   (Saône-et-Loire) and since the age of twenty-five has been   professor of international law, first at Dijon and then in 1873   in Paris, where he has lectured both at the Faculty of Law at the   University and at the Free School of Exact Sciences, which trains   aspiring diplomats and members of the consular service. Since   1890 Renault has also been legal counselor to the French Ministry   of Foreign Affairs.    Although Renault has not been a prolific writer, he is the author   of a number of articles on international law, some published as   monographs, some in periodicals; and in collaboration with a   colleague he has produced a treatise on commercial law which is   very highly regarded. His principal activities have been those of   university lecturer – he may be said to have been the guiding   genius in the teaching of international law in France – of   counselor to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and finally   of France’s representative at a large number of international   meetings, among them: the conferences in Bern and Paris on the   protection of literary and artistic property1; the important series of conferences at   The Hague in 1893, 1894, 1900, and 1904 on agreements about   international civil legal conditions; the conference in Geneva in   1906 for the revision of the 1864 Geneva Convention2; and last, but not least, the two   international Peace Conferences at The Hague in 1899 and   1907.    At all these conferences Louis Renault has played an outstanding   part. As a rule he has been the rapporteur of the meeting   and as such has drafted reports and recommendations;   consequently, he has had a decisive influence upon the agreements   and the form they took. At the Hague Peace Conference in 1899,   Renault was reporter for the commission working on the problem of   applying the provisions of the Geneva Convention to naval   warfare, and for the drafting committee which drew up the Final   Act of the Conference.    Renault’s participation in the Peace Conference at The   Hague3 was even more important.   He was spokesman on the following problems:      (1) Opening of hostilities     (2) Application of the Geneva Convention to naval warfare     (3) Obligations and rights of neutral countries in the case of     naval warfare     (4) The International Prize Court of Appeal.    The last two, in particular, are of   far-reaching importance, as well as of extremely delicate nature.   Renault was also chairman and spokesman of the drafting committee   of the Conference and, as such, had enormous influence upon the   final wording of the Conventions; by the outstanding part he   played in the debates, probably greater than that of any other   member, he also made his mark on the work of the Conference as a   whole.    The president of the Conference, Mr. Nelidov4, described Renault as its   «principal worker» and on one occasion said that his   dictionary had run out of words of praise with which to describe   Renault’s share in the work of the Conference.    Louis Renault is a member of the Institute of International Law   and of the Institut de France.    1. Bern: 1886; Paris: 1896    2. The first Geneva Convention for   the Amelioration of the Condition of Soldiers wounded in Armed   Forces in the Field (signed on August 22, 1864) was revised at   this 1906 conference which was called by the Swiss in response to   a request made at the time of the 1899 Hague Peace   Conference.    3. In 1907    4. Aleksandr Nelidov (1838-1910),   Russian diplomat, president of the 1907 Hague Peace   Conference."
"4","1908","Klas Pontus Arnoldson, Fredrik Bajer"," On behalf of the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament, I have the honor to extend a welcome to all who have assembled here on this occasion commemorating the great Swedish patron and benefactor, Alfred Nobel, who gave the whole of his large fortune to the solution of problems concerning the future fate of mankind. Since we last met here, one of the winners of the Peace Prize, Randal Cremer, has left us forever1; but he has left behind the memory of a great personality and of a warm friend of peace and of mankind. I invite you all to honor his memory by standing. This year the Nobel Committee has unanimously decided to divide the Peace Prize between former member of the Swedish Parliament, K.P. Arnoldson, and former member of the Danish Parliament, Fredrik Bajer. It is a great pleasure for the Committee to award the prize to these gentlemen, since it is convinced that its choice accords with the general desire in the Scandinavian countries. They have both been untiring advocates of the ideals of peace. K.P. Arnoldson was born in Gothenburg in 1844 and in his youth was in the service of the Swedish Railways. At the same time, however, he also worked for the press as a journalist and author, one of his favorite subjects even then being the cause of peace. From 1882 to 1887 Arnoldson was a member of the Lower House of the Swedish Parliament; In 1883 he put forward a proposal for an address to the king, petitioning for a declaration of permanent neutrality by Sweden. The proposal was not adopted, but the House recommended that the government should continue to work along the lines of the proposal. In the same year Arnoldson helped to found the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Association [Svenska freds-och skiljedomsföreningen], which recently celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. Arnoldson was secretary of the association for the first few years and edited its paper. Arnoldson’s work also extended to Norway. The success of his speeches in several of our cities in 1889 and 1890 indirectly encouraged Parliament in 1890 to adopt his arbitration address to the king. Arnoldson has published a number of important works on peace, several of which have been translated into other languages. His most important is The Hope of the Centuries: A Book on World Peace, an account of the growth of the idea of peace among nations and in international relations. Mr. Arnoldson, along with Mr. Fredrik Bajer, was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize this year with the unanimous support of the Swedish Interparliamentary Group and a number of Norwegian members of Parliament.      *  *  * Fredrik Bajer was born in 1837. Like Tolstoy and many other fighters for peace, he began his career as an officer and from 1856 to 1865 was a lieutenant of Dragoons. He then began his study of foreign languages, becoming an elementary school teacher and later a translator. Already in the 1860’s he was maintaining contact with the peace movement and was in touch with Frédéric Passy, who in 1867 founded the first French peace society1. From 1872 to 1895, Bajer was a member of Parliament for Horsens and during that time did much work for the cause of peace and for women’s rights. Mr. Bajer has been an extraordinarily prolific writer, and in his many articles and pamphlets about and in favor of the cause of peace, he has dealt with practically all the problems involved in the peace movement. Norwegian newspapers have also enjoyed the benefit of his able pen. Special mention should be made of his great study of the question of neutrality. In 1882 he was also responsible for the foundation of a peace society in Denmark, at first called the Society for the Promotion of Danish Neutrality and later the Danish Peace Society2. At a very early date Mr. Bajer took an active part in the European peace movement. In 1884 he participated in the International Congress in Bern and in 1889 he took part both in the International Congress and in the Interparliamentary Conference, held during the Great Exhibition in Paris; since then there have been few of these meetings in which he has not participated. It was at his instigation and suggestion that in 1891 a permanent International Peace Bureau was established in Bern. Bajer was president of its Board of Administration until last year when he declined reelection and was instead named honorary president. Since 1891 Bajer has also had a seat on the council which controls the Interparliamentary Union. He has always shown a great interest in cooperation between the Nordic countries in the cause of peace. He has invariably taken part in the Nordic peace meetings, and it is mainly due to his efforts that a Nordic Interparliamentary Union has been founded3. Fredrik Bajer was nominated this year as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize by the Danish Interparliamentary Group, among others, and, together with K.P. Arnoldson, by the Swedish Interparliamentary Group and a number of members of the Norwegian Parliament.   "
"5","1909","Auguste Beernaert, Paul Henri d'Estournelles de Constant"," Auguste Beernaert was born in 18281. After completing his legal studies he   began practice as a barrister in Brussels in 1853. In 1859 he was   appointed counsel at the Belgian Supreme Court of Appeal. He   entered politics at an early date and in 18732 was elected deputy for Thielt. His   unusual talents and political ability promised a great political   future. In 18753 he was named   minister of public works, an office he held until 1878 when the   Liberal Party won the election. When his Clerical Party returned   to power in 1884, he was made head of the Department of   Agriculture, Industry, and Public Works, and a few months later   became finance minister and head of the cabinet. In 1895 he was   elected president of the Chamber of Representatives.    Beernaert has played a leading role in Belgian politics. It was   through his efforts that the Belgian Chamber agreed that King   Leopold4 should become sovereign   of the Congo State, and it was thanks to him that fortifications   were constructed on the Meuse to protect Belgium’s neutrality.   This experienced politician also played an important part in the   revision of the Belgian constitution. His work for the cause of   peace is widely known in Europe, and his name renowned in the   International Peace Conferences. At the first Hague Conference he   was chairman of the commission set up to formulate proposals for   the restriction of armaments.    Beernaert is also a member of the Permanent Arbitration   Commission, a member of the Institut de France and of the Belgian   Academy. He is honorary president of the Société de   droit international, active president of the Association for the   Promotion of International Maritime Law, and honorary president   of the International Law Association.    Each of these men [Mr. Beernaert and Baron d’Estournelles de   Constant] holds a prominent position in the international   movement for peace and arbitration, and it is therefore fully in   keeping with the spirit of Nobel’s intentions that the prize   should be awarded to them.    1. According to all sources   checked, Beernaert was born in 1829.    2. According to all sources   checked: 1874.    3. According to all sources   checked: 1873.    4. Leopold II (1835-1909), King of   Belgium (1865-1909). See biography   of Beernaert.         * * *       Paul Henri Benjamin d’Estournelles de   Constant is still in the prime of life. Born on September 22,   18521, at La Flèche (Sarthe),   he belongs to the old French aristocracy. As Baron de Constant de   Rebecque, he can trace his ancestry back to the Crusaders.    He was educated at the Lycée Louis le Grand in Paris and   later studied law; he is a Licentiate of Law and also holds a   diploma from the School of Oriental Languages.    At the age of twenty-three he became attaché in the French   Foreign Office and two years later was sent to the Balkans. When   he was twenty-nine he became secretary-general of the French   Residency in Tunis; on the basis of his experience there he wrote   La Politique française en Tunisie2. While in Tunis, d’Estournelles de   Constant performed most valuable organizing work.    He returned to Paris and became assistant director for the Levant   in the Department of Foreign Affairs. At thirty-eight he went to   London as counselor to the Embassy, with the title of minister   plenipotentiary. As chargé d’affaires he was involved in   averting threatened war between France and England during the   conflict between King Chulalongkorn of Siam and the French   fleet3.    Since then he has become thoroughly dedicated to the movement for   peace and arbitration, and he has written a number of books and   articles on the subject.    He entered politics in his own country, and in 1895 the   republican Baron stood for his native Sarthe. He was elected   senator in 1904.    In 1899 d’Estournelles de Constant was named a French   representative at the first Hague Conference, and in 1903 he   founded the Groupe parlementaire de l’arbitrage international. It   was this work which determined his later political attitude. A   practical result of his efforts was the arbitration treaties   between France and other countries, and he saw his policy adopted   beyond the frontiers of France. He believed that foreign policy   should be controlled by parliaments and that consequently   parliamentary arbitration groups should be developed and   strengthened.    His work for peace has not been performed blindly. As a diplomat   he has learned to understand international policy and has planned   his efforts accordingly.    In this country d’Estournelles de Constant is a well-known and   very welcome visitor ever since the last visit of the French   parliamentarians4.    1. According to all sources checked,   d’Estournelles was born on November 22, 1852.    2. Published in 1891, the book won a   prize from the French Academy.    3. In 1893 during French-Siamese   border disputes, the Siamese, under Chulalongkorn (Rama V,   1868-1910), fired at gunboats sent to enforce French demands. A   French ultimatum, rejected by the Siamese, was followed by a   blockade which, in turn, brought opposition from the British who   refused to remove a gunboat stationed at Bangkok to protect   British subjects. The crisis, brief but acute, ended when the   Siamese were obliged to accept the ultimatum and the blockade was   raised.    4. The laureate was an advocate and   organizer of reciprocal visits between parliamentary groups of   the various nations; his own group had just visited Norway in the   preceding summer."
"6","1910","Permanent International Peace Bureau"," Chairman of the Committee Løvland then   announced that the Peace Prize for this year had been awarded to   the permanent Peace Bureau in Bern.    He then briefly reviewed the peace movement in Europe which, as   we all know, has made steady headway since the great Napoleonic   Wars. The idea had earlier been championed by men like   Kant1 and Rousseau2. First attempts were made to form   organizations in America and in England. The cause was supported   by Garibaldi3 and his   comrades-in-arms and by the writer Victor Hugo4.    The Permanent International Peace Bureau (Bureau international   permanent de la paix) was founded in 1891, with its headquarters   in Bern. It was clear from the annual peace congresses that a   central office was needed to act as a link between the peace   societies of the various countries, and in particular to help the   local congress committees to organize the world rallies. To make   the Bureau a legally constituted body empowered to receive   donations and legacies, it was made the agency of a society   (Société du Bureau international permanent de la paix)   in accordance with Swiss law. Admission to membership is open to   any institution, association, or individual upon a simple   declaration of agreement with the objectives of the   society.    The Bureau is now under the control of a Commission of   thirty-five members from the various countries under a president,   at the present time Belgian Senator Henri La Fontaine. Three members must   live in Bern where the offices of the Bureau are situated and   supervised by an honorary secretary-general. Nobel Prizewinner   Élie Ducommun held this   office from the time of the Bureau’s founding until his death in   1906, a period during which he rendered most valuable services to   the organization.    The present secretary-general is Nobel Prizewinner Dr. Gobat, member of the [Swiss] Federal   Council. Both men have worked without compensation.    The economic position of the Peace Bureau has been difficult. In   addition to the interest on a capital of about 40,000 francs, it   has for some years received smaller fixed annual grants from   Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. With some private   contributions, it has about 8,000 francs per annum. Most of this   is spent on the publication of the journal Correspondance   bimensuelle, which gives news of the peace movement and lists   new literature on the subject of peace. The Bureau issues a   yearbook, Annuaire du mouvement pacifiste, with valuable   information and papers on international affairs, institutions,   and personalities. Since 1894 the Bureau has had an affiliated   American office in Washington.    It is the function of the Bern Bureau to facilitate   communications between the societies and individuals, and to   collect information on the peace movement; it has a record office   and a library; it also prepares the questions to be put before   the annual world peace congresses and implements the decisions of   the congresses.    It has long been the common wish of all those in the peace   movement throughout the world that the Bureau be awarded the   Peace Prize. The World Peace Congress in Munich in 1908 directed   a general request to all those entitled to make nominations, to   name the Bureau.    The Nobel Committee has also received recommendations from, among   others, the Swedish and Danish Peace Unions.    We are convinced that this award is entirely in the spirit of   Alfred Nobel’s plan; he wanted his money to be used to support,   accelerate, and promote the peace movement.    We firmly hope and expect that this year’s prize will further   this aim and that the fruits of the award will be harvested in   the years to come.    The Nobel lecture usually delivered by the prizewinner was not   given in this case.    1. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804),   German philosopher; wrote On Perpetual Peace (1795).    2. Jean Jacques Rousseau   (1712-1778), French philosopher; wrote The Social Contract   (1762), outlining the political principles of a governmental   utopia.    3. Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882),   Italian patriot and soldier; supported, mostly by personal   correspondence and letters to the press, an International Court   of Justice, a United States of Europe, free education, and other   plans to promote international understanding.    4. Victor Hugo (1802-1885), French   author; was associated with peace movements in the mid-19th   century – for example, he chaired the Peace Congress held in   Paris in 1849 and in his welcoming speech made his famous   allusion to the «United States of Europe»."
"7","1911","Tobias Asser, Alfred Fried"," Tobias Michael Carel Asser was born in 1838 in Amsterdam where he became professor of commercial law and later of international law from 1862 to 1893 when he was named a member of the Council of State. He soon became legal counselor to the Dutch Foreign Office and in 1904 minister of state. He holds honorary doctorates from the Universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Bologna. He was a Dutch delegate at the two Peace Conferences at The Hague1 and, among other things, arbitrator in the dispute between Russia and the U.S.A. on the Bering Straits, which he heard in 19022, and in the dispute between the U.S.A. and Mexico on the Pious Fund of the Californias, which was brought to the Arbitration Court at The Hague (1902)3. He was one of the founders of the Institut de droit international (1873)4 and has been one of its most active and influential members. Asser has above all been a practical legal statesman. He holds a position in the sphere of international private law similar to that enjoyed by the famous French jurist Louis Renault5 in international public law. Indeed, his public activity has overshadowed his scholarly writing, which is of great importance in its own right. As a pioneer in the field of international legal relations, he has earned a reputation as one of the leaders in modem jurisprudence. It is therefore only natural that his countrymen should see him as a successor to or reviver of The Netherlands’ pioneer work in international law in the seventeenth century6. It was at his instigation that the Dutch government summoned the four. conferences at The Hague in 1893, 1894, 1900, and 1904 on international private law; all presided over by Asser, they prepared the ground for conventions which would establish uniformity in international private law and thus lead to greater public security and justice in international relations. The responsibility then passed to individual countries to bring their national legislation into line. Asser has also proposed that other nations follow The Netherlands’ example by appointing permanent commissions to prepare the work of the Conferences. «By doing this», he said in 1900, «the foundations will be laid for an international organization which, without interfering with the complete autonomy of the nations in the domain of legislation, would contribute greatly to the codification of international civil law within the not too distant future.» As a result of these conferences, seven Conventions have been concluded on different aspects of civil procedure (legal aid) and of family law; five of these have been subscribed to by Norway.    * * * Alfred Hermann Fried was born in Vienna in   1864, but most of his activities have been carried on in Germany.   Since 1891 he has devoted his whole life to work for peace, one   of the few men to do so. Fried, who was first a bookseller and   then a journalist, is a self-educated man who, with true German   persistence and application, worked his way up until he had   mastered scholarly writing. He has probably been the most   industrious literary pacifist in the past twenty years. In 1892   he founded the Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft [German Peace   Society] and for a time edited its journals. Since 1899 he has   been publishing his own monthly periodical Die   Friederswarte1, which he has   gradually turned into the best journal in the peace movement,   with excellent leading articles and news of topical international   problems. Fried has considered it his task to win over the German   university faculties of international law and history to the   cause of peace and to persuade them to contribute to his   periodical, and he may now be said to have succeeded. Among the   many who have lent their support to Fried’s candidacy for the   Nobel Peace Prize are Professors L. von Bar, Lamprecht, Niemeyer,   Schucking, Rehm, and Lentner2.   Fried’s name was also proposed by the Swedish Parliamentary Peace   Group through Baron Bonde and by the Swedish Peace and   Arbitration Association through another member of   Parliament.    According to Fried, the foundation of the peace movement should   be the legal and political organization of international   life. He finds the beginnings of an efficient organization in the   existing international bureaus and wants new ones to be created   for all fields of international relations. The existing   international anarchy (armed peace) will gradually disappear with   increased organization and be succeeded by an ordered state of   peace. Because of this viewpoint Fried places less emphasis on   combating war; the method generally employed by friends of peace,   that of arousing disgust at the idea of war, is not in his   opinion sufficient. Instead of fighting the symptoms of war, he   wants first and foremost to fight its cause, namely, the anarchy   in international relations. Fried has argued his theory in a work   entitled The Basis of Pacifism3 (Freiburg, 1908).    In addition to innumerable contributions to the Austro-German   press, Fried has published a large number of individual   monographs and books on pacifism. Among these are: Das   Abrüstungs-Problem (Berlin, 1904); Der kranke   Krieg (Leipzig, 1909), a collection of his best leading   articles in Die Friedenswarte; and Pan-Amerika   (Berlin, 1910), a meritorious scholarly account of the efforts   organized by the Pan-American Bureau4 in Washington. His best known work is   his Handbuch der Friedensbewegung (1905) of which Part I   came out this year in a new and expanded edition. It is an   account of the fundamental problems of the peace movement, giving   reports on peace conferences and the position of arbitration, and   containing an interesting historical review of the peace   movement, with biographies of outstanding friends of peace and a   list of societies and other organizations belonging to the   movement.    Fried’s agitation played a part in bringing about the Morocco   Pact5.         1. This replaced Die Waffen   Nieder, published by Fried and edited by Bertha von Suttner.    2. All of these were scholars and   experts in law (particularly international law) or in history and   political science.    3.

"8","1912","Elihu Root"," Elihu Root was born on February 15, 1845,   in the State of New York and took his degree in law at New York University in   1867. At a later date he studied international law and took his   doctorate1 in 1894. For some   years he practiced as an attorney in New York, becoming one of   the best in the profession. In August, 1899, he was appointed   secretary of war by President McKinley and held that office until 1904.   In the following year Roosevelt   persuaded him to take over the State Department where he remained   until his election to the Senate in 1909.    Root is a man of engaging personality who has tried, with   determination and independence, to put his ideals into   practice.    In the ten years during which he held office [as secretary of war   and secretary of state], he had to settle a number of   particularly difficult problems, some of an international   character. It was he who was chiefly responsible for organizing   affairs in Cuba and in the Philippines after the Spanish-American   War2. Even more important was his   work in bringing about better understanding between the countries   of North and South America. When he visited South America in the   summer of 1906, he did a great deal to strengthen the   Pan-American movement, and in 1908 he founded the Pan-American   Bureau in New York3. His   strenuous efforts to improve relations between the small Central   American countries have borne splendid fruit. The most difficult   problem with which Root had to deal while secretary of state,   however, was the dispute with Japan over the status of Japanese   immigrants. Although a final solution of this dispute eluded him,   his work4 on it was nevertheless   of great value.    After he had left the government, Root gave himself heart and   soul to the cause of peace, and he is now president of the great   Carnegie Peace   Foundation5. [As a senator]   Root was one of the most energetic champions of Taft’s proposal for an unconditional arbitration   treaty between the U.S.A. and Great Britain; and in the dispute   concerning tolls for the Panama Canal, he supported the English   interpretation of the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, opposing special   privileges for American shipping6. When he spoke on this in the Senate   last spring, he gained the admiration of all friends of   peace.    1.

"9","1913","Henri La Fontaine"," Henri La Fontaine is the true leader of the   popular peace movement in Europe. Since 1907 he has been   president of the International Peace   Bureau in Bern. He is also a prominent member of the Interparliamentary   Union1. La Fontaine was born   on April 22, 1854, in Brussels, where he is counsel at the Court   of Appeal and a professor of international law. He entered the   Senate in 1895 and has been working for the cause of peace since   1889. La Fontaine is also a member of the Brussels City Council,   a member sponsored by the Socialist Party. He is one of the best   informed men working for peace, and his initiative and energy   have done much to promote the international peace movement,   particularly in the interparliamentary and peace conferences of   recent years, where he has contributed to the practical   organization of the movement and to the framing of international   law. In 1899, for example, his activities included participation   in a Peace Congress in Oslo. In 1895 he founded the International   Institute of Bibliography and [later] the Central   Office of International Associations2. La Fontaine has also been very active   in the literary field, an example being his great documentary   work on arbitration cases from 1794 to 19003. There is no one who has contributed   more to the organization of peaceful internationalism, and his   outstanding talent for administration has been invaluable to the   peace movement. La Fontaine belongs to the moderate wing of the   Socialist Party; he is the first Social Democrat to receive the   Nobel Peace Prize.    The laureate did not deliver a Nobel lecture.    1. In effect founded in 1888 but   formally constituted in 1889, the Union is composed of   parliamentarians from the various nations who discuss problems of   international relations and law, and of peace, promoting their   solution through governmental channels; at this time it was   primarily interested in encouraging arbitration of international   disputes.    2. The creation of both the   Institute in 1895 and the Central Office twelve years later must   be credited to the initiative of two Belgian internationalists:   La Fontaine and his friend Paul Otlet.    3.

"10","1922","Fridtjof Nansen"," I take pleasure in announcing that this   year’s Peace Prize has been awarded to Professor Fridtjof   Nansen.    Work of an international character carried out by Mr. Nansen   during these past years has brought him the Peace Prize. I might   especially mention his work in the repatriation of prisoners of   war, his work for the Russian refugees, his work in aiding the   millions in Russia struggling against famine, and now his work   for the refugees in Asia Minor and Thrace. Although this activity   has been in progress for only a few years, its extent and   significance are such that the Nobel Committee has felt it worthy   of the great distinction of the Nobel Peace Prize.    Those of us who have remained at home, following events only   through the newspapers, have had but isolated glimpses of all   this. We have seen how great international tasks have again and   again been entrusted to Nansen. We have seen him appear as the   High Commissioner of the League of Nations1, its representative and   plenipotentiary. We have seen him negotiating with   representatives of nearly every country in Europe or with   agencies created under his administration. We see him incessantly   on the move: one day we read in a cable that he is having talks   with Lloyd George2 in London;   then we suddenly learn that he has gone to Rome for a conference   with the Pope. Next he is in Russia to study the famine at first   hand and to negotiate with the Soviet government; typhus claims   some of his closest collaborators, but he himself, as so often   before, emerges safe and sound from the danger. Another day he is   to be found in the League of Nations Assembly in Geneva, pleading   the cause of humanity in the face of all political prejudices.   Then he is off once more on his travels, most recently to   Constantinople and Greece, until he now stands for a moment among   us, in his homeland, to receive the Peace Prize awarded to him   without his even having been aware of his candidacy.    Nansen’s reports to the League of Nations and the records of its   debates provide an authentic and comprehensive account of his   activities during these years3. I   shall try, with the aid of this material, to give an outline of   the principal facts.    In April, 1920, the League of Nations charged Professor Nansen   with the direction of the repatriation of the prisoners of war   who had not yet been exchanged. He was authorized to negotiate   with the various governments and to cooperate with the   organizations which had already begun this work.    There were then about half a million people languishing in Europe   and Asia, still waiting to return to their homes. The greater   part of them had been made prisoners during the gigantic struggle   between Russia and Germany in the early years of the war. So they   had been waiting for four, five, and even six years. Most of them   had suffered exceedingly, both physically and mentally. Homeless,   starved, tortured, unwanted where they were, they longed to   return to the homes from which they had been torn and where they   were now anxiously awaited.    As representative of the League of Nations, Nansen immediately   approached the Soviet and German governments, as well as those of   a number of other states, and concluded agreements for the   delivery of the prisoners and for their board and transport.   Relying particularly on using the Baltic route, he succeeded,   after considerable difficulty, in chartering some of the ships   which Germany was to deliver to England under the terms of the   peace treaty4. These were used   for the repatriation of the prisoners which now proceeded quickly   and at unexpectedly low cost. Some of the prisoners, those from   Eastern Siberia, had to be sent home via Vladivostok, others   through the Black Sea, thus creating more serious problems as   well as entailing more time.    The greatest difficulty, however, was in raising the required   funds, for it was necessary to arrange governmental loans to a   number of the Central European states whose prisoners were to be   returned. This took some time but was successfully accomplished   in the end.    In September, 1921, Nansen was able to report to the League of   Nations that it had been possible to repatriate 350,000 prisoners   via the Baltic, 12,000 via Vladivostok, and 5,000 via the Black   Sea. His task was practically finished.    But even before it could be concluded, Nansen was given another   and still more difficult one.    Russian refugees had settled all over Europe, their number being   estimated at one and a half million. Some of them had managed to   obtain work and put down roots where they were. But many were   without work or resources and consequently were a burden to the   countries in which they lived.    In June, 1921, the Council of the League of Nations decided to   appoint a High Commissioner whose assignment would be to promote   mutual cooperation between nations, with a view to transferring   unemployed and needy prisoners to countries where work was   available. In August, 1921, Nansen took over this post of High   Commissioner.    His first job was to obtain a clear picture of this multitude of   scattered and homeless human beings and to consider what future   possibilities could be opened up for them. Having done this, he   had to negotiate with countries which might be willing to accept   Russian refugees and provide them with work and opportunity.   Obviously, it was here that the greatest difficulties would be   encountered.    Nansen started negotiations with a number of governments, and   also appointed representatives who could negotiate on his behalf.   As had to be expected, a number of states refused to accept any   refugees. But many others responded favorably. Moreover, a large   number of refugees originally from countries which were separated   from Russia after the war – for example, many Estonians – were   taken back home.    This work has already achieved a large measure of success. It has   been hampered and delayed, however, by the inadequacy of the   funds available. In one of his reports to the Council of the   League of Nations, Nansen says that the whole problem could have   been solved much more quickly if he had had at his disposal only   a fraction of the huge sums which the governments paid out during   a single year to support the Russian refugees.    With this work still in progress, Nansen received his third and   most formidable mission.    The famine in Russia had assumed enormous proportions and   threatened to ravage vast areas. The lives of twenty to thirty   million people were at stake.    In August, 1921, Nansen was asked to direct the famine relief   work. This time the request came not from the League of Nations   but from a conference of governments and private organizations   held in Geneva5.    From one point of view, Nansen’s task was not so difficult; for   although millions in Russia were starving and approaching certain   ruin unless they were given aid, there were huge quantities of   grain in other countries. In the United States, for example, the   wheat lay rotting for lack of buyers, and in Argentina there was   such an abundance of maize that it was used as fuel for railway   engines. Nor did the shipment of the grain to Russia present a   great problem, since whole fleets of ships were lying idle.   Moreover, the transport network inside Russia itself was adequate   for the distribution of the grain, especially if it arrived   before winter closed rivers and lakes.    There was, however, another and greater difficulty to be faced.   In a world where nations, social classes, and individuals fought   each other to further their own ideas and ambitions, there had to   be created a feeling of solidarity strong enough to transcend   national frontiers and political differences.    Nansen immediately approached the Soviet government and concluded   an agreement on two points: first, that the grain sent would   reach those for whom it was intended and, second, that Nansen   would be empowered on behalf of the Soviet government to ask the   European governments for a credit of ten million pounds.    The work of obtaining the grain supplies started without delay.   Considerable sums of money were raised through private and   semiofficial organizations and from private donations; and large   shipments were made.    To solve the problem completely, it was essential to arrange a   loan to Russia since it was decided that the scheme could not and   should not be based on charity alone. This matter of a loan met   with a serious obstacle, for the Soviet government was not   recognized, nor the political system which it represented   approved, by the other governments6. Consequently, in spite of the   agreements concluded by Nansen, there were many who remained   unconvinced that the aid given would really benefit those for   whom it was intended.    Nansen’s hardest task was to break down this opposition. Time and   again he turned to the League of Nations for moral support in his   demand that credit be granted to the Russian state. In a powerful   speech, the words of which still ring in our ears, he argued   before the League of Nations that the rescue of millions from   death by starvation should not be impeded by political   considerations. Even if political considerations are taken into   account, he says, they too indicate that aid must be given. For   it is the very areas in Europe that have hitherto yielded the   largest exports of grain which are now being devastated. Can   Europe do without the Volga districts? Can it do without Russia?   Some argue that to send grain to Russia is to aid the Soviet   government. Nansen answers: I do not believe that we are   supporting the Soviet simply because we are showing the Russian   people that there is compassion in Europe. But suppose that such   aid would support the Soviet – is there any man who dares come   forward and say: It is better to allow twenty million people to   die of starvation than to support the Soviet government?    It has not been possible to obtain the credit for Russia. States   have contributed, Norway among others; private and semiofficial   organizations have raised large sums of money; but the help which   could have halted the disaster in the beginning has been   withheld.    The consequence is that the work has not yielded the results   which could have been achieved. Millions, it is true, have been   helped, and in the end nearly ten million were being kept alive.   But many have succumbed – between two and four million of them.   And since the harvest this year was poor because the spring   sowing was done by people who were starving and short of both   seed corn and working beasts, we can predict that the distress   will again be appalling when spring approaches.    Nansen has now been entrusted with a fourth mission of an   international character. As the High Commissioner of the League   of Nations, he is going to direct the work of aiding the   unfortunate people of all races and religions who have become   victims of the Greco-Turkish War. It is necessary above   all to help the refugees who are now streaming in from Eastern   Thrace and Asia Minor to the Balkan countries and Greece7. This work is now in progress, and the   newspapers carry reports of it every day.    These are the missions with which Nansen has been charged and the   work that he has accomplished, an account of which we wished to   give here. He has found at his side, however, not only a great   number of individuals, but also a series of organizations with   which he has worked and which deserve a large share of the credit   for the results obtained8.    The human mind cannot visualize this enormous activity any more   than it can grasp astronomical figures. One starving person, one   human being lying like forgotten wreckage on a street corner,   wasting away bit by bit – this we understand; here our feeling is   so strong it becomes compassion. One refugee, even a crowd of   refugees, if you like, pushing their children and their   possessions in wheelbarrows in front of them – this we   understand. But millions of these, hunted like game from country   to country, behind them the fires of their burning homes, before   them the emptiness of a future over which they have no control –   here our minds stop dead; instead of producing images, they   merely play back the statistics presented to them. Charity on an   intimate scale, even charity on a larger scale, for our   countrymen or for our provinces – this is within our reach; this   we understand. But a program whose aim is to rescue a continent’s   millions from misery and death – this presents proportions so   immense and involves such a myriad of jumbled details that we   give up and allow our minds to rest.    It will be the task of future generations to give this work its   proper place in world history. We who have lived through it can   merely make a few observations upon it.    And that is what I wish to do now.    What is it that has sustained the work? Is it the functioning of   the ordinary machinery of nations? Is it the stirring of the   consciences of politicians and statesmen which has found such   magnificent expression? Oh, no! The source lies deeper. It lies   in the fact that it was to the people themselves, to their   deepest and broadest stratum, that the appeal was addressed and   from them a world opinion crystallized. Indeed, war had to be   declared against all political considerations to enable   the idea and the feeling to break through the barriers erected by   nations, classes, and individuals. The appeal had to reach those   innermost depths in man which no statecraft can enter.    Men’s deepest feelings are often invoked, and often by politics.   But the feelings politics stirs up are most frequently those   which divide: national self-interest, class consciousness,   suspicion, lust for power. There are times, it is true, when   politics appeals to that which unites, not only to what unites   nations and social classes, but also to what binds mankind   together most closely. But this does not happen often. For me one   of the most important aspects of the work before us is that it   has penetrated the very depths of the human feeling which lies   buried within all of us, the feeling that the family of man is   one, whatever its national or social divisions. As Nansen   says in one of his speeches, it is love for one’s neighbor that   he has wished to enroll in the service of his work. And he has   succeeded. Progress has not been rapid, and the goal is still far   away. This wave of warmth rising from so deep within has struck   ice and cold. Nevertheless, it has advanced far enough that the   work it has supported has become an event in the history of   mankind.    In the forefront of it all we see a number of combatants, each   stationed at his post: organizations and individuals engaged year   after year in the struggle to clear a path through all the   barriers which stand between the victims of misfortune and their   rescuers. At their head we see first and foremost one single man.   What burdens he has borne upon his shoulders! What organizing   ability his work has demanded, what energy and initiative, what   self-sacrificing patience, what talent for coming straight to the   heart of any problem! What he has lived through, this man who has   seen Europe’s misery at first hand and who has felt a sense of   responsibility for it!    Seeing him in our midst today awakens many memories. Behind him   is a life which we have all, in our thoughts, lived with   him.    Perhaps what has most impressed all of us is his ability to stake   his life time and time again on a single idea, on one thought,   and to inspire others to follow him.    We remember a young boy, for he was but little more than that,   crossing Greenland on skis. He thought that up there in the North   where the costly expeditions from great nations always suffered   shipwreck, Norwegian sports equipment and Norwegian familiarity   with ice and snow would be able to succeed. He did succeed, and   his trip became a landmark in the history of Arctic   exploration.    We recall too a mature man who, on the basis of his scientific   knowledge, developed the theory that a current flows from east to   west across the Polar Sea. Nearly all the scientists believed   that he was wrong. But he staked his life on the theory; he   allowed himself to be frozen into the eastern ice to be carried   over the Pole. The current was there and carried him forward to   his goal9.    And is it not much the same thing that we have now witnessed? An   undercurrent in which few have believed has again carried Nansen   forward: the deep current of human feeling which lies beneath the   layer of ice in which nations and individuals encase themselves   during the daily struggles and the trials of life. He believed in   this current and because he did, his work has triumphed. May this   current also carry much for the future!    1.

"11","1925","Sir Austen Chamberlain, Charles G. Dawes"," We still remember it vividly, that event of   over eight years ago. For four long years the world had resounded   with the fearful din of the battlefields, the piercing cries of   the dying, the forlorn laments of parents and widows over the   bloody corpses of their sons and husbands. Then suddenly the terrible nightmare faded,   the roar of the cannons was stilled; the unbelievable had really   happened – the world war had ended! Europe breathed again, raised its head,   gazed out over the disconsolate fields of battle, over the   endless mounds of smoldering ruins, toward the horizon and the   breaking day. But the day would not be hurried. Dark clouds   gathered from all sides and spread from country to country;   stormy skies cast their menacing shadows first in one place, then   in another. It was as if everyone was waiting for a dawn which   would not come. Now insidious doubt seeps into men’s minds,   breeding a melancholy uneasiness. Fear takes hold, and the powers   of darkness gain sway. Suspicion and distrust grow between   nations, between classes, and only thistles prosper in such soil.   Hatred grows; increasing insecurity and fear paralyze all   initiative, opening the way to every kind of blunder. There is   talk of another war. It is as if the world, which had once before   hovered on the brink and peered down into the abyss but which had   at the eleventh hour dragged itself onto safer ground, is once   again in perilous darkness being drawn back into the depths. What is wrong? What is missing? It is the   good human qualities that can grow only in the light of day:   forbearance, confidence, compassion, the sincere desire for full   cooperation in rebuilding the world. A peace settlement following a ruinous war   can easily degenerate into the imposition by the victors of more   or less humiliating conditions upon the vanquished. Such terms,   in their turn can easily bear fruit which will in time ripen into   a fresh war. The Peace of Versailles can certainly not be said to   constitute an exception to this rule. The more protracted the   withering trial of war, the harsher the conditions imposed; so   when victory is finally won, the demands are difficult, or even   impossible, to fulfill. The coercion used to compel the   vanquished to give beyond their capabilities only breeds greater   hatred and the thirst for revenge. Failure to receive what the   victors consider their just compensation for the wounds suffered   in war begets disappointment and frustration. To these is added   the insecurity and fear of possible consequences when forcible   and oppressive means must be used to recover claims. The   difficulties mount steadily; nations move further and further   apart; insecurity, fear, anxiety foster rearmament. Such is the picture that Europe presented   in 1923, more than four years after the ending of the war. When   Germany found herself unable to pay the reparations to which the   French felt entitled, French troops marched into and occupied the   Ruhr. The result was the disruption of the entire production of   Europe. Hatred of France flared up in Germany more violently than   ever. Paralyzing despondency spread among people of all European   nations, and talk of the next war became more and more   common. Then, when the darkness was deepest,   America extended a helping hand. The United States had hitherto   kept out of the situation and was thus able to observe the   unhappy events in Europe calmly and in perspective. The Americans   now felt obliged to try to help Europe back onto her feet. An   idea which had already been voiced by U.S. Secretary of State   Hughes1 in December, 1922, now   gained increasing support. This was that Germany’s capacity to   pay reparations should be investigated by a competent committee   in order to obtain an expert scientific basis for future   deliberations. The idea eventually found favor with   Poincart and the French, and it was then agreed to appoint a   committee of experts; the American government sent Owen D. Young   and Charles G. Dawes, the latter becoming chairman of the   committee2. The first meeting took place in Paris on   January 14, 1924. By April 9 of the same year the committee had   drafted a plan, later known as the Dawes Plan. The committee   proposed that the reparations should be paid by an altogether   different system and that a moratorium should first be applied.   It further proposed, among other measures, the complete   reorganization of Germany’s finances and the granting of a   foreign loan. The plan also regarded as an economic necessity the   return of the Ruhr to Germany. The importance of this plan was already   evident from the fact that when it became apparent at the end of   July, 1924, that it would be accepted by the Allied governments,   confidence in the European economy immediately began to revive,   and there was a consequent and marked improvement in the strength   of European currency. It is true that the plan envisaged a   substantial reduction in the war reparations which Germany was to   pay, but it did at least seek to ensure a considerable payment   each year. Its adoption contributed to the decision to evacuate   the Ruhr. It also brought a temporary halt to the endless   conflicts about Germany’s reparations, which had been largely   responsible for the pessimistic outlook in Europe and for the   anxiety and insecurity which had characterized the first five   years of peace. The plan was important not only for   Germany, France, and the Allies, but; both economically and   politically, for the whole of Europe and consequently for America   as well. It restored confidence in the economy and future of   Europe. It brought her safely through an acute crisis which could   have resulted in the most serious danger to peace. But its   greatest significance lies in the fact that it was a symptom of a   psychological change in European mentality and at the same time a   powerful impetus for continued change. It marked the beginning of   the policy of reconciliation and peace which led to the Locarno   agreements. This was the first dawning of the day after the long   darkness. Another memorable step along the path of   peace was the Geneva Protocol adopted by the League of Nations   Assembly in the autumn of 19243.   For the first time the delegates of nations from all parts of the   world declared aggressive war to be a crime. They also adopted   the principle that all international controversies without   exception must be settled by peaceful means, either by   arbitration or before a court of law. It is true that the Protocol was not   ratified by the governments; nevertheless it is an important   milestone in history, and its spirit should not be ignored by the   statesmen of the future. For it was this spirit which prepared   the way for what was to be accomplished later. The next great   milestone bears the name of Locarno. The initiative on this   occasion came from Germany, from Chancellor Luther and Foreign   Minister Stresemann4. During the negotiations which preceded the   Geneva Protocol the French, and especially Briand, its warm   advocate, strongly urged the necessity of guarantees to provide   security against aggression and war. In a note dated February 9,   1925, Germany outlined the security guarantees which she believed   were required and suggested a possible form for a security treaty   which could “prepare the ground for a world convention of all   states similar to that arranged for the Geneva Protocol by the   League of Nations for the peaceful settlement of international   disagreements”. Following extensive negotiations, a meeting   took place in Locarno from October 5 to October 16 of 1925.   France was represented by Briand, Germany by Luther   and Stresemann, Great Britain by Chamberlain, Italy by Mussolini,   Belgium by Vandervelde, Poland by Skrzyriski, and Czechoslovakia   by Benes5. A treaty clarifying the   question of the Rhineland was concluded between Germany, Belgium,   France, Great Britain, and Italy, and four arbitration agreements   were made between Germany on the one side and Belgium, France,   Poland, and Czechoslovakia on the other. I shall not go into greater detail on the   provisions of these treaties, for they are well known. Of the   Rhineland treaty it has been said that for the first time since   Louis XIV6, the Rhine has ceased   to be a cause of dissension in European politics. So closes a   chapter in history. Under the four arbitration agreements the   nations undertake to submit to peaceful settlement through   impartial mediation or arbitration all disputes except those   “arising out of past events which took place prior to the present   agreement”. The Locarno agreements mark a radical and   complete change in European politics, transforming the relations   between the former antagonists in the war and infusing them with   an entirely new spirit. This spirit derives from the almost   unprecedented attempt to base politics on the principle of mutual   friendship and trust. What inspires one’s confidence is that it   was neither idealism nor altruism, but a sense of necessity which   prompted those concerned to make the attempt. The men who met at   Locarno are no idealistic pacifists; they are realistic   politicians and responsible statesmen who, having originally   pursued directly conflicting policies, have come to the   realization that the only chance of creating a real future for   mankind is to stand united in a sincere desire to work   together. In a speech he made after the signing of   the agreements, Briand aptly remarked: “The war has taught us one   thing, namely, that a common fate binds us together. If we go   under, we go under together. If we wish to recover, we cannot do   so in conflict with each other, but only by working   together.”7 Both Briand and Stresemann have rightly   emphasized that every individual must first be a good citizen of   his own country – a good Frenchman, a good German, a good Briton   – but still a good European bound to other Europeans by the great   ideals of the European civilization so gravely menaced by the   events of the last war. If we are to appreciate fully what these   statesmen accomplished at Locarno for the peace of Europe, then   we must not overlook the violent nationalistic opposition in   their own countries which several of them had to overcome in   order to push through the peace program. They strode ahead   fearlessly in the conviction that they had now found the right   road. With Locarno an accomplished fact, it   seemed as though a new day would be breaking and renewed courage   and confidence would be returning to Europe with ever increasing   tempo. But the agreements were not yet activated. One of their   provisions was that Germany should enter the League of Nations.   This step, however, was to encounter more serious difficulties   than had been anticipated. Still fresh in our memory is that   distressing special session of the Assembly at Geneva last March   when the delegates met for the sole purpose of admitting Germany   into the League, only to depart without having been able to do   it. But these events were followed by the   Assembly meeting at Geneva last September when Germany’s   delegates, with Stresemann at their head, were able to enter   honorably and take their places among the members of the League.   No one who was present will forget that moment. Germany’s admission was welcomed in a   remarkable speech by Briand. Among other things, he said: “No   more war!… From now on it will be for the judge to decide what   is right. Just as individual citizens settle their disagreements   before a judge, so shall we also resolve ours by peaceful means.   Away with rifles, machine guns, cannons. Make way for   conciliation, arbitration, peace!”8 On this point we can now see daylight   again. Is it not almost as if we are seeing the new earth turn   green again after Armageddon9? The Locarno Pacts, together with Germany’s   entry into the League of Nations and the speeches which followed   it, hold much promise for the future – they all tend to build up   confidence and to strengthen the will to carry on the good work.   But all this must not blind us to the fact that there is still a   long way to go before the goal is reached and lasting peace   really secured. Noble words and noble intent on the part of   leaders are a great encouragement, but they are not enough. Words   must be translated into action, intent into earnest toil, for   shining promises have often come to nothing in the past and the   blue skies of hope have again been filled by storm clouds. Our watchword must be: “No more war!” And   what does this mean? It does not mean “no more world war”, with   everyone, and especially the principal powers, free to indulge in   small private wars whenever they are so disposed. It does not   mean “no more war” except when a power is able, without any great   effort on its part, to crush a weak neighbor that falls easy prey   to superior force. It does not mean “no more war” except when   what we used to call national honor is at stake. It means none of these. What it does mean   is no more war of any kind whatsoever, no more aggression, no   more of the bloody and futile clashes which have tarnished the   history of mankind for so long. It means working to eradicate the   use of force from national policies; to stamp out suppression of   others in whatever form it appears; to liberate ourselves now and   for all time – as we in this generation can do if we so resolve –   from the hideous corruption of warfare between different groups   of the human race, be it between nations or within nations. I say without hesitation that this is the   greatest of all the causes which now command our attention. The   question of how we can put an end to all war is the vital problem   of our time, not only for international politics, but for   national politics as well. This may strike many people as an   exaggeration, even as a misuse of language. To them such problems   as those of miners’ strikes, social reform, customs barriers,   prohibition, or whatever, seem far more important. I say with   utter conviction that those who think so are wrong. War, preparation for war, the burden of   armament, particularly in the case of the larger countries –   these are the first and vital problems. If we can erect barriers   against war, if we can abolish the armament – burdens which   Europe suffers today, if we can destroy the evil specter of   militarism which still haunts the world and so vouchsafe complete   security for all time, then we shall obtain, and swiftly at that,   the social reforms we desire, the development of our resources,   the many forms of progress we hope for; we shall move forward   toward a new and better life. But if we do not get rid of war, if we do   not put a complete end to it, if Europe does not reduce and limit   its armaments, then we shall have no reforms and no progress of   any significance. We can be certain that in the future, just   as in the past, armament will call forth counterarmament,   alliances and counteralliances; it will engender suspicion and   distrust, bringing fear to men’s hearts; it will lead to   international crises; it will lead to war, perhaps to small local   wars at first, but, finally and inescapably, it will bring down   upon us a great world war no less frightful than the last. If the work for disarmament which the   League of Nations has now begun does not produce results, if the   level of armaments is maintained, then war will result. It seems   to me that all our past experience shows this to be   incontrovertible. But do not take my word for it. Listen to what   more qualified authorities have to say. Lord Grey, foreign minister of Great   Britain at the outbreak of the war10, has said, and he has said it time and   time again, that it was Europe’s steadily increasing armaments   which led to the war in 1914. He has warned us that if armaments   in Europe are maintained, if the nations of the world embark on a   new contest in military preparedness, we will bring upon   ourselves anew war as inevitably as we did the last one. And he   has told us that a new war will mean the end of our civilization   as we know it today. Who will question Lord Grey’s authority to   speak on this subject? Many other leading statesmen have uttered   the same sentiments on several occasions. Let me mention just   one. As recently as January of this year, Mr. Baldwin, the   present prime minister of Great Britain11, said: “A new war in the West and the   civilization of our era will collapse in a fall as great as that   of Rome.” These men I have mentioned are not   fanatics, indeed not even pacifists; they are responsible   statesmen who have exercised or who will in the future exercise   great power in the leadership of the world. If they mean their   statements seriously, then it seems to me to follow that there is   scarcely any other political problem worth discussing until the   problem of the next war is resolved. Let us pause for a moment to consider what   they have said. It may seem fantastic to state that our   civilization can be obliterated. We have a sense of vitality and strength, a   feeling that a great future lies ahead of us. But let us not   forget that civilizations have been wiped out before. Powerful   nations, which seemed as strong then as the most powerful states   of our time seem to us now, have vanished. The Roman Empire,   which ruled Europe for a period hundreds of years longer than the   lifetime of our modern Western civilization, was swept away by the   invasion of barbaric hordes. You have no sense of any impending   disaster, you are too conscious of the forces of life around you.   I feel the same. I too feel these forces. But I also sense that   the last war inflicted upon our civilization a terrible wound, a   painful wound that is still far from healed. It was as if the   very foundations shook under Europe. And, worst of all, most   Europeans still do not understand the true nature and   significance of the last war. They are already about to forget it   before they have learned the lesson it should teach them. They   are forgetting their dead. Of course, there are still millions of   people in practically every country of Europe who cannot forget   the horrors of the war. The carnage of the battlefields, once   seen, is not easily forgotten. These people can tell of the   merciless slaughter on the lovely countryside of France; of the   agony of mind, the terror inspired by the big bombardments and   the ceaseless rattle of gunfire in a modern offensive; of the   inconceivable suffering of wounded and broken men hanging perhaps   for days on barbed wire, crying out for the death which they   themselves had not the strength to inflict. Of such horrors and   worse can these people tell, and if Europe would only heed them,   if all its people would only remember the war’s bestiality, its   barbaric cruelty, they would see to it that war would never occur   again. But there are other aspects of war which I,   perhaps more than most people, have had the opportunity to   observe. For more than six years now, it has been my task, on   behalf of the League of Nations12, to investigate and as far as possible   to alleviate the terrible aftereffects of war. During all these   years I have had to deal with hundreds of thousands of prisoners   of war, with famine, with refugees – frightened refugees, each   with his own story of endless heartrending tragedy, the old, the   women, the little helpless children left alone because of the   vicissitudes of war, and all of them lost, plundered, bereft of   everything of value in this world. I wish I could give you a picture of what I   have seen and experienced. I wish I could just for one moment   make you feel what it is to see a whole nation fleeing in wild   terror along the country roads; or to travel among a people   struck down by famine; to enter huts where men, women, and   children lie still, no longer complaining, waiting only for death   in countries where corpses are dug up out of their graves and   eaten, where maddened mothers slay their own children for food.   But no, I cannot attempt it now. All this endless misfortune, all this   misery and incredible suffering, these hundreds of thousands of   forsaken prisoners of war, these famines, these millions of   helpless refugees – they are all, directly or indirectly, the   results of the war. But, believe me, all these calamities cannot   occur without undermining our entire social system; they sap the   vitality of nations and they inflict wounds so deep that they   will take a long time to heal, if they ever do. And still, even still, people talk about   the probability of another war. Do we not stop to think what this   would mean? Even if the next war is no worse than the last, I   believe it will destroy our European civilization. But of course   the next war will not be like the last. It will be incomparably   worse. I shall not weary you by going further into   that. It is enough to say that in the event of a new war we face   the threatening fact that our civilization can be annihilated,   just as other civilizations have been annihilated in the past.   But we also have the means to avert this threat. War does not   come unless we wish it upon ourselves. War is not the result of   some uncontrollable catastrophe of nature; it is the result of   man’s will. It is his own shame. And truly, with reasonable   policies, it would be comparatively easy to put an end to   war. Let me suggest the course which I believe   can lead us forward. The governments of Europe must unite around   and stake their all on what I shall, for the sake of brevity,   call the League of Nations policy. Do not misunderstand me here. The League of   Nations is no longer a remote or abstract idea. It is a living   organism. Its institutions are now an essential part of the   machinery of world control. If we can put the full force of the   combined power of individual governments behind these   institutions, behind the policy of disarmament, behind all the   policies pursued by the League, then we shall put an end to   war. But the governments, whether of large   countries or of small, must stake everything on this policy   without reservations. There must be no clinging to ancient rights   to wage private wars. There must be no secret hopes that, if the   League is weak in certain areas, it can be made to serve private   interests. We must follow the new road in   international politics mapped out at Locarno, and we must burn   behind us the bridges that lead back to the old policies and the   old systems which have failed us so tragically. It has always   been my conviction that, in the great things of life, it is of   decisive importance to have no line of retreat – a principle   which certainly holds good here. By the very nature of things, progress will   depend essentially on the actions of the great powers. But small   nations like our own can also do much. For the large states must   take into account such a variety of factors, such a multitude of   conflicting interests, that their leaders may often find it   difficult to follow their own convictions, assessing all the   time, as they must, the political currents among their   electorates, the national self-interests of their countries, not   to mention the complex intrigues which frequently surround them.   All these circumstances can often restrict their freedom to   act. Small nations and their leaders enjoy   greater latitude in this respect; they have fewer conflicting   interests, and for them a policy of peace without restrictions or   reservations is a natural one. If all the small nations will work   together resolutely and systematically in the League of Nations   to lay the ghost of war, they can achieve much, greatly   strengthening the League in the process. Certainly, it cannot be denied that the   great powers can give and on occasion have given the impression   of acting somewhat arbitrarily and without proper consideration   for the views of the other members of the League. But the small   nations have ample opportunity to state their case if they will   just confidently take it. And when they fail to do so, the blame   falls chiefly on themselves. As Briand said in his splendid   speech to the last Assembly, there must in future be no more   resorting to “methods of negotiation which are inconsistent with   the true spirit of the League of Nations”, and “the League’s work   shall in future take place in the full light of day and with the   collaboration of all its members.”13 It is, then, the duty of all members, and   not least of the small nations, to unite in the task of   abolishing war, to participate positively in this work, not to   wait passively but to act. If we really want to put an end to war, if   we want to be rid of heavy armaments, the governments must, as I   have said, stake everything upon the policy of the League of   Nations without thinking about any lines of retreat. They must   work in every way and at every opportunity to build up the power   and strength of the League. If they do so and if their peoples   support them in the same spirit, then shall the evil monster of   war be felled and our future secured for the work of peace, that   of building, not tearing down."
"12","1926","Aristide Briand, Gustav Stresemann"," We still remember it vividly, that event of   over eight years ago. For four long years the world had resounded   with the fearful din of the battlefields, the piercing cries of   the dying, the forlorn laments of parents and widows over the   bloody corpses of their sons and husbands. Then suddenly the terrible nightmare faded,   the roar of the cannons was stilled; the unbelievable had really   happened – the world war had ended! Europe breathed again, raised its head,   gazed out over the disconsolate fields of battle, over the   endless mounds of smoldering ruins, toward the horizon and the   breaking day. But the day would not be hurried. Dark clouds   gathered from all sides and spread from country to country;   stormy skies cast their menacing shadows first in one place, then   in another. It was as if everyone was waiting for a dawn which   would not come. Now insidious doubt seeps into men’s minds,   breeding a melancholy uneasiness. Fear takes hold, and the powers   of darkness gain sway. Suspicion and distrust grow between   nations, between classes, and only thistles prosper in such soil.   Hatred grows; increasing insecurity and fear paralyze all   initiative, opening the way to every kind of blunder. There is   talk of another war. It is as if the world, which had once before   hovered on the brink and peered down into the abyss but which had   at the eleventh hour dragged itself onto safer ground, is once   again in perilous darkness being drawn back into the depths. What is wrong? What is missing? It is the   good human qualities that can grow only in the light of day:   forbearance, confidence, compassion, the sincere desire for full   cooperation in rebuilding the world. A peace settlement following a ruinous war   can easily degenerate into the imposition by the victors of more   or less humiliating conditions upon the vanquished. Such terms,   in their turn can easily bear fruit which will in time ripen into   a fresh war. The Peace of Versailles can certainly not be said to   constitute an exception to this rule. The more protracted the   withering trial of war, the harsher the conditions imposed; so   when victory is finally won, the demands are difficult, or even   impossible, to fulfill. The coercion used to compel the   vanquished to give beyond their capabilities only breeds greater   hatred and the thirst for revenge. Failure to receive what the   victors consider their just compensation for the wounds suffered   in war begets disappointment and frustration. To these is added   the insecurity and fear of possible consequences when forcible   and oppressive means must be used to recover claims. The   difficulties mount steadily; nations move further and further   apart; insecurity, fear, anxiety foster rearmament. Such is the picture that Europe presented   in 1923, more than four years after the ending of the war. When   Germany found herself unable to pay the reparations to which the   French felt entitled, French troops marched into and occupied the   Ruhr. The result was the disruption of the entire production of   Europe. Hatred of France flared up in Germany more violently than   ever. Paralyzing despondency spread among people of all European   nations, and talk of the next war became more and more   common. Then, when the darkness was deepest,   America extended a helping hand. The United States had hitherto   kept out of the situation and was thus able to observe the   unhappy events in Europe calmly and in perspective. The Americans   now felt obliged to try to help Europe back onto her feet. An   idea which had already been voiced by U.S. Secretary of State   Hughes1 in December, 1922, now   gained increasing support. This was that Germany’s capacity to   pay reparations should be investigated by a competent committee   in order to obtain an expert scientific basis for future   deliberations. The idea eventually found favor with   Poincart and the French, and it was then agreed to appoint a   committee of experts; the American government sent Owen D. Young   and Charles G. Dawes, the latter becoming chairman of the   committee2. The first meeting took place in Paris on   January 14, 1924. By April 9 of the same year the committee had   drafted a plan, later known as the Dawes Plan. The committee   proposed that the reparations should be paid by an altogether   different system and that a moratorium should first be applied.   It further proposed, among other measures, the complete   reorganization of Germany’s finances and the granting of a   foreign loan. The plan also regarded as an economic necessity the   return of the Ruhr to Germany. The importance of this plan was already   evident from the fact that when it became apparent at the end of   July, 1924, that it would be accepted by the Allied governments,   confidence in the European economy immediately began to revive,   and there was a consequent and marked improvement in the strength   of European currency. It is true that the plan envisaged a   substantial reduction in the war reparations which Germany was to   pay, but it did at least seek to ensure a considerable payment   each year. Its adoption contributed to the decision to evacuate   the Ruhr. It also brought a temporary halt to the endless   conflicts about Germany’s reparations, which had been largely   responsible for the pessimistic outlook in Europe and for the   anxiety and insecurity which had characterized the first five   years of peace. The plan was important not only for   Germany, France, and the Allies, but; both economically and   politically, for the whole of Europe and consequently for America   as well. It restored confidence in the economy and future of   Europe. It brought her safely through an acute crisis which could   have resulted in the most serious danger to peace. But its   greatest significance lies in the fact that it was a symptom of a   psychological change in European mentality and at the same time a   powerful impetus for continued change. It marked the beginning of   the policy of reconciliation and peace which led to the Locarno   agreements. This was the first dawning of the day after the long   darkness. Another memorable step along the path of   peace was the Geneva Protocol adopted by the League of Nations   Assembly in the autumn of 19243.   For the first time the delegates of nations from all parts of the   world declared aggressive war to be a crime. They also adopted   the principle that all international controversies without   exception must be settled by peaceful means, either by   arbitration or before a court of law. It is true that the Protocol was not   ratified by the governments; nevertheless it is an important   milestone in history, and its spirit should not be ignored by the   statesmen of the future. For it was this spirit which prepared   the way for what was to be accomplished later. The next great   milestone bears the name of Locarno. The initiative on this   occasion came from Germany, from Chancellor Luther and Foreign   Minister Stresemann4. During the negotiations which preceded the   Geneva Protocol the French, and especially Briand, its warm   advocate, strongly urged the necessity of guarantees to provide   security against aggression and war. In a note dated February 9,   1925, Germany outlined the security guarantees which she believed   were required and suggested a possible form for a security treaty   which could “prepare the ground for a world convention of all   states similar to that arranged for the Geneva Protocol by the   League of Nations for the peaceful settlement of international   disagreements”. Following extensive negotiations, a meeting   took place in Locarno from October 5 to October 16 of 1925.   France was represented by Briand, Germany by Luther   and Stresemann, Great Britain by Chamberlain, Italy by Mussolini,   Belgium by Vandervelde, Poland by Skrzyriski, and Czechoslovakia   by Benes5. A treaty clarifying the   question of the Rhineland was concluded between Germany, Belgium,   France, Great Britain, and Italy, and four arbitration agreements   were made between Germany on the one side and Belgium, France,   Poland, and Czechoslovakia on the other. I shall not go into greater detail on the   provisions of these treaties, for they are well known. Of the   Rhineland treaty it has been said that for the first time since   Louis XIV6, the Rhine has ceased   to be a cause of dissension in European politics. So closes a   chapter in history. Under the four arbitration agreements the   nations undertake to submit to peaceful settlement through   impartial mediation or arbitration all disputes except those   “arising out of past events which took place prior to the present   agreement”. The Locarno agreements mark a radical and   complete change in European politics, transforming the relations   between the former antagonists in the war and infusing them with   an entirely new spirit. This spirit derives from the almost   unprecedented attempt to base politics on the principle of mutual   friendship and trust.

In a speech he made after the signing of   the agreements, Briand aptly remarked: “The war has taught us one   thing, namely, that a common fate binds us together. If we go   under, we go under together. If we wish to recover, we cannot do   so in conflict with each other, but only by working   together.”7 Both Briand and Stresemann have rightly   emphasized that every individual must first be a good citizen of   his own country – a good Frenchman, a good German, a good Briton   – but still a good European bound to other Europeans by the great   ideals of the European civilization so gravely menaced by the   events of the last war.

As recently as January of this year, Mr. Baldwin, the   present prime minister of Great Britain11, said: “A new war in the West and the   civilization of our era will collapse in a fall as great as that   of Rome.” These men I have mentioned are not   fanatics, indeed not even pacifists; they are responsible   statesmen who have exercised or who will in the future exercise   great power in the leadership of the world. If they mean their   statements seriously, then it seems to me to follow that there is   scarcely any other political problem worth discussing until the   problem of the next war is resolved. Let us pause for a moment to consider what   they have said. It may seem fantastic to state that our   civilization can be obliterated. We have a sense of vitality and strength, a   feeling that a great future lies ahead of us. But let us not   forget that civilizations have been wiped out before. Powerful   nations, which seemed as strong then as the most powerful states   of our time seem to us now, have vanished. The Roman Empire,   which ruled Europe for a period hundreds of years longer than the   lifetime of our modern Western civilization, was swept away by the   invasion of barbaric hordes. You have no sense of any impending   disaster, you are too conscious of the forces of life around you.   I feel the same. I too feel these forces. But I also sense that   the last war inflicted upon our civilization a terrible wound, a   painful wound that is still far from healed. It was as if the   very foundations shook under Europe. And, worst of all, most   Europeans still do not understand the true nature and   significance of the last war. They are already about to forget it   before they have learned the lesson it should teach them. They   are forgetting their dead. Of course, there are still millions of   people in practically every country of Europe who cannot forget   the horrors of the war. The carnage of the battlefields, once   seen, is not easily forgotten. These people can tell of the   merciless slaughter on the lovely countryside of France; of the   agony of mind, the terror inspired by the big bombardments and   the ceaseless rattle of gunfire in a modern offensive; of the   inconceivable suffering of wounded and broken men hanging perhaps   for days on barbed wire, crying out for the death which they   themselves had not the strength to inflict. Of such horrors and   worse can these people tell, and if Europe would only heed them,   if all its people would only remember the war’s bestiality, its   barbaric cruelty, they would see to it that war would never occur   again. But there are other aspects of war which I,   perhaps more than most people, have had the opportunity to   observe. For more than six years now, it has been my task, on   behalf of the League of Nations12, to investigate and as far as possible   to alleviate the terrible aftereffects of war. During all these   years I have had to deal with hundreds of thousands of prisoners   of war, with famine, with refugees – frightened refugees, each   with his own story of endless heartrending tragedy, the old, the   women, the little helpless children left alone because of the   vicissitudes of war, and all of them lost, plundered, bereft of   everything of value in this world. I wish I could give you a picture of what I   have seen and experienced. I wish I could just for one moment   make you feel what it is to see a whole nation fleeing in wild   terror along the country roads; or to travel among a people   struck down by famine; to enter huts where men, women, and   children lie still, no longer complaining, waiting only for death   in countries where corpses are dug up out of their graves and   eaten, where maddened mothers slay their own children for food.   But no, I cannot attempt it now. All this endless misfortune, all this   misery and incredible suffering, these hundreds of thousands of   forsaken prisoners of war, these famines, these millions of   helpless refugees – they are all, directly or indirectly, the   results of the war. But, believe me, all these calamities cannot   occur without undermining our entire social system; they sap the   vitality of nations and they inflict wounds so deep that they   will take a long time to heal, if they ever do. And still, even still, people talk about   the probability of another war. Do we not stop to think what this   would mean? Even if the next war is no worse than the last, I   believe it will destroy our European civilization. But of course   the next war will not be like the last. It will be incomparably   worse. I shall not weary you by going further into   that. It is enough to say that in the event of a new war we face   the threatening fact that our civilization can be annihilated,   just as other civilizations have been annihilated in the past.   But we also have the means to avert this threat. War does not   come unless we wish it upon ourselves. War is not the result of   some uncontrollable catastrophe of nature; it is the result of   man’s will. It is his own shame. And truly, with reasonable   policies, it would be comparatively easy to put an end to   war. Let me suggest the course which I believe   can lead us forward. The governments of Europe must unite around   and stake their all on what I shall, for the sake of brevity,   call the League of Nations policy. Do not misunderstand me here. The League of   Nations is no longer a remote or abstract idea. It is a living   organism. Its institutions are now an essential part of the   machinery of world control. If we can put the full force of the   combined power of individual governments behind these   institutions, behind the policy of disarmament, behind all the   policies pursued by the League, then we shall put an end to   war. But the governments, whether of large   countries or of small, must stake everything on this policy   without reservations. There must be no clinging to ancient rights   to wage private wars. There must be no secret hopes that, if the   League is weak in certain areas, it can be made to serve private   interests. We must follow the new road in   international politics mapped out at Locarno, and we must burn   behind us the bridges that lead back to the old policies and the   old systems which have failed us so tragically. It has always   been my conviction that, in the great things of life, it is of   decisive importance to have no line of retreat – a principle   which certainly holds good here. By the very nature of things, progress will   depend essentially on the actions of the great powers. But small   nations like our own can also do much. For the large states must   take into account such a variety of factors, such a multitude of   conflicting interests, that their leaders may often find it   difficult to follow their own convictions, assessing all the   time, as they must, the political currents among their   electorates, the national self-interests of their countries, not   to mention the complex intrigues which frequently surround them.   All these circumstances can often restrict their freedom to   act. Small nations and their leaders enjoy   greater latitude in this respect; they have fewer conflicting   interests, and for them a policy of peace without restrictions or   reservations is a natural one. If all the small nations will work   together resolutely and systematically in the League of Nations   to lay the ghost of war, they can achieve much, greatly   strengthening the League in the process. Certainly, it cannot be denied that the   great powers can give and on occasion have given the impression   of acting somewhat arbitrarily and without proper consideration   for the views of the other members of the League. But the small   nations have ample opportunity to state their case if they will   just confidently take it. And when they fail to do so, the blame   falls chiefly on themselves. As Briand said in his splendid   speech to the last Assembly, there must in future be no more   resorting to “methods of negotiation which are inconsistent with   the true spirit of the League of Nations”, and “the League’s work   shall in future take place in the full light of day and with the   collaboration of all its members.”13 It is, then, the duty of all members, and   not least of the small nations, to unite in the task of   abolishing war, to participate positively in this work, not to   wait passively but to act. If we really want to put an end to war, if   we want to be rid of heavy armaments, the governments must, as I   have said, stake everything upon the policy of the League of   Nations without thinking about any lines of retreat. They must   work in every way and at every opportunity to build up the power   and strength of the League. If they do so and if their peoples   support them in the same spirit, then shall the evil monster of   war be felled and our future secured for the work of peace, that   of building, not tearing down."
"13","1927","Ferdinand Buisson, Ludwig Quidde"," The Nobel Committee has awarded the Peace   Prize for this year jointly to Ferdinand Buisson and Ludwig   Quidde.    At last year’s ceremony the Committee gave prominence to three   events of historical significance to the world: the Dawes Plan,   the Locarno Pact, and Germany’s admission to the League of   Nations. These were political measures effected by responsible   agents of government, and we emphasized their importance by   awarding the Peace Prize to four statesmen1 who had rendered outstanding service in   making them possible.    This year we pay tribute through the Nobel Prize to a different   kind of work for the cause of peace. Governments and their   policies are not the only potential menace to peace. A constant   and real threat of war also lies in the mentality of men, in the   psychology of the masses. Therefore the great organized work for   peace must be preceded by the education of the people, by a   campaign to turn mass thinking away from war as a recognized   means of settling disputes, and to substitute another and much   higher ideal: peaceful cooperation between nations, with an   international court of justice to resolve any disagreements which   might arise between them. It is in the task of reorienting public   opinion that Buisson and Quidde have played such prominent roles.   They have guided this work in two countries where it has been   particularly difficult to accomplish, but where the need for it   has been commensurately great. In presenting the Nobel Peace   Prize to Buisson and Quidde, the Nobel Committee wishes to   recognize the emergence in France and Germany of a public opinion   which favors peaceful international cooperation. It is this happy   circumstance which brought about the rapprochement between   Germany and France, which in turn found expression in the events   rewarded at last year’s award ceremony.    Ferdinand Buisson was born in Paris in 1841. He studied   philosophy and pedagogy but was later unable to obtain a position   in France because he refused to take the oath to the   Emperor2. He therefore went to   Switzerland where he stayed from 1866 to 1870. Upon his return to   France in the autumn of 1870 he held various educational posts   and in 1879 was appointed, director of the primary school section   of the Ministry of Public Instruction. In this capacity he was   actively concerned in the drafting and implementing of the laws   on free, compulsory, and nondenominational primary education in   France. In 1897 he became professor of education at the   Sorbonne.    The Dreyfus case3 brought Buisson   into politics. He threw himself heart and soul into the struggle   waged on behalf of this unjustly convicted man. He joined the   French League of the Rights of Man, which, inspired by Zola’s   J’accuse4, was founded at   the time of the Dreyfus affair. The aim of this society was to   attack every form of injustice and oppression both in France and   elsewhere. As a member of the Radical-Socialist Party, Buisson   was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1902. Although defeated   in 1914, he returned to the Chamber in 1919, holding his seat   until 1924.    The cause of peace first attracted Buisson when he was still a   young man. He took part in the first congress of the Ligue de la   paix et de la liberté5   [League of Peace and Liberty] in 1867 and wrote articles   denouncing militarism and insisting that intensive education of   the masses was the way to put an end to war.    When the World War came, Buisson did not protest it. Regarding   France as the attacked party, he believed that a German victory   would mean defeat for justice and the principle of international   solidarity. During the early years of the war the League also   remained passive. The essential thing, said Buisson, was to win   in order to put an end not only to this war, but to all wars.   Convinced that the Allies would win in the end, he was greatly   concerned that they should not misuse their victory but should   take action to lay the foundations for a new, international world   by creating a League of Nations. From 1916 on he worked   tirelessly for a just peace and supported Wilson‘s program.    The peace turned out to be a bitter disappointment for Buisson.   In an open letter published on May 23, 1919, he criticized the   League of Nations as it had been structured, and described it as   a league of the victorious powers of the Entente. It was   nevertheless a fait accompli; it must be defended. It was   therefore necessary to put propaganda to work, with a view to   shaping the League into an efficient instrument for the   prevention of war and for the promotion of international   solidarity. In a eulogy on Wilson in 1924 he expressed his belief   that the League would grow, that the day would come when it would   be a force claiming the respect of the whole world, even of those   who then dismissed it with a smile. And he preached the   disarmament of hatred, for this must precede the disarmament of   nations.    Buisson and his friends have not confined themselves merely to   talking about the disarmament of hatred; they have sought to make   it a living fact. At the time of the Ruhr dispute6 they had the courage to try to build a   bridge by inviting German friends of peace to Paris and then   returning the visit to do what they could in Germany. Buisson, at   the age of eighty-four, accompanied the delegation. Speaking on a   number of occasions, he concluded one address to the German   people with these words:    «A force exists which is far greater than France, far   greater than Germany, far greater than any nation, and that is   mankind. But above mankind itself stands justice, which finds its   most perfect expression in human brotherhood.»    Ludwig Quidde was born in Bremen in 1858. He studied at   Strasbourg and Göttingen, his main interest being the   history of Germany in the Middle Ages. After taking his   doctorate, he devoted some years to historical writing and   publishing. This pursuit took him to Rome for a few years as a   staff member of the Prussian Historical Institute there.   Following his return to Germany, he threw himself into political   activity and especially into work for peace. Being of independent   means, he had no need to find paid employment and was therefore   in a position to devote his undivided efforts to his chosen   interests.    While he was in Rome, Quidde wrote Caligula (1894), a   small pamphlet of some sixteen pages. Ostensibly an historically   accurate description of the emperor Caligula7 and the mad obsessions from which he   suffered, it was actually a rather transparent satire on Emperor   Wilhelm II8. The book created a   storm. It had an enormous sale, reputedly reaching a printing of   several hundred thousand copies. Many people were naturally   delighted with it. But in others it aroused bitter resentment,   and for years afterwards Quidde was to learn in various ways how   deeply the wound had been felt.    Quidde’s work for peace began about the time Caligula   appeared. Ever since then he has worked ceaselessly as lecturer   and organizer. He has taken part in, and in many cases presided   over, numerous peace congresses; he has attended conferences of   the Interparliamentary Union9; and he has written countless publications,   some of which treated current problems so trenchantly as to lead   to their confiscation and even to the institution of legal   proceedings against their author.    For Quidde the outbreak of war heralded a period of intensive and   diversified activity. He went immediately to The Hague, thinking   that from neutral Holland he would be able to keep alive his   connections with the French, English, and Belgian pacifists. In   this he was disappointed. And so he returned to Germany but tried   even from there to sway public opinion in the other belligerent   countries.    His work was divided between organization and writing. The war   and all the problems it raised led to friction within the   pacifist camp in Germany, impeded organizational operations, and   made great demands on Quidde’s ability as a mediator. However, he   succeeded not only in holding the movement together, but also in   increasing support for the peace organizations. All this work   left Quidde little time to write. Of the things he published   during and after the war I should like to mention two which seem   to me to be characteristic of his views and of his manner of   working.    In 1915 he published a pamphlet entitled Sollen wir   annektieren? [Should We Annex?]. In this pamphlet he mounts   an attack on the desire for annexation which at that stage of the   war found wide support in Germany. To him it was sheer lunacy to   try to secure the peace by destroying the antagonist. In this   publication he takes no marked political standpoint but sets out   in a calm, well-balanced, and pertinently documented argument the   political, economic, and cultural consequences of a peace based   on annexation. He himself submits a positive program for peace,   whose chief point is that the freedom of the seas and the Open   Door policy10 should be secured   through the peace settlement. The pamphlet was confiscated. A   revised edition met the same fate, but this did not prevent it   and a French translation of it from reaching a wide public.    When the question of guilt arose at the end of the war, Quidde   entered the discussion with his pamphlet Die Schuldfrage   [The Question of Responsibility]11. Once again his subject is calmly   reasoned. He goes to the root of the question, distinguishing   between responsibility for creating the circumstances which paved   the way for the World War and responsibility for the actions   which unleashed war at the decisive moment. He does not share the   view of those members of the German pacifist movement who lay all   the blame at Germany’s door, and, as one might expect, he is even   less inclined to the other extreme. Calmly and without passion he   draws the distinction between responsibility and guilt, analyzing   the interrelationship of the many factors involved.    Two qualities stand out in Quidde’s writing and in his work as a   whole: moderation and courage. Although he has never had a chance   to publish major works outside his professional field of history,   all of his work beats the stamp of the historian and the scholar.   And he has displayed his courage on many occasions. His own   account of the origins of Caligula and of the events   associated with it is characteristic of the man. As already   mentioned, the book appears on the face of it to be an objective   portrayal of the Roman emperor’s life and character. In order to   make sure that it was historically accurate and that it had been   in no way colored by the political purpose behind it, he had the   manuscript read by several scholars specializing in Roman   history. When he decided to print the pamphlet, his friends   advised him to do so in Switzerland and to publish it   anonymously. But he had it printed in Germany under his own name.   After the pamphlet’s appearance when everyone expected him to be   prosecuted, his friends advised him to flee to Switzerland. But   he stood fast and remained in his own country. My impression is   that Quidde’s later writings are also imbued with the same   devotion to the truth, and their publication has on occasion   demanded no less courage.    Today the Nobel Committee honors two admirable and distinguished   servants of peace. We thank them for their long and tireless   efforts in the cause of peace. To work for the cause of peace is   to clear a path for honest and just relations between peoples,   for recognition of the intrinsic worth of human beings and of the   equal right of all people to live here on earth, and for the   success of the greatest political idea ever conceived: the   supplanting of war by peace.    1.

When evidence pointing toward Major   Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy as the real traitor was brought   forward several times in succeeding years and silenced, the case   became a major political issue throughout France.

"14","1929","Frank B. Kellogg","   It might appear that this year’s two Peace Prize winners are widely separated, not only in the geographical sense by the ocean which separates their two countries, but also in the area of their activities and in the nature of their contributions to the cause that concerns us here. One is a man of the world engaged in practical politics, the other a man of the church, a soldier of the spirit. But just as it is said that all roads lead to the Eternal City, so it can also truthfully be claimed that many are the roads which must be followed and many the means which must be explored if the human race is to attain the great and sacred goal which is eternal peace among nations. To achieve this goal, practical efforts to promote better collaboration in commercial and economic affairs – such as in developing easier and faster means of communication – and similar efforts in cultural affairs can and should go hand in hand with purely political efforts. But the steps that are taken and the progress which is made are unfortunately not always readily apparent. The obstacles to be surmounted, the opposition to be overcome, are formidable in magnitude and number. And the problems are not just of a practical or political character; they are frequently to be found in the minds of men, in the warlike mentality which is so tragically passed on from one generation to the next, a legacy which our own generation, in spite of its fearsome experiences, has failed to disclaim. Alfred Nobel himself had no illusions as to the difficulties and the complexity of work for peace. For this reason he placed no strict limitations on his Peace Prize; any serious and noble effort to advance the cause of peace could qualify. At a very early date he perceived the value of an international association of states, such as we now have in the League of Nations. He had already formulated this thought in January, 1893, when, in a letter to Bertha von Suttner, he outlined his ideas for a Peace Prize which might be awarded to the person or organization making the greatest contribution toward the attainment of the ideal of universal peace1. It is thus in full accord with Alfred Nobel’s conception of work for peace that no restrictions are imposed on the manner in which it is performed. Nor can it be otherwise. For in this work, both hand and heart are required. How wonderful it now is to see all the world’s might united in advancing this great cause, and how happy we are that this work can bridge not only the narrow national frontiers of our little part of the world but also the vast expanse separating the continents. And even if we could wish that this cooperation had found greater support, we cannot lose sight of what has already been accomplished: that the League of Nations, the greatest, the most powerful, the most remarkable institution acting for peace that the world has ever known has been established, thanks to the initiative of the United States. The League of Nations, that gigantic world monument which President Wilson erected in 1918 above the ruins of war and peace2, to the glory of his own country and for the happiness and salvation of the world! The deepest shadow which has so far been cast over the organization is the sad fact that Wilson’s own country has not become a member3. Fortunately this has not meant that the United States of America has taken no part in the great international work for peace and understanding which has been conducted during the twelve years since the war. Time and again the initiative and the cooperation of the U.S.A. have left a deep and enduring mark on this work, and the pact which bears the name of the man who sits today in our midst exemplifies not only the efforts put forth by the U.S.A. but also a sound and conscientious collaboration on the international front for the advancement of peace. The movement in favor of the «outlawry of war», to proclaim war illegal and to label it a crime, had gained increasing support in the U.S.A. ever since the end of the World War. Mr. Briand, France’s great champion of peace, made a point of choosing a memorable date in the American calendar – April 6, 1927 – the tenth anniversary of the entry of the United States into the war, to declare himself a disciple of that movement: «If there were any need between these two great democracies [the United States and France] to testify more convincingly in favor of peace and to present to the peoples a more solemn example, France would be ready publicly to subscribe, with the United States, to any mutual engagement tending, as between those two countries, to ‹outlaw war›, to use an American expression.»4 And on June 20, 1927, Briand handed to the American ambassador in Paris a draft of a treaty of perpetual friendship between the two countries. According to the draft, the two parties would solemnly declare that they condemned war and renounced it as an instrument of their national policies. On the other side of the Atlantic, Frank B. Kellogg, the U.S. Secretary of State, elevated this proposal to the status of the world pact to which we pay tribute today in the person of its author: «The Government of the United States is prepared, therefore, to concert with the Government of France with a view to the conclusion of a treaty among the principal Powers of the world, open to signature by all nations, condemning war and renouncing it as an instrument of national policy in favor of the pacific settlement of international disputes.»5 And from this common action emerged the pact that today binds together almost all civilized nations in the world. Article I of the Pact states the following: «The High Contracting Parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.» Seldom has an inscription been as appropriate as that which the town of Le Havre inscribed on the box holding the gold pen it presented to Frank B. Kellogg as he stepped ashore on his way to Paris to join France and other leading world powers in signing the pact on August 27, 1928: Si vis pacem, para pacem. We fully realize that a number of countries have made significant reservations with regard to the Kellogg Pact, and we realize, too, that a long road remains to be traveled between the signing of the pact and its fulfillment in spirit and in action. We realize that theory should not be mistaken for reality. And we also realize that the collaboration of all nations, of which the Kellogg Pact is the great outcome, must be extended to fields other than the purely political. For, however deep and menacing may be the political divergences between nations, it is not at all unlikely that differences in the field of commercial and economic politics constitute an equally grave threat to peace. The problem of the war debt, which still weighs heavily upon economic progress, must be resolved finally and effectively. And we must, in the interest of peace, try to counteract, with no less vigor than we devote to the fight against senseless military armament, the isolationist policies which can bring only misery and unemployment and which obstruct the free exchange and healthy distribution of world production. In these domains too, cooperation between all nations is indispensable, cooperation based on an appreciation of its importance for the well-being of the entire world. We shall not, however, succeed until our minds and thoughts become attuned to peace, until our present mentality is completely transformed. Archbishop Söderblom has said, «The Kellogg Pact is a solemn declaration, invaluable if life is brought into conformity with its words, delusory if actions contradict its great and noble sentiments.» And that is the crux of the matter: the need to animate this pact – as it has been the need for so many other attempts to safeguard peace – with the light of the Word, the truth of the spirit, the courage of the will. We must bring people to understand that it is not enough to proclaim war to be a crime, but that it is necessary for all men to recognize with every sense and emotion that the murder of hundreds of thousands of human beings to settle an international dispute is no more justifiable, no more pardonable than the murder of a single individual to settle some personal quarrel. «The day», said Briand in the great speech he delivered at the League of Nations last year, «when children are taught to respect the people of other nations and to seek that which unites men rather than that which divides them, then we shall have no more need of treaties – then peace will truly reign among nations.»6 Archbishop Nathan Söderblom’s great achievement is that he has thrown the power of the spirit into the fight for peace. A holder of high ecclesiastical office, he understands the enormous importance of the church in this fight, the powerful influence which it can bring to bear. The Christian church has sinned grievously and often against the teaching of Him whose first commandment to men was that they should love one another. This church surely has a unique opportunity now of creating that new attitude of mind which is necessary if peace between nations is to become reality. «Peace in the heart and peace on earth make up the task of the church, so long as it bears the name of the Prince of Peace.» «The spirit of Geneva». said Robert de Traz7, «dedicated to the salvation of mankind but seeing it only in its universal aspect, is now seen to pervade ecclesiastical circles shattered by war. Born of Christianity, the spirit of peace now returns to it. Today it no longer inspires politicians, economists and lawyers alone, it seeks to penetrate into the human mind! If a new war threatens, the churches will not, this time, bless the guns. They will halt the nations in the name of Him who called Himself the Prince of Peace. At least they say this and they commit themselves to it. And because in 1914 they denied their Master more than twice, they now beg mankind for forgiveness.» In Schiller’s lovely «Das Lied von der Glocke», the church bell rings out the praise of peace in solemn tones: Holder Friede,
süsse Eintracht,
weilet, weilet

"15","1930","Nathan Söderblom","   It might appear that this year’s two Peace Prize winners are widely separated, not only in the geographical sense by the ocean which separates their two countries, but also in the area of their activities and in the nature of their contributions to the cause that concerns us here. One is a man of the world engaged in practical politics, the other a man of the church, a soldier of the spirit. But just as it is said that all roads lead to the Eternal City, so it can also truthfully be claimed that many are the roads which must be followed and many the means which must be explored if the human race is to attain the great and sacred goal which is eternal peace among nations. To achieve this goal, practical efforts to promote better collaboration in commercial and economic affairs – such as in developing easier and faster means of communication – and similar efforts in cultural affairs can and should go hand in hand with purely political efforts. But the steps that are taken and the progress which is made are unfortunately not always readily apparent. The obstacles to be surmounted, the opposition to be overcome, are formidable in magnitude and number. And the problems are not just of a practical or political character; they are frequently to be found in the minds of men, in the warlike mentality which is so tragically passed on from one generation to the next, a legacy which our own generation, in spite of its fearsome experiences, has failed to disclaim. Alfred Nobel himself had no illusions as to the difficulties and the complexity of work for peace. For this reason he placed no strict limitations on his Peace Prize; any serious and noble effort to advance the cause of peace could qualify. At a very early date he perceived the value of an international association of states, such as we now have in the League of Nations. He had already formulated this thought in January, 1893, when, in a letter to Bertha von Suttner, he outlined his ideas for a Peace Prize which might be awarded to the person or organization making the greatest contribution toward the attainment of the ideal of universal peace1. It is thus in full accord with Alfred Nobel’s conception of work for peace that no restrictions are imposed on the manner in which it is performed. Nor can it be otherwise. For in this work, both hand and heart are required. How wonderful it now is to see all the world’s might united in advancing this great cause, and how happy we are that this work can bridge not only the narrow national frontiers of our little part of the world but also the vast expanse separating the continents. And even if we could wish that this cooperation had found greater support, we cannot lose sight of what has already been accomplished: that the League of Nations, the greatest, the most powerful, the most remarkable institution acting for peace that the world has ever known has been established, thanks to the initiative of the United States. The League of Nations, that gigantic world monument which President Wilson erected in 1918 above the ruins of war and peace2, to the glory of his own country and for the happiness and salvation of the world! The deepest shadow which has so far been cast over the organization is the sad fact that Wilson’s own country has not become a member3. Fortunately this has not meant that the United States of America has taken no part in the great international work for peace and understanding which has been conducted during the twelve years since the war. Time and again the initiative and the cooperation of the U.S.A. have left a deep and enduring mark on this work, and the pact which bears the name of the man who sits today in our midst exemplifies not only the efforts put forth by the U.S.A. but also a sound and conscientious collaboration on the international front for the advancement of peace. The movement in favor of the «outlawry of war», to proclaim war illegal and to label it a crime, had gained increasing support in the U.S.A. ever since the end of the World War. Mr. Briand, France’s great champion of peace, made a point of choosing a memorable date in the American calendar – April 6, 1927 – the tenth anniversary of the entry of the United States into the war, to declare himself a disciple of that movement: «If there were any need between these two great democracies [the United States and France] to testify more convincingly in favor of peace and to present to the peoples a more solemn example, France would be ready publicly to subscribe, with the United States, to any mutual engagement tending, as between those two countries, to ‹outlaw war›, to use an American expression.»4 And on June 20, 1927, Briand handed to the American ambassador in Paris a draft of a treaty of perpetual friendship between the two countries. According to the draft, the two parties would solemnly declare that they condemned war and renounced it as an instrument of their national policies. On the other side of the Atlantic, Frank B. Kellogg, the U.S. Secretary of State, elevated this proposal to the status of the world pact to which we pay tribute today in the person of its author: «The Government of the United States is prepared, therefore, to concert with the Government of France with a view to the conclusion of a treaty among the principal Powers of the world, open to signature by all nations, condemning war and renouncing it as an instrument of national policy in favor of the pacific settlement of international disputes.»5 And from this common action emerged the pact that today binds together almost all civilized nations in the world. Article I of the Pact states the following: «The High Contracting Parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.» Seldom has an inscription been as appropriate as that which the town of Le Havre inscribed on the box holding the gold pen it presented to Frank B. Kellogg as he stepped ashore on his way to Paris to join France and other leading world powers in signing the pact on August 27, 1928: Si vis pacem, para pacem. We fully realize that a number of countries have made significant reservations with regard to the Kellogg Pact, and we realize, too, that a long road remains to be traveled between the signing of the pact and its fulfillment in spirit and in action. We realize that theory should not be mistaken for reality. And we also realize that the collaboration of all nations, of which the Kellogg Pact is the great outcome, must be extended to fields other than the purely political. For, however deep and menacing may be the political divergences between nations, it is not at all unlikely that differences in the field of commercial and economic politics constitute an equally grave threat to peace. The problem of the war debt, which still weighs heavily upon economic progress, must be resolved finally and effectively. And we must, in the interest of peace, try to counteract, with no less vigor than we devote to the fight against senseless military armament, the isolationist policies which can bring only misery and unemployment and which obstruct the free exchange and healthy distribution of world production. In these domains too, cooperation between all nations is indispensable, cooperation based on an appreciation of its importance for the well-being of the entire world. We shall not, however, succeed until our minds and thoughts become attuned to peace, until our present mentality is completely transformed. Archbishop Söderblom has said, «The Kellogg Pact is a solemn declaration, invaluable if life is brought into conformity with its words, delusory if actions contradict its great and noble sentiments.» And that is the crux of the matter: the need to animate this pact – as it has been the need for so many other attempts to safeguard peace – with the light of the Word, the truth of the spirit, the courage of the will. We must bring people to understand that it is not enough to proclaim war to be a crime, but that it is necessary for all men to recognize with every sense and emotion that the murder of hundreds of thousands of human beings to settle an international dispute is no more justifiable, no more pardonable than the murder of a single individual to settle some personal quarrel. «The day», said Briand in the great speech he delivered at the League of Nations last year, «when children are taught to respect the people of other nations and to seek that which unites men rather than that which divides them, then we shall have no more need of treaties – then peace will truly reign among nations.»6 Archbishop Nathan Söderblom’s great achievement is that he has thrown the power of the spirit into the fight for peace. A holder of high ecclesiastical office, he understands the enormous importance of the church in this fight, the powerful influence which it can bring to bear. The Christian church has sinned grievously and often against the teaching of Him whose first commandment to men was that they should love one another. This church surely has a unique opportunity now of creating that new attitude of mind which is necessary if peace between nations is to become reality. «Peace in the heart and peace on earth make up the task of the church, so long as it bears the name of the Prince of Peace.» «The spirit of Geneva». said Robert de Traz7, «dedicated to the salvation of mankind but seeing it only in its universal aspect, is now seen to pervade ecclesiastical circles shattered by war. Born of Christianity, the spirit of peace now returns to it. Today it no longer inspires politicians, economists and lawyers alone, it seeks to penetrate into the human mind! If a new war threatens, the churches will not, this time, bless the guns. They will halt the nations in the name of Him who called Himself the Prince of Peace. At least they say this and they commit themselves to it. And because in 1914 they denied their Master more than twice, they now beg mankind for forgiveness.» In Schiller’s lovely «Das Lied von der Glocke», the church bell rings out the praise of peace in solemn tones: Holder Friede,
süsse Eintracht,
weilet, weilet

"16","1931","Jane Addams, Nicholas Murray Butler"," In awarding the Peace Prize to two   Americans, the Nobel Committee today brings the United States into   first place among those nations whose representatives have   received the prize during the past thirty years. Previously,   France had the highest number of prizewinners, a total of six,   while other nations had no more than two or three. As of today,   seven Peace Prizes will have gone to America, four of them during   the last five years.    What is true of the other Nobel awards is also true of the Peace   Prize: people do not always agree that it is given to the most   suitable candidates. And no one is more aware of the difficulties   involved in the selection than the members of the Nobel   Committee. But I trust everyone will agree that it is only   natural that so many Peace Prizes should have gone to the United   States in recent years.    The United States of America is a world in itself, as large as   the whole of Europe; and this world is a great land of peace   where war between states, either economic or military, is   unthinkable. But the United States is, at the same time, one of   the great world powers and economically is now the greatest of   all. By virtue of this position, she influences decisions on war   and peace in all corners of the globe. We can say, in fact, that,   because of this vast economic strength, she wields greater power   over war and peace than any other country on earth. All who yearn   for a lasting peace must therefore look to America for   help.    America helped – perhaps it would be more correct to say   compelled – Europe to create a League of Nations which would   provide a firm basis for peaceful coexistence among nations. It   was a crushing blow that America herself did not join this   organization, and without doubt her failure to do so contributed   largely to the failure of the League of Nations to live up to   expectations. We still see too much of the old rivalries of power   politics. Had the United States joined, she would have been a   natural mediator between many of the conflicting forces in   Europe, for America is more interested in peace in Europe than in   lending her support to any particular country.    It must be said, however, that the United States is not the power   for peace in the world that we should have wished her to be. She   has sometimes let herself drift into the imperialism which is the   natural outcome of industrial capitalism in our age. In many ways   she is typical of the wildest form of capitalist society, and   this has inevitably left its mark on American politics.    But America has at the same time fostered some of the most   spirited idealism on earth. It may be that this idealism derives   its vigor from the squalor and evil produced by social   conditions, in other words from the contrasts within itself. It   is certainly an undeniable fact, which must strike anyone who   knows the country, that the American nation has an instinctive   and profound faith in what the philosophers of 100 or 150 years   ago used to call human perfectability, the capacity to become   more and more perfect. It is a faith which has provided the   foundation for some of our greatest religions and one which has   inspired much of the best work for progress. It was proclaimed by   Jesus Christ; it inspired the work of men like Emerson and   Wergeland1. To the American mind   nothing is impossible. This attitude applies not only to science   and technology but to social forms and conditions as well. To an   American an ideal is not just a beautiful mirage but a practical   reality the implementation of which is every man’s duty. American   social idealism expresses itself as a burning desire to devote   work and life to the construction of a more equitable society, in   which men will show each other greater consideration in their   mutual relations, will provide stronger protection to the weak,   and will offer greater opportunities for the beneficent forces of   progress.    Two of the finest representatives of this American idealism are   awarded the Nobel Peace Prize today. Both have worked assiduously   and for many years to revive the ideal of peace and to rekindle   the spirit of peace in their own nation and in the whole of   mankind.    In honoring Jane Addams, we also pay tribute to the work which   women can do for peace and fraternity among nations. The old   concept implied that woman was the source of nearly all sin and   strife on earth. Popular tradition and poetry would also have it   that women were frequently the cause of the wars waged by kings   and nations. I know of only one legend to the contrary, the story   of the Sabine women who threw themselves between their Roman   fathers and brothers and their Sabine husbands.    In modern times the poets, starting with Goethe, Ibsen, and   Bjørnson   2, have seen women in a different light; in their eyes   women reflect the highest and purest moral standards of society.   And no man has placed greater faith in the work of women for the   cause of peace than did Bjørnson. It is this new position   acquired by women in the society of our time, their new   independence in relation to men, that gave us reason to   anticipate that they would constitute a new force in the work for   peace. Bjørnson seemed to see women as bringing «the   spirit of calm to the tumult of battle», with the prayer   that love should prevail over the passion to kill, and to believe   that when women obtained power in society and in the state, the   very spirit of war must die.    We must nevertheless acknowledge that women have not altogether   fulfilled the hopes we have placed in them. They have allowed too   much scope to the old morality of men, the morality of war. In   practical politics we have seen too little of that love, that   warm maternal feeling which renders murder and war so hateful to   every woman. But fortunately we have seen something of this   feminine will which revolts against war. Whenever women have   organized, they have always included the cause of peace in their   program. And Jane Addams combines all the best feminine qualities   which will help us to develop peace on earth.    Twice in my life, once more than twenty years ago and now again   this year, I have had the pleasure of visiting the institution   where she has been carrying on her lifework. In the poorest   districts of Chicago, among Polish, Italian, Mexican, and other   immigrants, she has established and maintained the vast social   organization centered in Hull-House3.   Here young and old alike, in fact all who ask, receive a helping   hand whether they wish to educate themselves or to find work.   When you meet Miss Addams here – be it in meeting room, workroom,   or dining room – you immediately become poignantly aware that she   has built a home and in it is a mother to one and   all. She is not one to talk much, but her quiet, greathearted   personality inspires confidence and creates an atmosphere of   goodwill which instinctively brings out the best in   everyone.    From this social work, often carried on among people of different   nationalities, it was for her only a natural step to the cause of   peace. She has now been its faithful spokesman for nearly a   quarter of a century. Little by little, through no attempt to   draw attention by her work but simply through the patient   self-sacrifice and quiet ardor which she devoted to it, she won   an eminent place in the love and esteem of her people. She became   the leading woman in the nation, one might almost say its leading   citizen. Consequently, the fact that she took a stand for the   ideal of peace was of special significance; since millions of men   and women looked up to her, she could give a new strength to that   ideal among the American people.    And when the need became more pressing than ever, she inspired   American women to work for peace on an international level. We   shall always remember as one of the finest and most promising   events during the last great war, the gathering of women from all   over the world, even from enemy countries, who met to discuss and   pursue common action for world peace. The initiative for this   conference, which took place at The Hague in April of 1915, came   from the Dutch women, and it is only right to pay tribute to the   memory of Dr. Aletta Jacobs4 who   stood at their head. But it was natural that they should ask Miss   Addams to come to preside over their conference. From the moment   the war broke out, she had launched a propaganda campaign, with   the aim of uniting America and the other neutral countries to end   the war, and had succeeded in forming a great organization of   women to support this program. So it was that she energetically   opposed the entry of the United States into the war. She held   fast to the ideal of peace even during the difficult hours when   other considerations and interests obscured it from her   compatriots and drove them into the conflict. Throughout the   whole war she toiled for a peace that would not engender a new   war, becoming, as she did so, the spokesman for the pacifist   women of the world. Sometimes her views were at odds with public   opinion both at home and abroad. But she never gave in, and in   the end she regained the place of honor she had had before in the   hearts of her people. Devotion to a cause always inspires   respect, and in her devotion Miss Addams is truly American. This   very year she joined with representatives of countries all over   the world to call for general disarmament.    In Nicholas Murray Butler, president of the great Columbia   University in New York, the Nobel Committee sees a man who   shares the qualities of Jane Addams. His work for peace began at   about the same time as hers, some twenty-five years ago, and it   has been distinguished by tireless energy and a zeal almost   without parallel. He is one of those men who give themselves   completely to anything they undertake, always ready, always   willing. Nothing can discourage him or sap his strength. Nothing   can disturb the serene smile in his eyes. And his personality is   infectious, for he communicates courage, vigor, and confidence to   all who work with him. He has a great talent for putting others   to work and for finding the right job for the right man. If there   be a man who can truly be called American, then Butler is that   man: a greathearted worker and a splendid organizer. I have   watched him at work at his university and I have seen him preside   over a peace conference – wherever he goes, an aura of vitality   seems to follow him.    It was another winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Frenchman   d’Estournelles de Constant, who   drew him into the work for peace and who first oriented his   efforts. In 1907 he was elected president of the American branch   of the Conciliation internationale which d’Estournelles himself   had founded. While d’Estournelles’ chief aim had been   reconciliation between France and Germany and between France and   England, Butler adopted a much wider program, and, as a result,   the American branch rapidly became the most important in the   whole organization.    In my opinion it would be difficult to name another peace   organization which has persisted in such effective, tenacious,   and steady work for the cause of peace as has this American group   under the presidency of Butler. With typically American practical   common sense, he saw the need to establish this work on a sound   economic footing, and it was primarily his influence that   prompted Carnegie to establish the very substantial   Endowment for   International Peace in 19105.   Butler himself became president of one of its sections, that   concerned with «intercourse and education», which he   finally linked to the American branch of the Conciliation   internationale, and later he became head of the Endowment itself.   But throughout these years, the kind of work he did remained   basically the same.    We can see at once that all this activity has been directed by a   man of great knowledge and wide views. He has not confined   himself merely to empty generalities but, on the contrary, has   raised all the questions which might imperil international peace.   He has had experts sent to examine potential causes of war in the   Balkans, the Far East, and Mexico, and so has succeeded in   compiling invaluable reports on a number of political danger   spots. His main concern has always been the gathering of   information on all kinds of international conditions and   relationships, and his great ambition has been to create an   «international mind», the will and the ability to   examine every question from an international point of view which   never forgets that in any dispute each of the two combatants may   have his justification and consequently the right to a fair   hearing. He himself has never failed in this obligation, and he   has done more than most to draw attention to such a duty in all   parts of the world.    It is also worthy of mention that on one occasion four or five   years ago he intervened in an actual situation, securing results   that delighted many friends of peace. When Brind made his famous speech in April,   1927, proposing that France and the United States should agree to   outlaw war, his appeal found no response in America until Butler   took it up and successfully rallied public opinion to it. He   himself had discussed the matter with Briand beforehand, and the   work he then did6 drew America   into the negotiations which, in the following year, resulted in   what we know as the Kellogg Pact. People may hold differing   opinions as to the practical effect of this pact, but it is at   least a living proof of the development of the peace idea. It was   no more than a just recognition that Briand should send   particular words of thanks to Butler on the day the pact was   signed. And it is only natural that in addition to Briand   himself, two other Nobel Peace Prize winners, Sir Austen Chamberlain and Elihu Root, should have strongly   supported Butler’s candidacy for this year’s prize.    In the case of peace workers such as Butler and Jane Addams, it   is often difficult to point to tangible and manifest results of   their actions or to particular events in political life with   which their names may be associated. Those who set their sights   on awakening and educating public opinion cannot expect swift   victories of the kind that win popular acclaim. Consequently, it   has come about – and perhaps had to come about – that the Peace   Prizes have passed over such patient pioneers as these and have   gone to statesmen holding governmental positions of authority who   had the power to transform efforts for peace into treaties and   other political measures.    But a statesman and the policies he represents reflect the social   and intellectual conditions of his country. If his work is to   endure, it must have a solidly developed foundation. Enterprises   for peace such as the League of Nations, the Locarno Treaty, or   the Kellogg Pact would have been impossible if they had not been   backed by a desire and will for peace on the part of powerful   sections of the people in all countries.    Certainly, there are profound forces which shape the progress of   society and of the state, forces which inevitably affect what we   call peace policy. New interests and new ideals are born which   direct nations toward new forms of organization. The idea of   international peace and justice can perhaps never attain ultimate   victory until our entire society is reconstructed upon a new   foundation. Such is the context of progress in all fields of   society.    But any new idea which grows and prospers always needs men who   can give it a clear and conscious form. Nothing in society ever   moves forward of its own momentum; progress must always be   sustained by the human thought, human will, and human action to   transmute the need into a living social form. We should therefore   recognize as a great historic mission the work of all those who   help us to see the goal which, willingly or unwillingly, we   should make our own, all those who help to unite popular thought   and public will in positive action for social reconstruction.   With every specific idea that they implant in the popular will,   they take us another step along the road to the new   society.    It is to two such people that we now pay tribute. A long labor,   rich in sacrifice offered in the cause of peace, is today honored   by the Nobel Prize. Miss Addams and President Butler belong to   those who have brought the ideals of peace to life in thousands   and thousands of people. They have taught large sections of the   population to demand peace from their leaders. They have created   forces which will stimulate progress, and all those who aspire to   a peaceful society on earth are deeply in their debt.    1.

"17","1933","Sir Norman Angell"," In the work for international peace, as in   other fields of human endeavor, there must be a division of   labor; among others, a division of labor between technicians and   educators.    Mr. Arthur Henderson is one of   the technicians, a statesman devising plans for peace and leading   the way for their acceptance. Norman Angell, the recipient of the   Nobel Peace Prize for 1933, is one of the educators, one of those   who instruct public opinion, who pave the way for reforms which   the statesmen attempt to carry out. His share in this educational   task has been original and influential.    Ralph Norman Angell Lane is a farmer’s son from Norfolk who will   be sixty years old next Boxing Day1. His health was never strong and in his   youth he lived several years in California. Thus he established   contacts with the United States and with American public opinion   which he has kept up throughout life. He became a journalist, and   when first I met him – now more than twenty years ago – he was   the business manager of the Paris edition of the Daily   Mail and had been living in France for some years. His   intimate knowledge of public opinion in three of the big powers   of the world has qualified him superbly for his chosen   work.    I remember that he was rather insistent on the point that he was   not on the editorial staff of that jingo-paper. He explained to   me that his job was to buy paper and printer’s ink for it. But,   he added with a little smile, he was on very good terms with the   newspaper king, Lord Northcliffe2, «and thus I can manage when occasion   offers to get some sensible stuff into his papers».    Norman Angell was then already a famous writer. His first book,   Patriotism under Three Flags3, which appeared in 1903 and which discussed   problems rising out of the South African War, had passed quite   unnoticed. Then in 1909, he published a little book of some   hundred pages, Europe’s Optical Illusion4, and he awoke one morning to find himself   famous.    A book’s success is more often than not a haphazard thing. Norman   Angell’s book fell into the hands of Lord Esher, a high court   official and a personal friend of King Edward5. And Lord Esher saw to it that this book   became known. Edition followed edition, and in the following year   of 1910, Norman Angell published a new, partly revised, and   considerably expanded edition entitled The Great Illusion,   which appeared in tens, if not hundreds, of thousands and was   translated into twenty-five foreign languages.    What was still more remarkable, Lord Esher’s discreet but   efficient propaganda also won over a wealthy man to Norman   Angell’s ideas. He was persuaded to donate a large sum of money   to the Garton Foundation, so named for the donor6, with the objective of making Norman   Angell’s ideas known through research, lectures, and   publications.    What is the «Greet Illusion» which Norman Angell wishes   to explode?    In few – and therefore insufficient – words, it is this: war is a   quite inadequate method for solving international disputes; war   does not carry any advantage, not even to the victors, least of   all any economic advantage. This thesis the author supports by   applying some representative tests: If war – a victorious war –   were economically advantageous, then the citizens of those big   powers which have built their world empires through victorious   wars would be better off than the citizens of small pacific   nations. Statistics of capital and revenues in these two   categories of nations furnish proof that this is not so. Dutch   stocks and Swedish, Swiss stocks and Norwegian, stand higher on   the world’s exchanges than those of Great Britain, of France, of   Germany, not to mention those of czarist Russia.    Does war increase trade, asks Norman Angell, and his answer is:   in a world of division of labor, the products constitute wealth   only if you can get rid of them. War which impoverishes your   clients in the victorious as well as in the defeated nation, war   which hinders if it does not strangle trade tends to make   merchandise valueless; at any rate it takes away the   profit.    Most convincing of all is the sixth chapter of the book, entitled   «The Indemnity Futility».    Here I want to make a little jump in my chronology. Last year,   twenty-four years after the first edition of his book, Norman   Angell made an exceptional experiment. He reedited his book of   1910, adding an introduction and a postscript. Nearly sixty years   old he subjected the work of his youth to his own revision and   judgment. Some chapters he rewrote – not to modify them but to   summarize and bring them up to date.    But there was one chapter which was printed, word for word, as in   1910. It was this sixth chapter «The Indemnity   Futility». Norman Angell tells us that when the book was   published for the first time, part of his contention – in fact,   the entire basic theory of this chapter – was made the object of   severe criticism; indeed, it had been rejected entirely by both   an English and a French economist. Their criticism had shaken his   belief in his own theories enough to make him qualify his   assertions in later editions.    Now – after we have experienced what Mr. Keynes has called The   Economic Consequences of the Peace7 – Norman Angell thinks that he can reprint,   word for word, what he said in 1910; namely, that it is futile to   impose a war indemnity. Such indemnity is simply unpayable unless   the creditor nation is willing to receive it in the form of   imports, and against this form of payment citizens will raise   violent protest, calling it «dumping», «unfair   competition», a violation of the very principles of the   protectionist duties imposed for their benefit.    The tragedy – or tragicomedy – of «reparations» has   proved the validity of Norman Angell’s views. He had based his   argument on the consequences so tragic for the economy of   victorious Germany-of the five milliard gold francs war indemnity   paid by France after the Franco-German war of 1870-1871. His   argument was rejected by the experts. Now the illusion bubble of   the 225 milliard gold marks indemnity to be paid by Germany has   burst before our very eyes. Now we all think Norman Angell quite   right. He states it coolly without scorn or haughtiness, just   with a somewhat tired, disillusioned smile on his pale   face.    I take up my chronological thread and return to the first edition   of his chief work.    The Great Illusion in its turn created certain illusions   in those who read the book superficially (or who only heard about   it). Because Norman Angell had proved war to be foolish, to be a   bad business proposition, many believed that he had said there   would be no more war in Europe. Against this misinterpretation   Norman Angell at once protested with the greatest heat. He asked:   «Why then do I pursue my fight against war?» Indeed,   why should pacifists continue their frequently thankless and   unpopular work if they believe that war will never occur any   more? Rational people do not try to break down an open   door.    The final chapter of The Great Illusion presents a   convincing plea for a change in foreign policy from that of a war   policy to one of international cooperation and peace. If this is   not made, war, he says, will be inevitable. The fact that we are   living in a world of international interdependence makes it   imperative that we organize the international community of   nations accordingly, basing the community on the common interests   which bind nations together, relinquishing the principle of   isolated national defence, providing collective security through   common effort by erecting an international authority which can   replace the prevailing international anarchy.    Norman Angell is a great writer and journalist. He possesses the   greatest gift of the pamphleteer, the gift of saying the same   thing again and again, but in new ways, with new and apt   illustrations. He has been compared with Swift and with   Cobden8 . That is high praise,   but well-deserved praise. He is fundamentally different from both   of them. He does not have Swift’s cutting contempt. Nor has he   Cobden’s persuasive and magnetic eloquence, which drew tens of   thousands to his meetings and carried the cause of free trade to   victory in less than a generation, both in England and in Europe   – alas, for all too short a time.    Norman Angell towers as high as Swift or Cobden. But his is   another kind of genius; he is not a poet as was Swift, nor a   preacher as was Cobden. Norman Angell speaks to the intellect. He   is cool and clear. He has a profound belief in reason and in   rationalism. He is convinced that at long last reason will   prevail when we succeed in sweeping away the mists of illusion   and intellectual error.    It is this belief which supported him through the World War,   through the reparations tragedy, and through the bitter postwar   disappointments.    And he has had the courage of his convictions. Immediately after   the outbreak of the World War, he founded – with E. D. Morel,   Ramsay MacDonald, Charles Trevelyan, and Arthur Ponsonby – the   Union of Democratic Control9 ,   the first plank of whose platform was the introduction of public   and parliamentary control of foreign policy in constitutional   practice. He and his comrades believed in the educative influence   of public discussion. Thus could the mists of illusion be   dissipated.    In his book of 1915, Prussianism and Its Destruction, he   demonstrated that war was inefficient as a means of eradicating   human error. You cannot kill ideas with bullets. And he showed   that «Prussianism» – militarism – was not a phenomenon   indigenous to Germany only. Of course he was denounced as   pro-German, as were his colleagues.    Norman Angell also traveled widely in the United States, giving   lectures and leading study groups, all the while fighting for his   ideas. He came into close contact with President Wilson and had a share in the   development of Wilson’s plan for a League of Nations.    After the war he criticized the peace settlement, particularly   its economic stipulations. From 1929 to 1931 he sat in the House   of Commons as a member of the Labor Party behind Mr. Henderson.   In the last few years, in books and lectures he has concentrated   his efforts on attempts to clarify certain problems of social   psychology. In his Unseen Assassins (1932) he unmasks the   prejudices and the misconceptions in the human mind on which   selfish interests and ambitious politicians can play in order to   lead the people to the perilous paths of the policy of force and   war. I should like also to mention two chapters he wrote last   year for a book I have seen in bookstore windows here in Oslo,   The Intelligent Man’s Way to the Prevention of   War10.    It is mankind’s deep tragedy that it so rarely sees reality. We   all have in our eyes «the splint of the goblin looking   glass» (as Sigrid Undset has   called one of her books)11. We   see what we desire to see, not naked reality. Or we have before   our eyes mists, stereotypes inherited from our parents, from our   grandparents, even from our great-grandparents. Intellectually we   are wearing the cast-off clothes of our ancestors, and we do not   see, we do not understand that they no longer fit us.    And our statesmen, who of necessity are obliged to work with the   material which the people through «public opinion»   offer them, toil in the same mist, in the same cast-off clothing,   though to be just, many of them taken individually have their   eyes open above the mists.    Time and again Norman Angell returns to this metaphor – «the   mist». We read on the first page of the last edition of   The Great Illusion: «This book endeavors to clear   away the mists which prevent so many from seeing the   road.»    Few people, if any, have done as much as Sir Norman to remove   «the splint of the goblin looking glass» in our eyes,   to clear away the mists which prevent us from seeing the road we   should travel. He has done it, and he goes on doing it, because   he has a profound and warm belief in what he calls in one of his   books «the potential rationalism of mankind».    Let us hope that his optimism may be vindicated.    1. «Boxing Day» in   England, the first weekday after Christmas, gets its name   from the practice of giving Christmas «boxes» or gifts   to postmen, etc. Ralph Norman Angell Lane, born on December 26,   1872, used the shortened version of his name for the first time   as the author of The Great Illusion.    2.

"18","1934","Arthur Henderson"," It is not my task today to present a   biography of our guest and friend Mr. Arthur Henderson. In this   respect I shall be very brief.    As a member of the House of Commons since 1903 – with very few   interruptions – he has for more than thirty years belonged to the   political life of Great Britain. In the first place, his   political activity has been connected with the British Labor   Party, the progress of which he has not only followed, but to   which he has contributed significantly. He was parliamentary   leader of the Labor group from 1908 to 1910 and from 1914 to   1917. And for many years, until recently when at his own desire   he was replaced, he was secretary-general of his party. It may   safely be said that politically he is deeply rooted in the labor   movement, and he has always represented the broad principal views   of his party, whose confidence he has possessed in a remarkable   degree.    Our interest in the man of the day takes us, however, from the   part played by domestic politics in his life and work to that   taken by foreign politics.    Like those in his own party – and even many other British   politicians – he looked with skepticism upon the line followed in   foreign politics which led to the division of Europe into two   armed camps and which at last drove docile nations into the world   catastrophe of 1914 – the war of Pontius Pilate, as Theodor Wolff   calls it in his recent work1,   because all the statesmen of Europe have tried to wash their   hands of the black stain of responsibility. What a tremendous   impression the outbreak of war at that time made even on the   leaders is shown by Sir Edward Grey2, who, when his praiseworthy efforts to bring   about negotiations at the eleventh hour failed, in desperation   smote his writing desk with both fists and exclaimed: «I   hate the war.»    Since the urgency of the war compelled all British groups to   unite for the protection of the home country and the empire, we   find Arthur Henderson a member first in Mr. Asquith’s coalition   government in 1915 and later in Mr. Lloyd George’s war cabinet,   which, however, he left in 19173.   And this withdrawal from Mr. Lloyd George’s cabinet was   symptomatic. It was the will of peace, the desire for peace in   him which now found expression. He parted company because the   government would not allow the British Labor Party to send   representatives to the big Socialist Conference in Stockholm to   which Mr. Branting4 had invited friends and enemies.    Undoubtedly, his thought and his view at that time coincided with   what a man, whom I know he rates very highly, the well-known   editor of the Manchester Guardian, Mr. C. P.   Scott5, wrote as early as 1916:   «I hate the very thought of the permanent division and   hostility in Europe and if that is all we have to look forward   to, I feel as if the future has little interest for me and I had   rather get out of it. It isn’t the material loss or even the   prospect necessarily involved of future wars and bloodshed; it is   the enthronement in Europe – that is, practically in the   civilized world – of the spirit of hatred and   revenge.»    The war bled to an end after four years of untold suffering,   losses, and destruction. At last we got peace, a peace which was   supposed to «end the last war», but which unfortunately   bore more the impress of the spirit which the same Mr. Scott   described in 19186: «Let   there be no mistake. Chauvinism is not dead, imperialism is not   dead in any of the great European countries.»    Since those days when the peace was signed and until today, the   world has felt the heavy weight of the consequences of that   peace. In financial and commercial policy sound development has   stopped, and natural connections between countries are obstructed   by countless restrictions, prohibitions, and exchange   difficulties. And politically the new era has taken the shape of   increasing mutual distrust, uncertainty, and fear.    As an institutional counterbalance to this dark side of the peace   and as a means of achieving better times stands the League of   Nations. It is our only consolation, our best hope. Its   organization and its influence, the possibilities for   understanding which it can and does bring to all, make the League   of Nations the bulwark from which the attack for happier times of   reconciliation and peace may be launched.    And among the bravest and most faithful on this bulwark we find   Arthur Henderson.    In Mr. MacDonald’s7 first   cabinet, from 1924 to 1925, Arthur Henderson sat as home   secretary. But it was also in 1924 that he became a delegate to   the Assembly of the League of Nations, sat on the Committee of   Security and Disarmament, and was elected a member of the   Committee of Twelve which drafted the protocol on these   questions. And here he took a firm stand, declaring that   disarmament must be effected before decisions on security and   sanctions could be carried out.    Arthur Henderson became foreign secretary in MacDonald’s second   cabinet in 1929, and his authority, his influence, his   opportunities for effective action were naturally increased.   During these years he invariably appeared personally as first   delegate of Great Britain at both the Assembly and the Council   meetings of the League where his desire and determination to do   something positive was very marked.    So when in May, 1931, he was appointed president of the great   Disarmament Conference, all those who hoped for and believed in   positive results from this conference considered it a strong   guarantee that above all others he, the foreign secretary of   powerful Britain, had been chosen for this important post.    In the autumn of 1931, however, MacDonald’s government fell, and   Arthur Henderson was for several years out of British politics.   But his personal reputation was so high, and faith and confidence   in him so great that a strong and universal demand kept him in   his post as president of the Disarmament Conference.    The world has watched him work in this capacity throughout these   difficult years, witnessing his untiring struggle and his   courageous efforts.    His political position, of course, had been weakened by the fall   of the government. He was president of the Disarmament   Conference, but not even a member of the delegation which his own   country sent to the conference.    There he stands, in the struggle and in the work itself, a lonely   man. The words of Bjørnson to   Émile Zola during his fight for justice in the Dreyfus   case8 come to mind: «A   single man against millions – the proudest sight to be   seen.»    As president of the Disarmament Conference, Arthur Henderson   exhibits his best qualities: tact and unfailing courtesy, prudent   reserve, and at the same time the faculty of taking decisive   action when necessary. He has indestructible endurance and a   never ending patience. Despite indifferent health, despite   adversity and disappointments, he never tires. Not only during   the sessions but even between sessions, he keeps in contact with   the various governments and with world opinion.    Not many would have been able to hold out so long; not many would   even have been strong enough, and still fewer would have   possessed the necessary authority. If the Conference is still   alive and if there is still a thin thread of hope, it is   primarily because of Mr. Arthur Henderson.    But is the Conference alive, is there still   hope?    The fair words and promises of the Treaty of Peace and of the   Covenant of the League of Nations seem to be of scarcely greater   importance than those of that «scrap of paper» of which   we once heard so much9, and   meanwhile the Naval Convention10   and other conventions fall to pieces.    The feeling of unease and desolation increases while rumors that   even Germany is arming are broadcast to millions of anxious   listeners.    The words «Let it be the last war» and «Lest we   forget» belong to the era of twenty years ago, and the men   who today hold the fate of the world in their hands may perhaps   one day find themselves also in the position of Pontius   Pilate.    «Germany is arming» – Well! In the divine comedy by our   immortal Ludvig Holberg about the unhappy Jeppe11, we find this sentence: «Everybody   says that Jeppe drinks, but nobody asks why Jeppe   drinks.»    Let us all who now complain that Germany also is arming look into   our own consciences and ask why Germany is arming. In the debate   in the British House of Commons a few days ago Mr.   Baldwin12 said on this subject:   «I hope and believe that this debate, inaugurated not   perhaps with those ideas but with a genuine and rightful desire   to get to know the truth in Europe, may have greater consequences   and better consequences than any of us could have thought. It may   be that an opportunity has been made for a first step once more   to bring together the nations of Europe, and it may be that,   having learned some wisdom by the deterioration and the   degeneration of the conditions of Europe in the last few years,   the voice of wisdom and the voice of peace may   prevail.»    All who spoke in the House of Commons agreed that the only means   of creating peace in Europe and security for every single nation   is the limitation of armaments and that Germany must share in   that work.    General Smuts said in his great speech the other day on   «British Policy Today» that to achieve this «there   is only one way, and that is to recognize Germany’s complete   equality of status with her fellows and to do so frankly, freely,   and unreservedly.»13    Yes, that is just where the road lies which may bring new life   and fresh hope to the Disarmament Conference, the road which   leads out of the deadlock, which leads forward, the road of   understanding and of peace – Arthur Henderson’s road.    There is no better, there is no other.    On Briand‘s coffin, as a tribute   from the heart and as a token of gratitude to him who died in the   struggle for international peace and understanding, a woman laid   a small bunch of spring violets, with a slip of paper on which   were written these touching words: «From a mother who has   lost much, but who still has a son aged eighteen».    Lest our world, our community, our civilization, our future, our   children perish in a new Armageddon, every one of us must today   remember the violets of this mother. Maternal love and manhood     unite to secure peace:     Throw down the weapons-step aside,     you angryfools: Bring us bread,     help us end our common dread,     help us love each other. It is in these hard times when the freedom   of peoples is threatened, when free speech and free thought are   gagged, when force violates justice, that, in the holy name of   freedom, peace, and understanding between peoples, we bring our   thanks and our homage to the man who stands firm and faithful,   believing in the truth of the words of Bjørnstjerne   Bjørnson: «The thought of peace is the greatest thought   in the world. By it human progress shall be tested and around it   all efforts for freedom shall rally for the last great   struggle.» After receiving his diploma and medal, Mr. Henderson responded to   the presentation, saying in part14: «You were good enough to make   special mention, Mr. Prime Minister, of the Disarmament   Conference. You asked: ‹Is the Conference alive? is there   still hope?› It would be a sad day, not only for us here   but for the great masses of humble citizens in all lands, if that   question had to be answered in the negative. As you have stated,   Mr. Prime Minister, I have devoted nearly three years to the work   of the Disarmament Conference. It has been a period of anxious   and exacting labors for all – a period of difficulty and delay   and disappointments – of hopes deferred. But if success has yet   to be achieved, at least that decisive and heart-breaking word   ‹failure› has not been written. And I cannot conceive   that it will be allowed to be written.»    1.

"19","1935","Carl von Ossietzky"," Carl von Ossietzky, who has been awarded   the Peace Prize for 1935, belongs to no political party. He is   not a Communist; he is not in any sense a conservative. Indeed,   one cannot easily pin on him any of the usual political tags. If   I were asked to give my impression of his personality, I should   say that he seems to me to be a liberal or, if you prefer, a   liberal of the old school. In using this description I do not   have in mind economic liberalism, but liberalism in a completely   different sense; a burning love for freedom of thought and   expression; a firm belief in free competition in all spiritual   fields; a broad international outlook; a respect for values   created by other nations – and all of these dominated by the   theme of peace.    An account of Ossietzky’s life is to be found in all the   newspapers, and I shall not weary you by needless   repetition.    He served in the war as an ordinary soldier. But the war had the   effect of maturing and crystallizing the pacifist ideas which he   had already cherished for a long time. When the war ended, he   threw himself into work for peace. In Germany he was among those   who formed the movement which took as its slogan: «No more   war». He became secretary of the German Peace   Society1, the president of which   was Mr. Quidde,   who was himself subsequently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.   Office work, however, failed to satisfy Ossietzky. He saw his   true vocation as being in journalism. And so, leaving his job as   secretary, he cast himself into the fray, applying his talents to   the public platform as well as to newspapers and   periodicals.    We are told that he is a gifted orator. The role in which he is   best known, however, is that of journalist and essayist. He is an   author of note; his style is supple, elegant, often bitingly   witty. He covers a large field, writing about all aspects of   modern politics, but his thought is focused above all on the   cause of peace. His favorite weapon is the rapier. The sudden   thrust, the lightning parry – these characterize his style. And   in truth there is in him something of the knight, a quality which   those who know him have remarked upon.    And yet we cannot today obtain a true impression of his merit and   importance as a journalist simply by reading the articles he has   written in the past. The work of the journalist is akin to that   of the stage artist in that it lives in the present and cannot be   re-created. The sum total of a journalist’s work does not reside   in the faded print which you can, if you care to take the   trouble, seek out and read. The sum total of the journalist’s   craft, like that of the stage artist, lies in the impact it makes   on the minds of others at the time. The truly great actor lives   on in our minds, a vivid memory to the end of our days, a legend   to be passed on to younger generations. It is somewhat the same   with the journalist. We can browse through an old newspaper and   read of events with which we were once well acquainted, and the   words can still evoke some of that nervous tension, that vitality   and warmth with which they were charged when cast into the   maelstrom of the moment. But the spark of life is lost, for the   words belong to their own day.    But balancing this we have the full force of the testimony of   those who followed him in his fight and who were inspired by it.   The sources of such testimony are so varied and their number so   great that I cannot enumerate them here. Let me point to only one   noteworthy fact: no less than six previous recipients of the   Nobel Peace Prize have lent their support to Ossietzky’s   candidacy for the award.    But, many people ask, has Ossietzky really contributed so much to   peace? Has he not become a symbol of the struggle for peace   rather than its champion?    In my opinion this is not so. But even if it were, how great is   the significance of the symbol in our life! In religion, in   politics, in public affairs, in peace and war, we rally round   symbols. We understand the power they hold over us. Moreover, as   a rallying point, a symbol may well be preferable to a   personality. Men can all too often be compared to the   «hulder», the wicked Norwegian fairy, beautiful when   looked at from the front, but hollow in the back. Such is not the   case with the symbol because the symbol is born of an idea and is   the bearer of an idea. It exists through the idea which first   created it and reflects it faithfully and without   distortion.    We have among our poems a few lines about a symbol, lines which   are quoted more and more frequently: For that is the great thing and the sublime     thing,     that the banner may wave, though the man has to die. The symbol certainly has its value. But   Ossietzky is not just a symbol. He is something quite different   and something much more. He is a deed; and he is a man.    It is on these grounds that Ossietzky has been awarded the Nobel   Peace Prize, and on these grounds alone. His candidacy was   examined in the same manner as that of all others, and the   decision was reached according to the same principles. If we look   back upon all the men and women who have received the Peace Prize   over the years, we find that they are of widely divergent   personalities and views and that the lives of many of them were   marked by passion, grief, and struggle. It is quite obvious that   the Nobel Committee, in awarding the prize to these different   personalities, has neither shared all the opinions which they   held nor declared its solidarity with all of their work. The wish   of the Nobel Committee has always been to fulfill its task and   its obligation, namely, to reward work for peace – that and   nothing else. And the Nobel Committee has been able to do so   because it is totally independent. It is not answerable to   anyone, nor do its decisions commit anyone other than   itself.    In awarding this year’s Nobel Peace Prize to Carl von Ossietzky   we are therefore recognizing his valuable contribution to the   cause of peace – nothing more, and certainly nothing less.    1.

"20","1936","Carlos Saavedra Lamas"," The Nobel Peace Prize for 1936 has been   awarded to Mr. Carlos Saavedra Lamas, foreign minister of the   Argentine Republic. The prize has thus been given to a   statesman.    The career and achievements of a statesman must always be   examined in the context of his milieu and time; and doing so in   depth is the Nobel Committee’s task when it evaluates a   statesman’s personal contribution to the cause of peace. A few   words concerning the milieu in which Saavedra Lamas has worked   will therefore not be out of place.    Saavedra Lamas’ country, Argentina, occupies a leading position   in Latin America, a part of the world whose characteristics   distinguish it in important respects from the European part where   we live. For most of Latin America, Spanish is the common tongue,   and the Roman Catholic faith the common religion. The Latin   American nations are also united by a political bond, for all   twenty have for a long time enjoyed a republican form of   government, differing in this fundamental regard from the old   Europe of before the World War.    Latin America has accordingly been spared many of the problems   which have beset us here. It does not suffer from the problem of   nationalism, nor is there racial conflict with the indigenous   Indian population, its absence being largely due to the influence   and example of the Catholic missionaries who approached the   so-called «primitive» peoples in a spirit of   understanding.    Finally – and this is by no means least important – Latin America   is not, like Europe, burdened by the problem of overpopulation,   for there is plenty of space in that young world. Along with   Finland, our own country is the least densely populated in   Europe. Only one of South America’s ten countries, Uruguay, is   more heavily peopled than Norway and Finland, and even Uruguay   has a density of population well below that of Sweden. The   consequence is that frontier disputes in South America never   become as acute as they do in Europe. In fact, no other part of   the world can boast such amicable settlement of boundary disputes   – very often achieved by arbitration. Indeed, during the   nineteenth century, Latin America became established as the home   of arbitration.    In their struggle to free themselves from Spanish domination, the   Latin American states had the support of their great sister   republic in the North, the United States. President   Monroe in 1823 made his famous declaration that the United   States would not permit any part of American territory to be   colonized by a European state1.   This declaration was respected, and America thus escaped the fate   which overtook Africa and to a certain extent Asia, both of which   became the scenes of imperialist struggles between rival European   powers.    The idea of a federation, or at least of organized cooperation   between the American republics, soon arose. Simón   Bólivar, the Liberator, was a staunch supporter of this   idea, and a number of proposals and attempts to form such an   association are recorded in the annals of history2. One finally began to take shape in 1889,   when United States Secretary of State James G.   Blaine3 called a Pan-American   Conference in Washington4, the   first of a series which have since taken place at irregular   intervals. The eighth conference opened last week in the capital   of Argentina, under the presidency of Carlos Saavedra Lamas. With   the passage of time, the conferences have built up an   organization which is becoming more closely knit. The Pan   American Union has its offices in Washington. It has studied a   number of questions of common interest to the American states;   among them, public health, the laws relating to intellectual   property, and communications – including the construction of a   Pan-American railway which will link all countries in America   from South to North. The Union has also taken a constant interest   in matters pertaining to laws for peace, such as the development   of international conciliation and arbitration.    In its efforts to create solidarity, the Union from the very   beginning faced a serious problem: the relations between the   powerful North American republic on the one hand and the Latin   American republics on the other. The latter suspected that the   Pan American Union was merely a convenient cover for the   imperialist tendencies of the statesmen in Washington. Blaine   himself, the originator of the Union, was in the vanguard of   North American imperialism, a policy which was subsequently   pursued with particular vigor in the Caribbean. The most   pronounced representative of this North American imperialism,   Theodore Roosevelt, interpreted   Monroe’s declaration of 1823 as conferring a right on the United   States to see to it that the other states of the Western   Hemisphere maintained a well-ordered government which would   afford security to the North American business men in their   economic ventures and financial investments in these countries.   From the Monroe declaration he had extrapolated a Monroe   Doctrine which constituted a potential danger to the   independence of these states.    This interpretation drew sharp opposition from the Latin American   countries, and Argentina, Saavedra Lamas’ homeland and one of   Latin America’s most powerful and best organized states, became   the leader in the fight against intervention.    It is against this background that we must look at the work of   Saavedra Lamas.    He began his career as a university professor and from the   university he went into politics. In his most important academic   work, which has appeared in French, La Crise de la   codification et la doctrine argentine de droit international,   he mounts a vigorous attack against the policy of intervention,   and especially against that form of it which, in his opinion, had   been conceived and practiced by the United States. The change in   U.S. policy during recent years, at first introduced in a mild   form under President Hoover and now pursued obviously and   consistently under Franklin Roosevelt5,   must be a source of great satisfaction to Saavedra Lamas. This   change has led him to play a more active part in the work of the   Pan American Union, which is no longer suspected of being merely   a camouflage for North American imperialism.    I shall not linger over the academic work of Saavedra Lamas, for   it is in the political field that he has made his most valuable   contribution. He entered political life at a very early age. He   was scarcely thirty years old when he was elected a member of   Parliament, and by 1917 he was already minister of Justice and   Education. As you know, Argentina remained neutral during the   World War; unlike most of the Latin American countries, it did   not follow the United States into the conflict. Nevertheless, it   was invited, along with twelve other neutral countries in Europe,   Asia, and America, to join the League of Nations, and at the   First Assembly in 1920, it took a highly distinctive position.   The Argentine delegates asked that the League Covenant be amended   to admit any nation to membership without prior application and   without such admission’s being subject to a vote. When this   proposal was not adopted at once and received no support at all,   Argentina withdrew from the Assembly, its seat there remaining   vacant for many years to come.    Nevertheless, Argentina continued to send representatives to the   International Labor Conferences6,   and in 1928 we find Saavedra Lamas not only heading his country’s   delegation but also being elected president of the conference. In   this capacity, he had reason to study the institutions of Geneva   in some detail, and so acquired useful preparation for the active   part he was to play in international peace politics after   February, 1932, when he became Argentina’s foreign minister, an   office which he still holds.    Some months after he had taken up his new ministerial   appointment, a bitter war broke out between Argentina’s   neighbors, Bolivia and Paraguay7.   This war has constantly claimed his attention. He deployed his   efforts in three different but converging directions. He was   learned in international law; he was acquainted, through some   firsthand experience, with the existing international   organizations, the League of Nations and the Pan American Union;   and he was familiar with the particular position maintained by   the United States on questions of war and peace. So he made a   comprehensive attempt to coordinate these three different   factors.    Like the logically thinking «Latin» he is, he began by   formulating a theoretical expression of his ideas, working out   his Antiwar Pact during his very first year as foreign   minister.    Its first two articles express, in slightly modified form, the   same principles of international law for which the United States   has tried to gain recognition: first, the condemnation of all   forms of aggressive war – the central point of the Kellogg-Briand   Pact 8; and second, the refusal   to recognize any territorial expansion or change of boundary   unless effected by peaceful means – the so-called «Stimson   Doctrine», which, un der President Hoover, Secretary of   State Henry L. Stimson had formulated during the Manchurian   conflict in 19329, and which was   afterwards endorsed in the special session of the League of   Nations Assembly called as a result of that dispute.    Thus did Saavedra Lamas seek to secure the invaluable support of   the United States for his pact.    Both the Kellogg Pact and the Stimson Doctrine are simply   declarations; that is to say, of purely theoretical nature.   Saavedra Lamas’ Antiwar Pact goes further: its Article 3 requires   the states not involved in a given conflict, in which one or more   states violate the obligations stipulated in Articles 1 and 2, to   maintain «a common and united attitude» and to employ   the political, legal, and economic means provided by   international law to put an end to the conflict; they shall have   recourse to the influence of public opinion but shall never   resort to intervention, either diplomatic or armed, subject to   any commitments they may have assumed under other agreements.   This last reservation clearly refers to sanctions stipulated by   the League of Nations Covenant. Article 4 outlines a conciliation   procedure which all signatory nations undertake to follow in   settling the dispute.    The Antiwar Pact, therefore, tries to steer a middle course   between the system of the Kellogg Pact and the Stimson Doctrine,   which is satisfied to enunciate principles, and the far more   rigid system laid down in the League of Nations Covenant. The   pact rejects neither system, but opens the way to collaboration   between those nations which so far have preferred the first   system – especially the United States – and the states which have   favored the second – the member states of the League of   Nations.    His efforts to secure acceptance of his pact have proved Saavedra   Lamas to be an astute and farsighted diplomat. He first obtained   the signatures of six Latin American states at a solemn ceremony   which he shrewdly arranged in Rio de Janeiro on October 10, 1933.   By this step he won the powerful support of Brazil, the largest   of the South American states, which had quit the League of   Nations ten years before. Two months later, Saavedra Lamas won   approval of the pact from all the American states at a special   session of the Seventh Pan-American Conference in Montevideo. U.   S. Secretary of State Cordell   Hull was present at this conference, as a personal guarantor,   so to speak, of the new policy which the United States had   inaugurated toward its sister nations on the American   continent.    That same year, 1933, Saavedra Lamas had succeeded in persuading   his government to change its attitude toward the League of   Nations, from which Argentina had withdrawn thirteen years   previously. He was now able to inform the Secretariat in Geneva   that henceforth Argentina wished to play an active part in the   work of the League of Nations. And since, as everyone knows,   there is greater joy in Heaven over one sinner who repents than   over ninety-nine who have no need to repent10, Argentina, too, received its reward. It   was immediately elected to the Council of the League, where it   kept its seat for the prescribed three years, which ended with   the opening of last September’s session.    The Antiwar Pact was officially presented to the League of   Nations Council in January, 1934, and was given a reception that   must surely have delighted its author. The pact has since been   signed by eleven nations outside America, including Norway, and   to date five of these have ratified it.    We can safely assume then that Saavedra Lamas regards his pact as   a kind of supplement to the League of Nations Covenant and as a   primary means of bringing countries outside the League of Nations   into its work to promote peace and prevent war, by imposing less   rigid demands on them than those prescribed in the League’s   Covenant.    We have evidence of his attitude in the fact that he has   submitted his pact to the commission set up by the Assembly of   the League of Nations last September to investigate improved ways   and means of implementing the principles set forth in the   Covenant. There may well be a question of whether Saavedra Lamas’   pact will be of decisive importance in the solution of   this great problem. The pact becomes operative only when a war   has already started; and the vital problem in the prevention of   war is to find ways to intervene with peacemaking procedures   before the storm of war breaks.    When the Argentine Antiwar Pact was submitted to the League   Council on January 18, 1934, British Foreign Minister Sir John   Simon 11 took the opportunity to   point out that the pact was of particular interest since the   Council had to deal, during the same session, with a serious   conflict precisely «in that part of the world occupied by   most of the signatory powers».    Needless to say, Saavedra Lamas had been aware of this fact all   along. Paraguay, although among the first states to sign the   pact, had never ratified it, and Bolivia did not ratify it until   July 1, 1935. So Saavedra Lamas was unable, in the case of these   two warring nations, to invoke the pact officially. He had to   bide his time. But in May of 1935, he took the very course of   action dictated by his own pact, approaching the Brazilian,   Chilean, and Peruvian diplomatic representatives in Buenos Aires   about setting in motion a common mediatory operation. A   conciliation commission was set up, composed of representatives   from Argentina, from the three countries already contacted, and   from the United States and Uruguay, under the chairmanship of   Saavedra Lamas himself; The foreign ministers of both Bolivia and   Paraguay were persuaded to take part in the commission’s   negotiations, and by the twelfth of June, 1935, two protocols had   been signed which brought hostilities to an end. The work was   later completed when the two belligerents accepted a final   settlement stipulating that any disagreement concerning the   implementation of the peace treaty should be resolved by the   Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague.    It must be recognized that the principles underlying Saavedra   Lamas’ Antiwar Pact have stood a practical test on South American   soil and under his personal leadership.    As foreign minister and leader of the Argentine delegation,   Saavedra Lamas participated in the recent Assembly of the League   of Nations. In recognition of his work for peace, the Assembly   elected him its president. In his opening address, he alluded to   the fact that the six American states, whose work of conciliation   he had headed, had succeeded in negotiating an end to the war in   South America, and that two of the six, the United States and   Brazil, were not members of the League of Nations. He added:   «The possibility therefore exists, in a concrete case   demanding mediation, of winning the cooperation of nations   outside our League. I see this as a significant signpost   for the diplomacy of peace. We must regard it not as an isolated   or exceptional occurrence but as one which will become the   rule.»    In making this statement, Saavedra Lamas has set a task for the   future. He is still a man in the prime of life. His recent   achievements in the politics of peace entitle us to hope that his   unusual energy and singleness of purpose will enable him to   contribute even more to the creation of a truly lasting peace   between nations.    1.

"21","1937","Robert Cecil"," Three statesmen who occupied leading   positions during the World War were so deeply struck by the   deprivation of human life and economic resources, by the futility   of war as a social institution, and by its amorality, that they   became convinced pacifists and throughout the rest of their lives   spared no effort to prevent such a calamity from ever again   overtaking mankind.    Two of the three are dead: Woodrow   Wilson and Aristide Briand.   The Nobel Committee has already honored them both with the Alfred   Nobel Prize. Today the Committee takes pleasure in presenting the   prize to the third, Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, perhaps better   known by his original name, Lord Robert Cecil.    It can perhaps be said of Wilson and Briand that they had some   points of contact with pacifist ideas: Wilson in his religious,   puritan tradition; Briand in the radical socialism of his   youth.    I doubt very much whether any parallel can be found in the case   of Lord Cecil, either in his traditions or in his background, or   in his prewar career. I am more inclined to believe that his   revulsion to war was aroused only and entirely through his   intimate contact with the war and his experiences as   under-secretary of state for foreign affairs and minister of   blockade1, and that it was these   which first led him to consider the problem of the abolition of   war, and so to devote all his efforts to bring nearer the   solution which to him appeared to be the right one.    Think of his background and traditions! The Cecil family is one   of the oldest and most distinguished among the English landed   aristocracy. His father, the Marquess of Salisbury, was for   nearly twenty years the leader of the Conservative Party, and for   most of this time prime minister2. In foreign affairs he accepted the legacy   of Disraeli3 and continued   Britain’s imperialist policy. In his early twenties the young   Lord Robert Cecil became a private secretary to his father, at   that time prime minister and foreign secretary. He fully shared   his father’s political and High Church views. It seems highly   improbable that, either in Hatfield or in the circles in which   Lord Robert moved in London, pacifism should at any time have   been discussed, except perhaps with a shrug of the shoulders, for   serious, realistic men cannot afford the luxury of such childish   dreams!    Being a younger son, Lord Robert decided to earn a living by   following a legal career. He developed into a skilled advocate,   and in due course became a Queen’s Counsel. In 1906, when he was   in his early forties, he was elected to Parliament and took his   place on the Conservative benches, under the leadership of his   cousin Arthur Balfour4. Although   his rise to prominence was not rapid, his reputation grew   steadily and he won recognition as an able orator and jurist. But   in 1915 when Asquith5, under the   pressure of war, formed a coalition government, Cecil became   under-secretary of state at the Foreign Office under Sir Edward   Grey6. The following year, when   Lloyd George7 succeeded in   overthrowing his chief and created his war ministry with a   program of «war to the bitter end», Cecil became   minister of blockade, one of the most exposed positions in the   government.    It was in the course of these war years, and especially during   his collaboration with the wise and admirable Edward Grey, that   Cecil first encountered the problem of pacifism. It presented   itself in the special guise which it had at that time assumed –   the question of a «League of Nations». The idea was   old, but during the war it acquired a distinctive form, and Cecil   had a large share in its shaping. He toiled over the question and   no doubt had many a struggle with it before he could clearly   grasp all its implications and consider himself fully and   confidently master of the problem.    It is fascinating to follow Cecil’s evolution as a pacifist and   internationalist during the two decades between his wartime   conversion and the present day. I deliberately use the religious   term «conversion», for clearly Lord Cecil is of a   fundamentally religious temperament – of the High Church   Episcopalian stamp. Listening to him speak from the rostrum is   often like listening to a venerable bishop preaching the revealed   truth. But he also has other strings to his bow in addition to   that of the preacher’s; he is a skillful lawyer, a quick-witted   debater, and, when the occasion demands, a shrewd tactician. His   tall, now somewhat bowed figure is imposing. But, even when he   jests and smiles, one can always sense an underlying earnestness   of purpose. The conversion from his youthful indifference to the   problem of peace, to the profound conviction of its central   importance which he now holds in maturity has been perhaps the   most momentous experience of his life.    What inhibitions and innate prejudices has he not had to conquer!   For no man can ever completely cast off the influences of   childhood and youth. The twenty years during which Cecil has   fought for pacifism and for the League of Nations are marked by   many instances when these inhibitions have emerged to lead him to   a self-contradictory position. There is much truth in what a   witty Irishman has said of him: «Lord Robert stands with one   foot in the Middle Ages and the other in the League of   Nations.»    But he has been true to his newfound conviction. That is the   important thing. And this fact redounds doubly to his credit,   precisely because he has had to resolve this conflict within   himself.    If we examine his purely intellectual attitude toward the League   of Nations problem, we cannot but marvel at the clarity with   which he formulated the essential points of his program at the   very outset, and at the consistency with which he has adhered to   them despite storm and stress.    On November 12, 1918, the day following the Armistice, he spoke   at the University of Birmingham about plans for a League of   Nations. He rejoiced that the war was over and that victory had   been won. But he strongly emphasized the responsibility which the   victory imposed on the victors. This responsibility was to   construct a lasting peace and to create an instrument for   international cooperation which might safeguard the permanence of   peace. He called upon the Allies to resist any temptation to   exploit their victory to gain mastery for themselves, and   appealed to them to create instead a League of Nations for   all nations – a league of independent nations, not a   superstate.    The principal foundation of this new League was not to be legal   institutions such as courts of law or arbitration. These should   be only the auxiliaries, the practical instruments sustaining the   dynamic force upon which the League of Nations should rest: a   vigilant and informed public opinion that would demand a   peaceful solution of disputes by legal judgment or arbitration if   possible, but in any case by negotiation and mediation. And this   public opinion should be given every chance to speak out whenever   dispute arose.    The crux of the whole system was therefore that the states should   agree not to resort to arms, not to «go to war», as the   new expression had it, but to bind themselves to delay and   discussion under the watchful eye of public opinion. Cecil   foresaw that governments would reserve the right to insist on   unanimity in all decisions, that they would not relinquish their   «liberum veto». But, he said, «Since the important   thing is to secure delay and open discussion – that is to say,   time to enable public opinion to act, and   information to instruct it – this is not a serious   objection to the proposal.» Here speaks an English   parliamentarian who knows that such a system has preserved his   country from revolution and has vouchsafed its peaceful   development for well-nigh three centuries. He hopes that other   nations will follow suit.    If a nation should break its promise by failing to delay action,   thus preventing negotiation, or by going to war before allowing a   reasonable respite, then the other nations must employ military   and economic sanctions against it. Lord Robert, the minister of   blockade during the war, attached particular weight to the   economic weapon. He spoke of disarmament as a necessary measure,   but at that time this decisive component of the system still lay   in the back of his mind.    Rather, he strongly emphasized the importance of harmonious   international cooperation which he, in complete accord with the   ideas of his close friend General Smuts8, wished to entrust to the League of Nations   in order to make the latter a permanent and working   instrument.    And so, even then, we already have a clear formulation of Cecil’s   concept of the League of Nations’ organization and of its   possibilities. In the period which followed, he returned to these   essential points again and again.    The first problem was to secure the acceptance of the Covenant of   the new League by all the nations. He was in complete agreement   with Wilson’s conviction that the Covenant must form an integral   part of the Peace Treaty itself. This was undoubtedly right. It   would have been politically and psychologically unwise to leave   the Covenant to be dealt with at some international conference   specially called to establish the League. In that event we should   not, in all probability, have got a League at all, certainly not   a satisfactory one. But it was a high price to pay, for serious   complications and setbacks followed. Unfortunately, we seldom get   anything for nothing, and nowhere is this more true than in   politics.    I shall not expatiate on Cecil’s role in the drafting of the   Covenant. Suffice it to say that he played a decisive part both   as lawyer and as politician. I will only add in passing that his   Conservative tradition came into play on just one occasion. He   insisted that only the great powers should be represented in the   Council of the League, its most important organ, especially with   respect to political questions. He saw the League as a   development and continuation of the old European Concert. But he   soon allowed himself to be persuaded that this would be wrong,   and he has since completely abandoned this view.    During the first three years of the League’s existence, from 1920   to 1923, Cecil figured prominently in its activities. He had left   Lloyd George’s ministry immediately after the war and was not   among the British delegates to these three assemblies. But   General Smuts, who had become his close friend, asked him to   represent South Africa in the Assembly. This was indeed   fortunate, for he could act with a great measure of freedom. I   wonder whether these three years were not among the happiest in   Lord Cecil’s political and international career.    It was quite clear to him from the very beginning that the League   was not a perfect or immutable instrument. It had to be nursed,   developed, and made to grow, both quantitatively in its   membership and qualitatively in the efficiency of its operation.   Lord Cecil stood in those early years at the head of the   progressive wing of the League. It is interesting to observe how   he systematically took up the points from the program outlined in   his Birmingham speech of 1918 and tried to put them into   practice.    Above all, he wanted to order the League’s work in such a way   that it would be pursued in the full light of publicity so that   it could be followed, stimulated, and criticized by public   opinion and by that most important disseminator of public   opinion, the press. With the support of delegates from   some of the smaller powers – not least, I am glad to say, the   Nordic states, foremost among whose representatives were Hjalmar Branting and Fridtjof Nansen – he forced through the   resolution that the Assembly should meet annually; that it should   be a fundamental rule that the meetings, both plenary and in   committee, should be held in public. Lastly, and most important   of all, he managed to introduce something of an innovation in   international politics: the Assembly’s sessions were to begin   each year with a general debate. This is a formal debate   based on the secretary-general’s annual report, but any subject   whatsoever of an international character can be brought to   discussion. The Assembly thus became a free tribune.    It is true that not always, indeed too seldom, does a debate lead   to genuine understanding based on an exchange of views, with   questions and answers; all too often the general debate   deteriorates, as is also sometimes the case with debates on the   speech from the Throne in our Parliament, to a series of   unrelated declarations on various questions. But there have been   times when the Assembly has suddenly been ignited by a spark   which has brought real fire into the debate.    It was Cecil who, on the third day of the First Assembly,   November 17, 1920, opened the general debate. His   speech9 was truly notable and I   should like to cite some of the points he made. He talked first   and at length of the necessity to rouse public opinion to work   with, for, and through the League. It was then that he coined a   phrase which became not only a slogan but indeed a program:   «Publicity is the very lifeblood of the League of   Nations.»    But he then went on to speak of the fundamental moral principles   which must govern the work of the League. The words he uttered   are remarkable coming from a Conservative politician from one of   the great powers; Unfortunately they were also prophetic:   «Do not let us be afraid of our power. Let us go on from   strength to strength. It is not by doing too much that the League   is in any danger. The one danger that threatens the League is   that it may gradually sink down into a position of respectable   mediocrity and useless complication with the diplomatic machinery   of the world… We must be ready to take a bold line in the great   work of reconciliation and pacification that lies before   us.»    He concluded his speech with a few personal words which no one   who heard them is likely to forget. «I stand before you as a   substitute of General Smuts. Think of that! General Smuts not so   many years ago was one of the most redoubtable and successful   commanders of the forces of the Boer nation when they were in   arms against the British Empire, and I was the son of the Prime   Minister who conducted the war on behalf of the British Empire.   And yet it now comes about that the General of the Boers goes to   the son of the British Prime Minister and asks him to appear   before the Assembly of the League of Nations as the best exponent   of the General’s views on international subjects. How has that   result come about? Not by timidity, not by shrinking from a bold   action, but by a great act of trust in the Boer people, an act   which, I do not hesitate to say, at the moment seemed to me rash   and perhaps premature, but which has more than justified itself   by its results.» (He is, of course, referring to   Campbell-Bannerman’s10   dissolution in 1906 of the emergency government imposed on South   Africa after the war, and the granting of self-rule as a   Dominion.)    «Surely», Cecil continued, «that is an example to   us… Do not let us shrink from even strong measures of   pacification and reconciliation. Believe me, they will justify   themselves in the future. I will say to this Assembly with all   the emphasis at my command, let their motto be: ‹Be just   and fear not.› »    It would take much too long to review here Lord Robert’s work in   and for the League of Nations. Let us recall just one or two   facts.    The League had in 1920 set up a Permanent Court of International   Justice, in accordance with Article 14 of the Covenant, and the   first panel of judges was named in 1921. Cecil took an active   part in this work and, when it was completed, he reminded the   League of the other «article of promise» in the   Covenant, Article 8, which requires that disarmament be carried   out by means of international agreements.   «Disarmament», he said, «is the next great cause   with which the League must concern itself.»    And to this cause he devoted great effort. He explored avenues   which he thought might provide a short cut, but which sometimes   turned out to be blind alleys. But at no time did he lose sight   of the goal.    For ten years after joining the new Conservative government under   Stanley Baldwin11 in 1923, he   was the United Kingdom delegate both in the Council and in the   Assembly, although with some interruptions, as for instance   during the first Labor government in 1924, «the year of the   Geneva Protocol»12. His   official position now tied his hands and he no longer possessed   the freedom of action which he had enjoyed as representative of   his friend and ally General Smuts. He was not always able to sit   on the disarmament commissions. It is no secret that he sometimes   thought of leaving the Conservative Party, but the bonds which   tied him to the party of his forebears proved too strong. He   remained in its ranks, representing the British Empire – for   example, on the preparatory disarmament commission charged with   the study of the technical aspects of the disarmament   problem.    Many times during those years he watched with dismay the   undermining of the League by the policy supported by certain   governments, including his own, which was reducing the League to   that «respectable mediocrity» which was, as he had said   in his first speech in the Assembly, what he feared most.    The weak policy of the great powers toward Japan in 1931-1932 was   a step in this undermining policy, and the last time Cecil   attended the Assembly in September, 1932, he delivered a   memorable and dynamic speech on the question of disarmament,   describing it as a touchstone for the will to peace. If   disarmament were once carried through, he said, the international   atmosphere would suddenly be transformed. The nations would have   cast their ultimate vote for peace. If, on the other hand, they   rejected disarmament, the world would sink back into the state of   prewar days.    I am inclined to believe that Cecil intended this remarkable   speech to mark his farewell to the policy of his party at home.   In the House of Lords, where he had sat since he had become   Viscount Cecil of Chelwood in 1923, he now took his place on the   nonparty cross-benches. There he joined company with the bishops   who, of course, hold themselves aloof from party   allegiances.    He was again a free man.    Archimedes has said: «Give me a place to stand outside the   earth and I will move the earth.»    From the very first, Cecil has worked to obtain a platform   outside the League in order to keep it moving. That platform he   has sought and found in public opinion. His initiative helped to   establish the League of Nations Union13 in Great Britain, an influential   organization which has some impressive achievements to its   credit. Cecil remains its president to this day.    England’s example has been followed in most other countries.   Cecil has also been president of the International Federation of   the League of Nations Societies14 for two years, the presidency of this   organization changing in rotation.    The bitter disappointments of recent years have in no way   succeeded in cooling Cecil’s ardor. He has been the main   instigator of two big attempts to mobilize public opinion in the   fight against war and international anarchy.    The first of these was national in character, the so-called   «Peace Ballot» of 1934, an unofficial referendum to   sound public opinion on the League of Nations. Cecil had planned   the program, directed publicity, and was himself an active   participant. The optimists had hoped to receive four to five   million replies to the five questions put. In actual fact no less   than eleven and a half million questionnaires were returned, and   it transpired that an overwhelming majority, eleven million, were   in favor of the League of Nations, ten and a half million for   disarmament, ten million for the use of economic sanctions   against an aggressor, 6,780,000 for military sanctions.    The most valuable result of this endeavor was that not only those   who had cast their votes but many others besides were led to   consider the problem of peace and its solution through the medium   of the League of Nations. At the same time public opinion had   unmistakably expressed itself in favor of the League of Nations;   so when the Baldwin government proclaimed a general election at a   time when the Ethiopian crisis was becoming increasingly grave,   it was forced to declare itself firmly in favor of the   «collective system». We know, unfortunately, that once   the election was over and once the government had won its   victory, it retreated from the consequences: it chose to abandon   the sanctions and to embark instead upon the most gigantic   rearmament program that our time has known.    It is common knowledge that this was a painful blow to Lord   Cecil. He was now seventy years old; anyone in his position might   have been tempted to give up, and a private speech of his   suggests that he had come close to losing his fighting   spirit.    It is thus all the more admirable that he nevertheless decided to   launch a new venture. He had shown that he had the support of   British public opinion. Now he took on the difficult task of   mobilizing international opinion: together with the French   politician Pierre Cot he planned the International Peace   Campaign15. It was, so to speak,   a «quand même» from the old man.    The movement has achieved considerable success. The support which   this new organization has obtained – ranging from conservatives   like Cecil himself, his friend Lord Lytton, and other prominent   conservatives all over the world, through liberals, radicals, the   cooperative movement, and other nonpolitical groups, to   socialists and communists – shows how alert public opinion has   actually become to the danger of another war. It is the   dictators’ menacing attack upon world peace in Africa, Spain, and   the Far East which has created the need for concentration.   Unfortunately the membership of the Campaign is not as   comprehensive as one would have wished, for no one living under   the dictatorships can give it open support.    The International Peace Campaign does not seek to compete with   any of the existing organizations; its object is to unite them in   a common front to promote concentrated action. Its program is   therefore very moderate. It works for the maintenance of what   some years ago was thought to be a lasting basis for   international cooperation and peace. It demands, for the   strengthening of the «collective system», only two, but   two very important, reforms, which in any case already form an   integral part of the program set out in the League of Nations   Covenant: international disarmament and «establishment   within the framework of the League of Nations of effective   machinery for remedying international conditions which might lead   to war»16.    It is admirable and yet at the same time sad to note that Lord   Cecil’s last great effort is not only generally consistent with   but practically follows word for word the thoughts expressed in   his speech at the University of Birmingham nearly twenty years   ago. Admirable, because it underlines the unity and continuity in   his lifelong work for peace; sad, because it shows that, in the   fearful winter which we are experiencing in our international   life, it is unhappily necessary to rebuild everything from the   ground up. The stone of Sisyphus!    But to the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize this year, Lord Cecil   of Chelwood, I think we should address the lines of a Danish poet   about the hero Sisyphus: Not the deed fulfilled, but tireless     exertion     Shall hear you, O Man, into the ranks of the Heroes.    1.

"22","1938","Nansen International Office for Refugees"," This year, as we all know, the Nobel Peace   Prize has been awarded to the Nansen Office, whose president, Mr.   Michael Hansson, has come here to receive the award. We have   asked him to tell us about the work of the Nansen Office, for he   can certainly give a much more vivid account of this work than   could any member of the Nobel Committee on the basis of written   reports. The main speech of the day will therefore be made by Mr.   Hansson, but first of all I should like to say a few words.    Whenever the Nansen Office is mentioned, one figure immediately   springs to mind, that of Fridtjof   Nansen. It is only a few years since he died, but his image   grows larger with every passing year. We meet him everywhere: in   science, in art, in deep and unbiased human thought, in politics.   And in political life we meet him wherever new ideas and new   claims are being tested. It is not as an advocate of a party nor   of a single nation that he appears to us – it is as a   representative of mankind itself. He stands for the rights and   the dignity of man, and it is to the spirit of man that he   appeals. He was the champion of a cause new to politics, the   cause of brotherly love, and he performed wonders, first for the   prisoners of war, and then for the political refugees. When he   died, a great deal had already been accomplished, but much still   remained to be done. So his work had to be carried on. It has   been divided between two organizations, a High Commission in   London for German refugees1 and   the office in Geneva2 which now   bears the name of Fridtjof Nansen and which has this year been   awarded the Peace Prize.    It had been estimated that the work of these organizations would   be completed within eight to ten years. It was decided at the   very beginning, therefore, that they would end their activities   on December 31 of this year. This period, then, will soon have   elapsed. Once again, a great deal has been achieved, with much   still remaining to be done. There is little doubt that the   refugees in need of assistance at the time of Nansen’s death have   been helped to a very great extent. In the meantime, however, new   disasters have occurred, once more leaving crowds of refugees in   their wake, refugees who are at this very moment pouring out of   their countries in perhaps even greater numbers than ever   before.    The work entrusted to these two institutions must accordingly   continue – it cannot cease on December 31 of this year. The   institutions themselves will disappear but, fortunately, their   work will go on. It will do so through the amalgamation of the   two institutions that have hitherto shared it into a single High   Commission situated in London where all activity will be   coordinated.    The work accomplished by the Nansen Office throughout its years   of operation is great. And it is easy to see that it has been   influenced by the traditions of Fridtjof Nansen’s time. It is   marked by two characteristics that rarely go together, but which   in Nansen were combined: the highest idealism and an exceptional   faculty for the practical. The work has carried a message to   thousands of refugees all over the world who have waited helpless   and wretched or have roamed from country to country without   respite. But it has borne a message not only to them. It has   borne a message to those in politics, that political action has a   higher goal than that of sowing discord and harvesting hate. It   has borne a message to each of us, that however secure we may be   within our country’s frontiers, we must not forget that the world   is much greater than our little corner of it and that mankind’s   children, wherever they may be and whatever they believe, are   joined together by a common destiny and by an indissoluble and   inflexible solidarity. Everything that happens affects us all; we   must share not only the reward but, most assuredly, the   responsibility too.    But it is not only the Nansen Office that we should remember on   this its day of tribute. It was created by the League of Nations   and supported by it, and at this time when many appear to be   losing faith in the League, it is right and fitting to recall   this fact. What we really need is an international body vested   with the power which would place it above the states, a body that   could maintain discipline, that could prevent war and create   peace; but this we do not possess, at least not yet. Still we do   possess something, something we can never give up now that it has   been created: a platform for those who wish to be heard, an   international meeting place, and, above all, an effective medium   for extensive humanitarian work. And it may be that fate has   forced us onto the right path. Perhaps it is precisely here that   we should begin, with a worldwide humanitarian work that will   pave the way for the more stable organization of which we have   dreamed and for which we have hoped.    Mr. Hansson will speak about the work of the Nansen Office. But I   wish to mention one aspect which he cannot include: the   tremendous personal contribution he himself has made to it. All   of us have admired not only the rare administrative ability that   he has shown, but also the tinselfish devotion he has brought to   the work and the warm humanity that has distinguished his   mission. We are glad that he has been able to come here today as   a representative of the Nansen Office so that we can deliver the   insignia of the prize into his hands.    1. The High commission for   Refugees coming from Germany was established in October, 1933, by   the League of Nations and incorporated into the League in   1936    2. The Nansen International Office   for Refugees was created by a League resolution in September,   1930. It replaced the League’s High commission for Refugees   established June 27, 1921, under the direction of Dr. Nansen who   remained High Commissioner until his death."
"23","1944","International Committee of the Red Cross","   Six years have passed since we last awarded the Peace Prize, six years during which war has dominated the world. These war years, in which men have fought for life and freedom on a scale unprecedented in the annals of history, have offered few opportunities to speak and work for peace. In this respect they are in contrast to the years of the First World War, when the ideology of peace not only survived but even exerted an appreciable influence on many belligerent and neutral countries. Nevertheless, the Nobel Committee has found some who have been able, even during this last war, to work for the cause of mankind and for the creation of the international organization whose task will be to bring to reality the dream of preventing war. The Nobel Committee has awarded the Peace Prize for 1944 to the lnternational Committee of the Red Cross and that for 1945 to Mr. Cordell Hull of the United States. The International Committee of the Red Cross was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on a previous occasion in the year 1917. The prize was given then while the war was still raging; this time it is given after the advent of peace; but in both cases it was earned by work done during wartime. Philip Noel-Baker put it well when he proposed that the prize be awarded to the International Committee of the Red Cross because the Committee «by its action throughout this war has held aloft the fundamental conceptions of the solidarity of the human race, and the identity of the vital interests of different nations and of the need for true understanding and reconciliation, if peace is ever to be brought about». In doing so, it has contributed to the promotion of the concept of that «fraternity among nations» referred to in Nobel’s testament. The International Committee of the Red Cross is international in its activities, but it is national in its composition, for all its members are Swiss citizens. It is not by mere coincidence that it has found its home in Switzerland whose very atmosphere must give it vitality. For this little democracy has learned by experience that it is not impossible to forge solidarity between peoples of different origin. But, as is so often the case when institutions are established, this one, too, owes its origin to the initiative of a single man. And today, in awarding the Peace Prize to the International Committee of the Red Cross, we cannot but think back to Henri Dunant who was given no peace by the horrors of Solferino’s battlefields until he had made others aware of them1. His idea can be expressed as follows: We must try to mitigate the horrors of war, to reduce as far as possible the number of its victims, and to prevent as far as possible the suffering it causes. This work must be organized in advance before war breaks out, for no one knows where or when war will come; and it must be organized on an international scale. In this way we shall also invoke and develop the spirit of brotherly love which will oppose war in the most telling manner. It is on this idea that the work of the Red Cross is founded. Since he wrote this, many of his ideas have been realized. After its modest beginning in 1863 under the auspices of the Societe genevoise d’utilite publique [Geneva Society for Public Welfare], the organized work he mentions has been solidly established through the Red Cross, and the Geneva Convention of 1864 has made it possible to carry on the work during war2. And so, in some respects, the work has been made international, but here as in so many other fields it has been difficult to awaken the spirit of brotherly love. I shall not elaborate here on the development of the International Committee of the Red Cross, on the more highly organized form it took through its statutes of 1921 and in subsequent years, on its function as a link between the National Red Cross Societies, or on many other aspects of it. It is on its work during the wars that I would like to concentrate. The first really great test to face the Committee came during the First World War. Its task could be said to be twofold: it had, first, to ensure that the provisions of the Geneva Convention were observed and, second, to forward information concerning prisoners of war and so on, and to give help where help was needed. We have to admit from the outset that the first task was not an easy one and that the protests from Geneva in most cases produced meager results. The second task, on the other hand, was carried out successfully during the First World War and contributed in a large degree to lessening the suffering of prisoners of war. During the Second World War, its activity has for the most part been similar in nature, but its scope has greatly increased and has gradually been extended to new fields. The Committee’s principal mission during the last war was to serve as a comprehensive information center on prisoners of war. This has been not only an arduous but also a very extensive undertaking. With the war still fresh in our minds, we can appreciate more than ever before what it means to be able to obtain news of the fate of a father, a brother, or a friend. And even more important, what it means to have an organization that can transmit correspondence between prisoners of war and their relatives. It was first and foremost the Committee which undertook this work. Another service which was of much greater importance during this war than during the first, was the distribution of parcels to prisoners of war, both those from relatives and also the collective parcels which were paid for partly by the belligerent powers and partly by contributions collected in various other countries. I should mention here that the Committee arranged for the distribution of, in all, several hundred thousand tons of goods. Its work in this field on behalf of prisoners of war was truly immense. But prisoners of war were not the only ones to receive aid nor were they the ones who needed it most. In greater need were the other prisoners, the civilian prisoners or the «political prisoners», as the Germans liked to call them. Their treatment and fate are so well known that I shall mention them only briefly. They were without legal rights, and there was no international agreement giving the International Committee of the Red Cross the right to intervene on their behalf. It was, moreover, difficult to achieve anything in the face of the Nazi regime in Germany. Not until the winter of 1942-1943 did Germany authorize the Committee to send parcels to political prisoners; and shipping could not be started until the fall of 1943, and then only after many difficulties. Eventually, however, it did reach proportions which made it possible to save many lives. While this work was being successfully pursued, the Committee encountered such great difficulties in the other parts of its activities that the results fell short of its expectations. I refer particularly of course to the pro raised against infringements of international law relating to the treatment of prisoners of war. During this war, just as in the previous one, such protests rarely had any effect. In contrast, the inspection of prisoner-of-war camps, carried out by the Committee’s delegations, proved to be effective although no inspection was possible of camps in Russia or Japan, or of Russian prisoner-of-war camps in Germany and the occupied countries, because neither Russia nor Japan had ratified the Prisoners of War Convention of 1929. This shows that full benefit can never be derived from a convention unless it achieves universal acceptance. Needless to say, the Committee was unable to inspect the concentration camps in Germany or in the countries under its occupation since Germany considered them an internal political matter. Another great service accomplished during the last war concerned the exchange of prisoners. Although such exchanges were admittedly initiated by the belligerents, the value of the contribution of the International Committee of the Red Cross cannot be overstated. Mere listing of the activities of the International Committee of the Red Cross cannot give a true picture of its significance; this lies fundamentally in the fact that human lives have been saved and in the feeling of solidarity engendered by help that has penetrated the iron walls erected by war. On behalf of the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament, I have the honor to present the Peace Prize for 1944 to the International Committee of the Red Cross for the great work it has performed during the war in behalf of humanity. 1.

"24","1945","Cordell Hull"," Cordell Hull has devoted his entire life to   the stabilization of international relations. Best known to the   public are his untiring efforts in the field of commercial   policy, efforts inspired by his desire to counteract autarchic   tendencies both in the U.S.A. and abroad. Of these efforts, which   considerably influenced national policies during the period   between the wars and especially at the end of the twenties, he   says: «There can be no real progress toward confidence or   peace nor permanent trade recovery while retaliations and bitter   trade controversies rage.»1   Confidence and peace between nations have constituted his goal in   all spheres of his activity. This is the driving spirit behind   his fight against isolationism at home, his efforts to create a   peace bloc of states on the American continents, and his work for   the United Nations   Organization.    Cordell Hull was born in 1871 in the state of Tennessee in the   United States of America. He passed his law exams as a relatively   young man, practiced for some years as an attorney, and later   became a judge. But at a very early stage in his career he   embarked on a political career in the ranks of the Democratic   Party. It is as a politician that he is known and it is to   politics that he has devoted all his endeavors from about the age   of twenty. Not until 1907, however, did he enter the House of   Representatives. Prior to that time it is not easy to discern any   clues to his later political attitude in the international field,   but his work reveals evidence of the conscientious and meticulous   manner in which he attacked problems. A key to his general   outlook is provided by some passages in his maiden speech in the   House. In this speech he championed compulsory arbitration   between workers and employers, supported efficient regulation by   the federal government of railway and shipping rates, and opposed   the abuse of power by large corporations in certain fields. The   same basic outlook can also be detected in his speeches on tax   reforms. At that time, the revenues of the federal government   were derived from indirect taxation, mostly from tariffs, the   United States Supreme Court having declared in 1895 that the   introduction of an income tax in 1894 was a breach of the federal   constitution    Refusing to accept this judgment, Hull reopened the question of   taxation and, after the victory of the Democrats in 1912, managed   to secure the introduction of income tax. What interests us,   however, is not so much the tax reform itself, as Hull’s argument   in its favor. He certainly saw it as a means of increasing   federal income, but his first concern was with the effects of   this tax as against those of the tariffs. He was convinced that   protectionism created monopoly and enriched the few at the   expense of the many, and that such a system could not be   reconciled with the free competition in which he believed.    We see him here as representative of all that is best in   liberalism, a liberalism with a strong social implication. At   that time, however, he had not yet given utterance to his   international views.    They found expression initially during the First World War. As   Hinton, his biographer, says: «Up to this time Hull’s tariff   theories had been based on his belief that protection was a   domestic evil.»2 By the end   of the war his view on economic policy could be expressed as   follows: High tariffs are barriers obstructing the development of   trade and friendship between nations, thereby becoming barriers   also to lasting international peace.    In his great speech to Congress on September 10, 1918, he   expressed his view in these words: «Believing as I have that   the best antidote against war is the removal of its causes rather   than its prevention after the causes once arise, and finding that   trade retaliation and discrimination in its more vicious forms   have been productive of bitter economic wars which in many cases   have developed into wars of force, I introduced the resolution in   the House of Representatives during the early part of last year   which would provide for the organization of an international   trade-agreement congress the objects of which should be to   eliminate by mutual agreement all possible methods of retaliation   and discrimination in international trade.»3    As early as 1917, he put forward the idea of an international   agreement to govern the methods employed in commercial   competition. The task of reducing trade restrictions was taken up   in the League of Nations and a basis for the work of the   following years established at the great world conference in 1927   at Geneva4. The culmination of   these efforts was the World Economic Conference in London in 1933   which Hull himself attended, this time as secretary of state. All   of us who took part in this work during those years know how   every proposal we made encountered resistance time and again from   various countries whose attitudes were governed exclusively by   the political situation at home. The 1933 conference, as we know,   failed to achieve anything. It may be that it was a mistake to   lay so much stress on the question of stabilization of currency   from the very beginning; it was this which led to Roosevelt’s   famous telegram in which he rejected the plan for currency   stabilization on the grounds that, as he put it, a nation’s   prosperity depends more upon a healthy internal economic   structure than it does upon the price of its currency in relation   to the price of currencies of other nations. This attitude, which   prevailed in the United States and was expressed by Roosevelt in   his telegram, brought Hull’s work in this direction to a halt. As   has so often been the case in international politics, people   could see the difficulties in their own country and had faith in   their ability to solve them in isolation from the world. Hull   himself in no way subscribed to this view. In a speech given on   July 27, 1933, in London, he said: «At this moment the world   is still engaged in wild competition, in economic armaments which   constantly menace both peace and commerce.» And a little   later in the speech he added: «Indispensable and   all-important as domestic programs are, they cannot by themselves   restore business to the highest levels of permanent   recovery.»5    Yet Hull did not give up, even though the London conference was a   setback for his ideas. In 1934 he secured the passage of a   bill6 empowering the president to   lower tariffs by fifty percent and to reduce import restrictions   for countries prepared to grant similar concessions to the United   States. He was eventually able to conclude no fewer than   twenty-seven trade agreements on the basis of this bill.    This law, which was subject to a time limitation, was last   renewed in 1945 and authorized the president to reduce tariffs by   forty-five percent. This was, of course, after Hull had retired,   but it represented nevertheless a victory for his policy.    All of this marks a radical change in the economic policy of the   United States; it is an affirmation of England’s policy during   the free trade period, taking as a model the Cobden Treaty of   1860 of which the «most-favored nation» clause formed   an integral part7. Although the   change is partly due to the acceptance of the United States as a   creditor nation, it signifies something more profound for Hull:   it is his immutable belief that it will clear the way for   improved international relations and remove one of the causes of   war. It is so typical of the man: if he does not succeed with a   frontal assault, then he immediately reconnoiters the flanks. He   yields to defeat, but he never accepts it as final, for his   belief in the cause is too firmly rooted. And he is realist   enough to recognize what is politically feasible at any given   time, choosing to accept that rather than await something which   may, perhaps, come one day.    I have dwelt at some length on Hull’s work in formulating   economic policies since it reveals characteristic traits in his   philosophy and method, but in so doing I have anticipated the   events of his life.    I had come to his work in the House of Representatives. He became   a member of the Senate in 1929, but it was with the election of   Roosevelt in 1932 that, as secretary of state8, he first had the opportunity to devote   himself entirely to his ideas. Now it is always very difficult to   say to what extent ideas and policies derive from the secretary   of state and in what measure from the president. And this is even   more difficult with a man like Hull, because, as Sumner Welles   says: «Cordell Hull is the least selfseeking man I have ever   known. One of the striking sidelights on the years of his   distinguished statesmanship has been his willingness to stay in   the background and to let others take the credit and glory. I   know of several outstanding instances where Mr. Hull carefully   diverted attention away from his own authorship or able   sponsorship of a good plan so that some temperamental foreign   government official might acquire merit in the eyes of his   constituents at home as father of the proposal. Mr. Hull was   content that the good idea should take root and   flourish.»9    This is high praise indeed for any man, but still more laudatory   when said of a politician, since it is seldom that politicians   are eulogized in such terms.    It is impossible, in this brief synopsis, to review Hull’s work   in the years following 1932, for this would entail an examination   of the United States’ foreign policy during that period.    No foreign minister can have held office in more difficult times.   As I have already mentioned, the year in which he took up his   appointment heralded the defeat of economic cooperation and the   accession of Hitler to power in Germany. Each year brought events   that could have driven anyone to despair and that inexorably led   toward another world war. Yet Hull never gave up, despite   opposition both at home and abroad. If he found one path to the   implementation of his ideas blocked, he would try another. If he   could not achieve his ideal immediately, he would make the best   of the situation and return to the attack when the time was   ripe.    Nothing illustrates his approach better than his Pan-American   policy and his attitude to the laws of neutrality. The   Pan-American policy sponsored by Roosevelt and Hull was launched   at the Montevideo Conference of 1933 at which all the American   republics were represented. Roosevelt’s «good neighbor   policy» was at once the starting point and the goal of a   policy which, recognizing the impossibility of embracing the   whole world, aimed first and foremost at creating peace and good   neighborliness among the nations of the American continents. As   Hull said in a private conversation, «We ought to be able to   work out a pattern of life which will inspire the whole world to   follow our example when the present tumult dies   down.»10    At this conference a convention was successfully drafted defining   the rights and obligations of each nation. Its most important   clause, perhaps, was that which stated that no nation has the   right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of any   other. This conference was followed by the one in Buenos Aires in   1936 and by the Lima Conference of 1938. One of the achievements   of the Buenos Aires Conference was the approval of an agreement   for collective security and neutrality in the event of war. When   the Lima Conference took place, the outlook in Europe had become   more ominous, and a firmer and more somber tone could be   discerned in Hull’s speeches which focused on the threat   emanating from the totalitarian states. At Lima, Hull did not   attain the goal which he sought. The conference certainly   represented a victory for the ideals of peace, but little   progress was made beyond the point reached in the conferences at   Montevideo and Buenos Aires. The chief stumbling block was the   stand taken by Argentina who, for several reasons, was unable to   commit herself to the same extent as the United States. But to   this must be added a circumstance which affected all the   Pan-American conferences; namely, the relation of the countries   involved to the League of Nations. The South American countries   were members, the United States was not; and this fact gave rise   to difficulties which prevented the conferences from achieving   the desired results. In Europe, these Pan-American conferences   have often been looked upon as a form of expanded isolationism,   but they should not be so regarded. They are large-scale attempts   to realize the ideas of peace by international cooperation   wherever this appears to be practical, and to create, as Cordell   Hull says, an example which will inspire the whole world.    The struggle on the law of neutrality and the fight against   isolationism are so recent as to be fresh in our memories. The   original law of neutrality can in one sense be said to serve the   idea of peace, and it cannot be denied that isolationism was   pacifist in outlook. But while the isolationists regarded peace   primarily as peace for the United States, Hull envisaged a more   flexible form of neutrality which would permit the United States   to cooperate with other countries in maintaining peace, because,   as he put it, the United States cannot unilaterally proclaim   peace for herself alone. In this as in other declarations he   returns again and again to the theme that peace is not to be   thought of as a privilege for any particular nation. For him   peace means peace among all nations. But he is realist enough to   know that it is necessary to struggle to achieve it.    As already mentioned, Hull did not mince his words when   discussing relations with the totalitarian states in Europe and,   as the war drew nearer, he made his speeches sharper and more   intense. Everything within him – his sense of justice, his deep   humanism – revolted against what he considered an encroachment   upon and a violation of everything that stood for decency. But on   the outbreak of war his voice was dominated by that of Roosevelt,   who now spoke more strongly than before as the leader of United   States’ foreign policy. This had to be, and it is hard for anyone   not intimately involved to assess the credit due to Cordell   Hull’s work during these years. One can only draw some   conclusions from the little that is known: He has devoted every   effort to strengthening the forces marshaled against the   aggressive powers, but at the same time has worked intensely on   the problems which will arise with the coming of peace. The   direction these efforts were taking could be discerned in the   draft of the six clauses governing the future policy of the four   great powers11, adopted at the   Moscow Conference of 1943. Moreover, as we now know, he devoted   strenuous efforts during the last stage of the war to the   resolution of problems associated with the setting up of the new   organization «The United Nations». That is his latest   contribution. He says himself in the letter of   resignation12 which he wrote to   Roosevelt on November 21, 1944, after deciding to retire because   of ill health: «It is a supreme tragedy to me personally   that I am unable to continue making my full contribution to such   great international undertakings as the creation of the postwar   peace organization, the solution of the many other problems   involved in the promotion of international cooperation, and the   final development of a full and complete structure of a world   order under law.»    To this letter Roosevelt replied13: «Incidentally, when the organization   of the United Nations is set up, I shall continue to pray that   you as the Father of the United Nations may preside over its   first session. That has nothing to do with whether you are   Secretary of State or not at that time, but should go to you as   the one person in all the world who has done the most to make   this great plan for peace an effective fact. In so many different   ways you have contributed to friendly relations among nations   that even though you may not remain in a position of executive   administration, you will continue to help the world with your   moral guidance.»    «Father of the United Nations» Roosevelt called him.   Hull will assuredly not claim that the organization was his work.   For him it was of very little importance whether the credit went   to him or to someone else, provided the ideas triumphed. For,   despite his great idealism, he has always lived in the world of   reality, never doubting that it could be molded to fit the   principles of justice. Principles of justice, which in the United   States, perhaps more than anywhere else, become the heritage of   every individual from his schooldays on, have been the guiding   star of his work, the locus where life and creed become   one.    It is therefore with the greatest satisfaction that the Nobel   Committee of the Norwegian Parliament presents the Peace Prize   for 1945 to this great American for his long and indefatigable   work for understanding between nations.    1.

"25","1946","Emily Greene Balch, John R. Mott"," The environment in which a child is brought   up almost invariably leaves a distinct and indelible mark on its   character. This appears to have been the case with Emily Greene   Balch.    Born in Boston in 1867, she comes from an old New England family   and grew up in stimulating intellectual surroundings whose   traditions can be traced back to the Puritans who first colonized   that part of the United States. These New Englanders had freed   themselves from the harshness of puritanism, but they inherited   the strict self-discipline and energy and desire to make this   world a better place to live in, especially for the less   fortunate members of society. In this environment she acquired a   certain idealism, an awareness of her personal responsibility;   yet at the same time she learned to recognize that work for a   better world can be fruitful only if it is based on the hard   facts of reality.    As a young student she was first attracted to the study of   literature, but she was soon to take an interest in the work to   which she was to devote all her energies in the period preceding   the First World War: the improvement of conditions of life   through social reform. The necessity of such work was first   brought home to her when she became acquainted with the poverty   and squalor of the slums in America’s big cities. She   collaborated in the founding of a social center in Boston and   undertook other practical work as well, becoming a member of the   American Federation of Labor and helping to establish the Women’s   Trade Union League of America.    All this was in the early 1890’s at a time when Europe was   becoming increasingly conscious of the untold social problems   bequeathed by the Industrial Revolution. But the dawn of   enlightenment had not yet broken over America.    Practical work alone, however, did not exhaust the aspirations   that gripped Emily Balch. She felt the need both to acquire   knowledge and to pass it on to others if she was to achieve more.   And so she continued her studies, first in Paris under   Levasseur1, the historian of the   French working class, and later in Berlin where she studied that   branch of economics which has been called a «professor-chair   socialism»2. Here she also   came in contact with the European labor movement and attended the   Socialist Trade Union Congress in 1896.    In the same year she went to Wellesley College, first as lecturer and then   as professor of social economics. Teaching was her principal   occupation up to the First World War. But her teaching went hand   in hand with practical social work in the field, membership on   official commissions, and authorship of publications. A typical   example is her work concerning immigrants. She was the first   professor in America to give students a course of lectures on   problems relating to immigrants. Best known, undoubtedly, is her   work on the Slav immigrants in the United States, a work which is   said to be a landmark in the scientific analysis of immigration   problems3. This work provides a   perfect illustration of her approach: before putting pen to paper   she visited most of the Slav centers in the United States and   also did research for a year in those regions of Austria-Hungary   from which many of the immigrants came. Not content to rely on   verbal or written sources, she felt she had to see things for   herself, to meet these people, and to study their conditions at   first hand.    And then came the First World War, putting an end to her   university career, for she was dismissed from her post in 1918   because of her pacifist activities. But the war also brought a   fresh challenge, giving her life a new goal. Like so many others,   she saw the war as a futile interruption to the construction of a   better world.    To use her own words: «My reaction was above all a feeling   that this was a tragic break in the work which to me appeared to   be the real task of our time: to construct a more satisfying   economic order.» But the impact upon her must have been more   powerful than she herself cared to admit, for from the outbreak   of the war she devoted all her strength to the work for peace.   Or, as Professor Simkhovitch of Columbia4 says: «I have never met anyone who has,   as she has done, for decade after decade given every minute of   her life to the work for peace between nations.»    Emily Balch probably did not realize – and few did at that time –   that 1914 was, more than 1939, the great turning point of our   era. It marked the end of an epoch, and subsequent events have,   in many ways, robbed people of their faith in the individual and   in justice, which have been the heritage and the source of   strength for the best in this world. Men have grown harder since   then, more skeptical, and the doctrine that might is right has   found its way increasingly into both internal and external   policies, even after the end of this last war.    These then are the times in which Emily Balch has waged her fight   for peace. They have not been easy, but she has never relaxed her   efforts, whatever the obstacles in her path.    Throughout the many years of her work for peace she has been   closely associated with the Women’s International League for   Peace and Freedom, founded at The Hague in 1915 while war was   being waged. The League provided a meeting place for women from   neutral countries, the Central powers, and the Allied nations.   Such a conference was still feasible at that time, for the   monstrous beast of war had not yet fully bared his fangs. But the   remarkable thing is that this was the only group of any   importance within the belligerent countries to meet and reach   agreement on a just and practical program for peace. For it   really was practical, especially if we judge it against the   background of its time. «I think the proposal is without any   doubt the best which has so far been put forward,» declared   President Wilson to the chairman   of the Women’s League, Jane   Addams. Many of the resolutions were subsequently   incorporated in the League of Nations Covenant. Although the   program was drawn up by the conference itself, its realistic   provisions owe much to the wealth of knowledge and practical   foresight contributed by Emily Balch5.    Following the conference at The Hague, two delegations, one of   them headed by Emily Balch, visited neutral and belligerent   countries alike to submit their resolutions to the statesmen. A   polite reception was accorded to them everywhere. This is not   surprising, for the statesman is as a rule polite, perhaps   especially so when dealing with women, but his true thoughts   inevitably remain concealed behind his inscrutable smile. The   women failed to make any headway with their proposals; and this   was only to be expected with things as they were.    In 1916 Emily Balch visited Stockholm and took part in the   Neutral Conference for Continuous Mediation which was sponsored   by Henry Ford6. At this   conference she put forward her proposal for «International   Colonial Administration», a proposal which foreshadows the   mandate system later adopted at Versailles.    On returning home in 1916, she joined the ranks of those who were   fighting against America’s entry into the war. She was a member   of the Collegiate Anti-Militarism League7 and also sat on the council of the Fellowship of   Reconciliation8. As already   mentioned, her work for peace and her radical social views led to   the loss of her professorial position in 1918. Thereafter she   joined the editorial staff of the Nation, a weekly which   was in the forefront of the struggle for a just and permanent   peace.    With the coming of peace, the Women’s League arranged its second   conference at Zurich in 1919 while the Allies were discussing the   peace treaty in Paris. The conference thus had the opportunity of   studying a draft of the peace treaty. Time does not permit me to   review the resolutions which were passed as a result of this   study. What I can and will say is that it would have been   judicious to have heeded the women’s counsel. That few did so is   sad, though hardly astonishing in view of the political climate   of the time. Besides, the proposals had been put forward by   women, and it is all too seldom that our male society lends a   willing ear to the advice of women, no matter how well-founded it   may be. It would not be a bad thing if men would occasionally   remove their bland smiles and listen.    After the Zurich conference, Emily Balch stayed on in Geneva as   the secretary-general of the International Women’s League, a post   which she relinquished in 1922 because of ill health. In later   years she spent a large part of her time in this center of   international work.    A brief synopsis of her activity during these years cannot do   justice to all that she did. She took part in most of the nine   congresses of the Women’s League which were held in the period   between the wars, her influence being felt particularly in the   drafting of the resolutions. She organized several of the   conferences called by the Women’s League to study particular   questions such as modern methods of war, opium, the Austrian   problems, and minority questions. She took part in conferences   concerning stateless persons and the world economic crisis. Her   influence extended not only to these but also to numerous other   conferences not arranged by the Women’s League. She was in   continuous contact with the League of Nations throughout her stay   in Geneva, not only in connection with major political problems   but also in relation to everything which could serve   international cooperation. With her practical outlook, she   understood that improvement in political relations between   nations could be achieved by encouraging them to collaborate   regularly in specific fields.    Typical of her work on such questions, which form just one part   of the great problem of peace, are the efforts she made in 1921   in association with the American branch of the Women’s League, to   induce the United States to renounce its claim to priority for   its Austrian credits. Her efforts were to prove successful.   Another and even more typical example is her work in 1926 to   secure the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Haiti after eleven   years of occupation9. Once again   the initiative came from the Women’s League, and it was Emily   Balch who provided the driving force behind everything that was   achieved.    She never embarked on a campaign until she was sure of her facts.   She first traveled to Haiti with a delegation whose report, the   greater part of which she herself wrote, gives conclusive proof   of her ability to get to the root of the problem and of her   consummate skill in devising a practical and democratic solution   that would greatly benefit the people. These are aptitudes which   must surely be the envy of many a politician. Then came the   struggle to get the solution accepted. In the end the American   government carried out practically all the delegation’s   recommendations and withdrew its troops.    Now it would be a mistake to think that Emily Balch has worked   only through the medium of congresses and committees or through   the pressure she could exert on state authorities. One of the   first to realize the need for education and instruction, she   initiated the international summer schools run by the Women’s   League during the inter-war years. She herself taught at these   schools. But this is by no means all. In her extensive travels   throughout the world she sought first-hand knowledge of the   conditions of life wherever she was, meanwhile preaching the need   for international understanding. While in Egypt, she tried to   make contact with the women; in Palestine with the Jewish,   British, and Arab leaders; in England she gave a series of   lectures in support of the ratification of the Briand-Kellogg   Pact – to mention just a few examples. In addition she delivered   innumerable lectures in the United States on the subject of   internationalism and the League of Nations in her fight against   the isolationism which kept her own country at arm’s length from   the work of the League. She fought America’s passive attitude at   a time when it was vital to be active.    But the years passed and the disappointments multiplied, the   first being the Japanese occupation of Manchuria10; after that, one blow followed another. A   fresh world war loomed black upon the horizon. Yet men would not   understand that when violence takes the helm and the rule of law   is destroyed, then is the time to stand on guard.    The events of those years evoked a sharp reaction in Emily Balch.   She attacked isolationism and American neutrality legislation,   thereby placing herself for the first time in opposition to the   American branch of the Women’s League. And with the coming of   war, we no longer see her among the opponents of America’s entry   into the conflict as had been the case during the First World   War. We can say, perhaps, that this was the time when she parted   company from the absolute pacifists, the Quakers, the Fellowship of   Reconciliation, and the War Resisters League. She had to ask herself   the question which faced all those who had worked for peace:   Shall we submit meekly and allow ourselves to be devoured? I only   put the question. Let each man examine his own conscience and   find the answer.    Emily Balch found her answer, for she believed that if we did not   vanquish the evil we could not hope to achieve victory for the   ideas which she herself had championed for so many years.    Both before and during the war she worked enthusiastically for   the refugees who came to the United States, especially for the   Jews. But even at that time she was already looking ahead to the   problems which would follow in the wake of the war. Hers was not   just passive, armchair interest, for she personally drafted   proposals for peace terms, terms based not on unconditional   surrender but on the realistic view that the world would have to   be rebuilt. She also drafted proposals for a constructive   international settlement. She has given her loyal support to the   newly created United   Nations Organization and has brought all her influence to   bear on American peace organizations to enlist their support for   it, even if it does not now correspond perfectly with their   ideals. «For», she says, «the future shape of the   new organization will not depend upon what the documents appear   to state, but on what the members make of it. Practice in   cooperation is what will give the United Nations its character.   Plans have not been set up for a utopia but for Europe, Russia,   America, and all the other countries with their conflicting   interests and ideas. And it is precisely because the proposals we   have before us are fairly modest that they may perhaps be   realized.» We see here yet another instance of her practical   approach. A lifetime of experience has taught her how great the   difficulties are which lie ahead.    But now and again we espy a different approach to the coldly   calculating, realistic evaluation of the task before us. I cannot   refrain from quoting a few words in her own language:   «International unity is not in itself a solution. Unless   this international unity has a moral quality, accepts the   discipline of moral standards, and possesses the quality of   humanity, it will not be the unity we are interested   in.»    It is her basic conception that practical solutions, no matter   how refined technically, count for nothing if they are not   evolved from, or if they do not rest upon, an ethical foundation.   If the organization is autocratic in character, or if it is not   guided by the spirit of cooperation, then it is worse than   useless.    There are many who have shared this view in the past. They are   perhaps fewer in number today, for such thoughts are not   fashionable in this modern age. A dream, they cry. But isn’t life   empty and worthless without its dreams, even for practical   everyday work?    The name of Emily Balch may not be familiar to many of us here,   and there are probably few people in Europe who still remember   her now. The war has erased so many names. Being a modest person,   she was never one to seek the limelight even at the height of her   activity. What was said of Cordell   Hull last year is, I think, also true of her: she cares   little whether the credit goes to her or to someone else, as long   as the object in view has been attained.    Emily Balch has now reached old age but she remains active to the   last, and, as she herself said when being congratulated on her   seventy-fifth birthday: «I think I shall live for quite a   while yet, for, as my grandfather said, an old woman is as tough   as an old owl.» May her words prove to be no less than the   truth, for the world cannot boast of many persons of her   mettle.    Even if we cannot say to her: «Do you not smile on reaching   the goal?», that goal which is the guiding light of those   whose sights are set beyond the ending of each day, we can still   pay her homage and express our gratitude for her lifelong,   indefatigable work for the cause of peace. She has taught us that   the reality we seek must be earned by hard and unrelenting toil   in the world in which we live, but she has taught us more: that   exhaustion is unknown and defeat only gives fresh courage to the   man whose soul is fired by the sacred flame.    1.

He was born in Sullivan County in   the state of New York on May 25, 1865. It was assumed that he   would follow in the footsteps of his father, a timber merchant   engaged in transporting timber on the tributaries of the Delaware   River. But he was an avid reader, and the town’s Methodist   minister persuaded his parents to allow him to continue his   studies. For a long time the boy did not know what he wanted to   be. His father hoped that he would return to the timber trade,   while he himself vacillated between the church, law, and   politics. But during his years of study he was stirred by the   Gospel of Christ to mankind, and when the Y.M.C.A. asked him to   become a traveling secretary among the students of American and   Canadian universities he interpreted the offer as a call from the   Lord. He answered the call. It did not take him back to the   Delaware River. It sent him out into the wide world and it has   brought him here today.    Most of those who have received the Nobel Peace Prize bear names   which are well known from peace conferences, from congresses on   disarmament problems and arbitration treaties, or from their   handling of acute political situations when they were able to   play propitious roles in finding a solution to great and grievous   conflicts. But the venerable John Mott is among us today because   he has been faithful to the call which he answered as a young   student, and because he has created worldwide organizations which   have united millions of young people in work for the Christian   ideals of peace and tolerance between nations. He has never been   a politician, he has never taken an active part in organized   peace work. But he has always been a living force, a tireless   fighter in the service of Christ, opening young minds to the   light which he thinks can lead the world to peace and bring men   together in understanding and goodwill. His work has always been   chiefly among youth, for in them lies the key to the future. They   are the leaders of tomorrow. The spirit that moves the hearts of   the young will one day fashion the world. And the old John Mott   is still to be found in the midst of the young, a tireless   servant of his Master. His long life has brought him profound   disappointments. But they have never broken his spirit nor cooled   his ardor. He believes that good will triumph in the end, that   all the trials and struggles, all the disappointments and   defeats, must bring the fulfillment of the Christian promise that   all men shall become one. We need only be faithful to our call,   resolute in our confidence that someday the spirit of unremitting   service will see the seed sprout from the furrows of peace in a   world free from fear.    The young university man who traveled from college to college to   preach the word of God among the students felt a growing   awareness of the tasks and possibilities which lay ahead. He   understood that the frank and open comradeship which bound   together the Christian students at the American and Canadian   universities could become a mighty impulse for the whole world,   if only the circle of fellowship could be widened from country to   country. And he was to see his dream become reality. The World’s   Student Christian Federation was founded in 1895 under his   leadership at a meeting held in Vadstena Castle1. Following this happy event, Mott departed   on his first missionary journey. He wanted to organize student   associations all over the world. On this journey he visited   twenty-four countries, founded seventy new associations, created   national associations of Christian students in India, Ceylon, New   Zealand, Australia, China, and Japan, and selected corresponding   members of the world federation in Egypt, Hawaii, and in many   European countries. Since that trip he has gone round the world   on numerous occasions. Someone has calculated that he has covered   more than two million miles on his travels; that is equal to   seventy times the circumference of the earth!    Few men have traveled in so many countries, spoken to so many   people, and inspired so much confidence as has John Mott. He   never departed on one of his tours without adequate preparation.   When he was to visit a country, he first studied its culture, its   customs, its religious and political background. When he arrived,   he was able to talk with those he met as a friend who knew the   country, the people, and their way of life. His mind was always   receptive to new influences, to other ways of thinking and   feeling. He was never an American bringing an evangelical message   to Poland, to South America, or to the East, in an American   style. He was an apostle of a simple Christianity, presented in a   form which made it living and real to the people to whom it was   addressed. God is our Father, he said. But if God is our Father,   then we are all brothers, and no frontiers or racial divisions   can separate us from each other.    The students who flocked to Mott’s organization were not only   Protestants. They came from the Roman Catholic and Orthodox   churches, from the Thomist Christians in India, from the   Nestorian, Syrian, and Coptic churches. Mott’s aim was to give   the Christian world new leaders whose love and tolerance would   transcend the old frontiers which had previously separated   people. All races have a valuable contribution to bring to the   great spiritual community, he said, and all races and nations are   needed for Christ to reveal Himself in all His power and   glory.    Mott himself is a Methodist, but he never traveled as a   representative of any denomination. He worked among people of   every creed and race, and his help and advice were freely   available to all. He sought to make contact not only with   religious circles, but also with scientists, political leaders,   statesmen and, above all, with youth. His simple preaching was a   source of strength and inspiration to those whom he addressed or   with whom he talked; his powerful, tinselfish, and noble   character won him friends and followers and opened the way for   brotherhood between nations under the banner of Christ – always   the central theme of his preaching.    To his other qualities must be added that of great organizing   ability. The World’s Student Christian Federation which he had   founded at Vadstena grew under his guidance into a mighty   organization, with hundreds of thousands of members in over forty   countries. He organized a series of world conferences of   Christian students, the best known being the Tokyo Conference of   1907, which marked the movement’s breakthrough in the Far   East.    The work of the organization, its program, and the resolutions   which it sent out into the world bore the imprint of his forceful   personality. We Christian students, states one such resolution,   believe in the fundamental equality of all races and nations, and   we consider it a part of our Christian duty to give expression to   this principle in our relations with people. We also believe it   to be our absolute duty to use all our efforts to combat   everything which can lead to war and to combat war itself as a   means of resolving international disputes.    The work of Mott and his student movement in the cause of peace,   goodwill, and understanding between nations was a natural   corollary of his view of Christ as the Prince of Peace. The   movement’s motto had at one time been «Make Christ   King». And this summarizes Mott’s feelings. Christ was the   King he served, and the fight he waged was a fight to win the   world for the peace which his King wanted to give to   mankind.    For over thirty years Mott was the organizer and leader of   Christian students. But at the same time he has for decades been   a prominent figure in the Y.M.C.A., the organization which first   called him to the service of youth, and in 1926 he became   president of the World’s Alliance of Young Men’s Christian   Associations. This organization is run along lines similar to   those of the Student Federation but is much broader in character.   Its membership, drawn from every social class and occupation,   numbers two million boys and young men from more than fifty   countries. It represents autonomous national organizations all   over the world and of every Christian denomination. It arranges   exchange of delegates and publications, sets up study groups and   international and ecumenical meetings, and tries through planned   activities to find constructive solutions to the problem of peace   between nations.    John Mott is still at the head of the World’s Alliance, still its   fountain of strength and inspiration. His outstanding organizing   ability and uncanny resourcefulness in the raising of funds for   the member associations have materially assisted them in   accomplishing extensive humanitarian work over and above their   contribution in the spiritual domain. When most international   organizations were disintegrating during the First World War,   Mott was gathering together the resources of his organizations in   a mighty effort to span the abyss of hatred of those days by   launching welfare work among the soldiers at the front and by   bringing relief to millions of prisoners of war on both sides. He   himself was always on the move, traveling from country to country   and visiting the fronts, entering into negotiations with   statesmen in belligerent as well as in neutral states, recruiting   suitable helpers for this vast project, for which he collected no   less than 250 million dollars. His men worked unceasingly to   render captivity mentally and physically bearable for the   prisoners of war, trying to prepare them for a return to normal   life after the war, free of the bitterness that war and   imprisonment engender, so that collaboration between nations   could once again become possible.    It was one of the greatest works of peace ever carried out in the   entire history of war, wrote President   Taft, adding that it was chiefly due to Mott’s organizing   genius and inspiring leadership.    After the Armistice, Mott’s attention and energy turned to the   demobilized men, and to such good effect that thousands of young   men were saved from physical and moral ruin. It is a powerful   testimony to Mott’s outstanding organizing ability and zeal that   he and his assistants were invited to conduct the work of   rehabilitation in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Bulgaria,   Rumania, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.    During World War II, the Y.M.C.A., with Mott still at the helm,   resumed its gigantic operation to improve conditions in the   prisoner-of-war camps. With the coming of peace, Mott, disdainful   of his eighty years, once more set forth on his worldwide travels   to reforge the international links which the war had broken and   to arrange the first world conference of his organization. This   conference was held in Geneva last summer under Mott’s   chairmanship.    But it is not only international work among Christian youth of   all lands which has profited from Mott’s great powers of   leadership. For a whole generation he has also been a leading   figure in ecumenical work. At the World Missionary Conference   held in Edinburgh in 1910, the Protestant churches of Europe,   North America, and Australia entrusted to Mott the guidance of   their international activities. Subsequently, Mott also brought   the churches of Africa, Asia, and South America into this   association. He also founded and presided over the International   Missionary Council and the Institute of Social and Religious   Research.    Under Mott’s leadership at the World Missionary Congress at   Jerusalem in 1928, representatives of European and American   churches met with representatives of Christian churches from the   Muslim world, the Dutch and British Indies, from China,   Turkestan, Persia, Iraq, Arabia, and Africa. The conference   adopted a detailed and constructive racial program, embodying a   code for the protection of the native against economic and social   injustice, as well as plans intended to prevent friction between   nations pursuing a policy of economic expansion. In 1938 he   presided over the third World Congress of the International   Missionary Council at Tambaram in India.    Mott has worked tirelessly in all parts of the world to combat   racial prejudice. He is perhaps better acquainted with this   problem than anyone because he has been everywhere, has talked   with all manner of people, and has systematically studied the   conditions in all the countries he has visited.    Wang, who has four times been China’s foreign   minister2, says that in many   crises in the Far East, when international complications could   have led to serious conflicts, Mott exercised all his influence   to bring about a peaceful solution.    In 1913 President Wilson, who   had an unbounded confidence in Mott’s character and skill, tried   to persuade him to accept the post of ambassador to China because   he was familiar with the people and the conditions in that   country and because many of the men who were most active in   setting up the new government and establishing a new regime in   China were his friends and helpers in the Y.M.C.A. movement. But   Mott declined. He had to remain true to his vocation. He wanted   to advance his work for peace through the many international   organizations of which he was president. «I do not know when   I have been so disappointed», remarked Wilson when he   received Mott’s refusal.    When a serious conflict arose between the United States and   Mexico in 1916, President Wilson appointed Mott a member of the   delegation which he sent to Mexico, and it was quite in keeping   with Mott’s reputation that the press should interpret his   appointment as an outstretched hand to Mexico. Nor is it unlikely   that his intimate familiarity with Mexican conditions and his   will for peace had a decisive influence on the successful outcome   of the negotiations.    The following year Mott was a member of the American diplomatic   mission to Russia. His German friends later reproached him for   having taken part in this mission, but his assignment was in no   way political, and it is a remarkable tribute to the high regard   in which he was held that the Germans afterwards agreed to   express their confidence in the integrity of Mott’s motives, even   though they would have preferred his relinquishing his   international position before taking the trip.    Mott’s work to subdue racial antagonism was a link in the chain   of peace which he tried to forge around the world. But it was   more than that. It was also an endeavor to impart dignity to the   relations between human beings within individual nations. In his   own country, the United States, he has performed great work on   behalf of the Negroes. To fight prejudices which exist in one’s   own society makes a bigger demand perhaps on a man’s personality   and strength of character than any other endeavor. Mott was the   driving spirit in the movement to form associations in the   southern states comprising both white and colored members, the   leading men of both races representing a variety of professions.   His aim was to bring about a relaxation of the existing racial   tension. In 1914 he presided over the first Christian student   conference for Negroes ever held in the United States. During the   same year, and also for the first time in American history, a   congress was held under Mott’s chairmanship of both black and   white Christians from northern and southern states. If we are   Christians, said Mott in his closing address, we must be able to   live side by side as true friends, in equality, justice, and   mutual respect.    This is the principle that has governed all of Mott’s work among   the different churches and missions, among races and nations. The   three great world organizations which have flourished under his   leadership for a generation – the Student Federation, the Young   Men’s Christian Association, and the International Missionary   Council – have in his hands been instruments for creating that   spirit of Christian tolerance and love which can give peace to   the world.    Elihu Root, himself a Nobel   Peace Prize winner and at one time American secretary of state,   has said about Mott: «His powerful personality and   completely self-sacrificing devotion to the cause of peace, have,   I believe, never been equaled. He does not owe his influence to   the official positions he holds; rather, it is the positions   which have acquired importance through the work he has   accomplished. Over the years he has traveled over the whole   world, using his official position to create and strengthen a   universal sympathy for the fundamental ideas on which peace   necessarily depends.»    Disraeli3 once said that it is a   magnificent sight to see a nation saved by its youth. But is it   not even more magnificent, says Mott, to see the student youth of   all nations and races stand together in the struggle to maintain   the high ideals of international peace and goodwill?    Many eminent men and women, idealists worthy of our admiration,   have done outstanding work in establishing peace and promoting   general acceptance of arbitration agreements between governments,   in organizing international courts and building up the League of   Nations or the United   Nations. Mott has not done that. But he has tried to create   the climate in which the work for peace can grow in strength and   security.    He himself once expressed it this way: Let us always attach   importance to arbitration agreements and other international   regulations, to peace and arbitration conferences, to publicity   campaigns on these vital questions, and to the display of sound   practical judgment on these matters; but let us also be of one   mind on the most fundamental issue of all, that which will give   life and effectiveness to all the rest, that which alone can   create and preserve the climate in which international   arbitration can exist, that which will make it effective or, even   better, superfluous – and that is to create the right atmosphere,   the right frame of heart and mind, to instill the right spirit in   the lives of nations.    Mott’s work has been devoted to the most fundamental issue of   all. He has gone out into the whole world and opened hearts to   the idea of peace, to understanding, love, and tolerance. He has   done it in answer to a call from God and, guided by that call, he   has prepared the soil in which the hope of the world will   grow.    1. In Sweden.    2.

"26","1947","Friends Service Council, American Friends Service Committee","   The Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament has awarded this year’s Peace Prize to the Quakers, represented by their two great relief organizations, the Friends Service Council in London and the American Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia. It is now three hundred years since George Fox1 established the Society of Friends. It was during the time of civil war in England, a period full of the religious and political strife which led to the Protectorate under Cromwell2 – today we would no doubt call it a dictatorship. What then happened was what so often happens when a political or religious movement is successful; it lost sight of its original concern: the right to freedom. For, having achieved power, the movement then refuses to grant to others the things for which it has itself fought. Such was the case with the Presbyterians and after them with the Independents. It was not the spirit of tolerance and humanity that emerged victorious. George Fox and many of his followers were to experience this during the ensuing years, but they did not take up the fight by arming, as men customarily do. They went their way quietly because they were opposed to all forms of violence. They believed that spiritual weapons would prevail in the long run – a belief born of inward experience. They emphasized life itself rather than its forms because forms, theories, and dogmas have never been of importance to them. They have therefore from the very beginning been a community without fixed organization. This has given them an inner strength and a freer view of mankind, a greater tolerance toward others than is found in most organized religious communities. The Quaker movement originated in England, but soon afterwards in 1656, the Quakers found their way to America where they were not at first welcomed. In spite of persecution, however, they stood fast and became firmly established during the last quarter of the century. Everyone has heard of the Quaker, William Penn3, who founded Philadelphia and the colony of Pennsylvania. Around 1700 there were already fifty to sixty thousand Quakers in America and about the same number in England. Since then the Quakers have lived their own lives, many of them having to suffer for their beliefs. Much has changed during these three hundred years. Outward customs, such as the dress adopted by the early Quakers, have been discarded, and the Friends themselves now live in a society which is outwardly quite different from that of the seventeenth century. But the people around them are the same, and what has to be conquered within man himself is no less formidable. The Society of Friends has never had many members, scarcely more than 200,000 in the entire world, the majority living in the United States and in England. But it is not the number that matters. What counts more is their inner strength and their deeds. If we study the history of the Quakers, we cannot but admire the strength they have acquired through their faith and through their efforts to live up to that faith in their daily life. They have always been opposed to violence in any form, and many considered their refusal to take part in wars the most important tenet of their religion. But it is not quite so simple. It is certainly true that the Declaration of 1660 states: «We utterly deny all outward wars and strife and fightings with outward weapons, for any end and under any pretence whatsoever. And this is our testimony to the whole world.» But that goes much further than a refusal to take part in war. It leads to this: it is better to suffer injustice than to commit injustice. It is from within man himself that victory must in the end be gained. It may be said, without doing injustice to anyone, that the Quakers have at times been more interested in themselves and in their inner life than in the community in which they lived. There was, as one of their own historians has said, something passive about their work: they preferred to be counted among the silent in the land. But no one can fulfill his mission in this life by wanting to belong only to the silent ones and to live his own life isolated from others. Nor was this attitude true of the Quakers. They too went out among men, not to convert them, but to take an active part with them in the life of the community and, even more, to offer their help to those who needed it and to let their good deeds speak for themselves in appealing for mutual understanding. Here I can only mention some scattered examples which illustrate such activity. The Quakers took part in creating the first peace organization in 1810 and since then have participated in all active peace movements. I would mention Elizabeth Fry 4, John Woolman5, and other Quakers active in the fight against slavery and in the struggle for social justice. I would mention the liberal idealist John Bright6, his forty-year fight against the principles of war and for the principles of peace, his opposition to the Crimean War7, and his struggle against Palmerston’s8 policies. Many other examples could be mentioned to show how their active participation in community work, in politics if you prefer, increased during the nineteenth century. Yet it is not this side of their activities – the active political side – which places the Quakers in a unique position. It is through silent assistance from the nameless to the nameless that they have worked to promote the fraternity between nations cited in the will of Alfred Nobel. Their work began in the prisons. We heard about them from our seamen who spent long years in prison during the Napoleonic Wars9. We met them once again during the Irish famine of 1846-1847. When English naval units bombarded the Finnish coast during the Crimean War10, the Quakers hurried there to heal the wounds of war, and we found them again in France after the ravages of the 1870-1871 war11. When the First World War broke out, the Quakers were once more to learn what it was to suffer for their faith. They refused to carry arms, and many of them were thrown into prison, where they were often treated worse than criminals. But it is not this that we shall remember longest. We who have closely observed the events of the First World War and of the inter-war period will probably remember most vividly the accounts of the work they did to relieve the distress caused by the war. As early as 1914, the English Quakers started preparation for relief action. They began their work in the Marne district in France and, whenever they could, they went to the very places where the war had raged. They worked in this way all through the war and when it ended were confronted by still greater tasks. For then, as now, hunger and sickness followed in the wake of the war. Who does not recall the years of famine in Russia in 1920-1921 and Nansen‘s appeal to mankind for help? Who does not recall the misery among the children in Vienna which lasted for years on end? In the midst of the work everywhere were the Quakers. It was the Friends Service Committee which, at Hoover’s12 request, took on the mighty task of obtaining food for sick and undernourished children in Germany. Their relief corps worked in Poland and Serbia, continued to work in France, and later during the civil war in Spain13 rendered aid on both sides of the front. Through their work, the Quakers won the confidence of all, for both governments and people knew that their only purpose was to help. They did not thrust themselves upon people to win them to their faith. They drew no distinction between friend and foe. One expression of this confidence was the donation of considerable funds to the Quakers by others. The funds which the Quakers could have raised among themselves would not have amounted to much since most of them are people of modest means. During the period between the wars their social work also increased in scope. Although, in one sense, nothing new emerged, the work assumed a form different from that of the wartime activity because of the nature of the problems themselves. Constructive work received more emphasis, education and teaching played a greater part, and there were now more opportunities of making personal contact with people than there had been during a time when the one necessity seemed to be to supply food and clothing. The success achieved among the coal miners in West Virginia provides an impressive example of this work. The Quakers solved the housing problems, provided new work for the unemployed, created a new little community. In the words of one of their members, they succeeded in restoring self-respect and confidence in life to men for whom existence had become devoid of hope. This is but one example among many. The Second World War did not strike the Quakers personally in the same way as did that of 1914. Both in England and in the U.S.A. the conscription laws allowed the Quakers to undertake relief work instead of performing military service; so they were neither cast into prison nor persecuted because of their unwillingness to go to war. In this war there were, moreover, Quakers who did not refuse to take an active part in the war, although they were few compared with those who chose to help the victims of war. When war came, the first task which confronted them was to help the refugees. But the difficulties were great because the frontiers of many countries were soon closed. The greater part of Europe was rapidly occupied by the Germans, and the United States remained neutral for only a short time. Most of the countries occupied by the Germans were closed to the Quakers. In Poland, it is true, they were given permission to help, but only on condition that the Germans themselves should choose who was to be helped, a condition which the Quakers could not accept. Nevertheless, they worked where they could, first undertaking welfare work in England and after that, behind the front in many countries of Europe and Asia, and even in America. For when America joined the war, the whole Japanese-American population, numbering 112,000 in all, of whom 80,000 were American citizens, was evacuated from the West Coast. The Quakers went to their assistance, as well as opposed the prevailing anti-Japanese feeling from which these people suffered. Now, with the war over, the need for help is greater than ever. This is true not only in Europe, but also and to the same degree in large areas of Asia. The problems are becoming more and more overwhelming – the prisoners who were released from concentration camps in 1945, all those who had to be repatriated from forced labor or POW camps in enemy countries, all the displaced persons who have no country to which they can return, all the homeless in their own countries, all the orphans, the hungry, the starving! The problem is not merely one of providing food and clothing, it is one of bringing people back to life and work, of restoring their self-respect and their faith and confidence in the future. Once again, the Quakers are active everywhere. As soon as a country has been reopened they have been on the spot, in Europe and in Asia, among countrymen and friends as well as among former enemies, in France and in Germany, in India and in Japan. It is not easy to assess the extent of their contribution. It is not something that can be measured in terms of money alone, but perhaps some indication of it may be given by the fact that the American Committee’s budget for last year was forty-six million Norwegian kroner. And this is only the sum which the American Committee has had at its disposal. Quakers in all countries have also taken a personal and active part in the work of other relief organizations. They have, for instance, assisted in the work of UNRRA14 in a number of places such as Vienna and Greece. Today the Quakers are engaged in work that will continue for many years to come. But to examine in closer detail the individual relief schemes would not give us any deeper insight into its significance. For it is not in the extent of their work or in its practical form that the Quakers have given most to the people they have met. It is in the spirit in which this work is performed. «We weren’t sent out to make converts», a young Quaker says: «we’ve come out for a definite purpose, to build up in a spirit of love what has been destroyed in a spirit of hatred. We’re not missionaries. We can’t tell if even one person will be converted to Quakerism. Things like that don’t happen in a hurry. When our work is finished it doesn’t mean that our influence dies with it. We have not come out to show the world how wonderful we are. No, the thing that seems most important is the fact that while the world is waging a war in the name of Christ, we can bind up the wounds of war in the name of Christ. Religion means very little until it is translated into positive action.»15 This is the message of good deeds, the message that men can find each other in spite of war, in spite of differences in race. Is it not here that we have the hope of laying foundations for peace among nations, of building it up in man himself so that the settling of disputes by force becomes impossible? All of us know that we have not yet traveled far along this road. And yet – when we witness today the great willingness to help those who have suffered, a generosity unknown before the war and often greatest among those who have least, can we not hope that there is something in the heart of man on which we can build, that we can one day reach our goal if only it be possible to make contact with people in all lands? The Quakers have shown us that it is possible to translate into action what lies deep in the hearts of many: compassion for others and the desire to help them – that rich expression of the sympathy between all men, regardless of nationality or race, which, transformed into deeds, must form the basis for lasting peace. For this reason alone the Quakers deserve to receive the Nobel Peace Prize today. But they have given us something more: they have shown us the strength to be derived from faith in the victory of the spirit over force. And this brings to mind two verses from one of Arnulf Överland’s16 poems which helped so many of us during the war. I know of no better salute: The unarmed only

"27","1949","Lord Boyd Orr"," Lord Boyd Orr occupies a unique place among   the many men and women who have received the Peace Prize over the   years. For while most others have been statesmen or politicians,   or international lawyers, or persons associated with peace   organizations, John Boyd Orr is not an international lawyer, nor   a politician, nor a statesman, nor can it even be said that he   has been an active participant in peace organizations for long   periods in his life. His work has been devoted to the study of   nutrition, the diet of animals and men.    But however great his scientific contributions may have been,   they alone would not have earned him the Peace Prize, for   scientific discoveries cannot, in themselves, create peace. It is   only when they are employed to promote cooperation between   nations that they become a valuable factor in the cause of peace.   For John Boyd Orr the purpose of his scientific work is to find   ways of making men healthier and happier so as to secure peace;   he believes that healthy and happy men have no need to resort to   arms in order to expand and acquire living space. «We   must», to quote his own words, «conquer hunger and   want, because hunger and want in the midst of plenty are a fatal   flaw and a blot on our civilization. They are one of the   fundamental causes of war. But it is no use trying to build the   new world from the top down, with political ideas of spheres of   influence and so on. We have to build it from the bottom upwards,   and provide first the primary necessities of life for the people   who have never had them, and build from the slums of this country   upwards.»1 Elsewhere he   says: «Agreements between nations not to go to war have   never lasted, and will never be enough to maintain the peace. The   nations must construct peace through daily cooperation, with a   positive goal in view, a goal which is seen to be mutually   advantageous. Only this can remove the principal causes of   war.» For Boyd Orr, Roosevelt’s words «freedom from   want»2 have become the very   foundation of peace between nations.    John Boyd Orr is first of all a realist as all of his work   testifies. Born in 1880, he is descended from a Scottish farming   family and has strong roots in farming life and practical   agriculture. But apart from being a farmer, he is a university   professor and a scientist. He began his medical studies at the   University of   Glasgow, later qualifying as a doctor. His scientific turn of   mind prompted him to take an early interest in research, and the   first problem to claim his attention was that of the nutrition of   domestic animals. In 1914 he was appointed director of the   Institute of Animal Nutrition in Aberdeen.    His work, however, was interrupted by the First World War in   which he served as a doctor. After the war, in 1919, he became   director of the Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen, a position he   held until 1945 when he became professor of agriculture at   Aberdeen   University. That same year he became director general of the   Food and Agriculture   Organization of the United Nations, better known as the FAO, a post he   relinquished last year.    During his term of office at the Rowett Institute, Boyd Orr laid   the foundations for the agricultural and nutritional policies   which he was later to pursue in the FAO. He published an   impressive number of papers while he was director of the Rowett   Institute, confining his work until 1928 to studies on the   nutrition of domestic animals. His first work devoted to human   nutrition, Milk Consumption and the Growth of School   Children, which appeared in 1928, was based on dietary   experiments carried out among schoolchildren in the mining   districts. This publication marked the beginning of a whole   series of papers dealing with the subject of the human diet:   Diet and Illness, Diet, Health and Agriculture, and many   others. In 1936 he published Food, Health and Income, a   work which more than any other helped to stimulate discussion of   nutritional problems and to lay the foundation for a positive   nutritional policy.    The originality of this investigation lay neither in its method   nor in its general findings concerning the consumption of food in   relation to different income groups. Earlier research carried out   in this field in several countries had revealed that a greater   proportion of the income in lower income groups was spent on food   and that the nature of the diet varied from one income group to   another. But this had become dead knowledge and was not used when   it came to formulating nutritional policy.    What was original in Boyd Orr’s research was the fact that, by   analyzing the composition of the diet, he was able to indicate   its nutritive value for each income group. Furthermore, he   calculated the nutritional level of the various income groups for   the whole British population. His results were so surprising they   created a sensation. They showed that even in Great Britain,   where the standard of living was higher than in most countries,   the diet of a very large part of the population was inferior to   that accepted by nutritional physiologists as adequate. Boyd Orr   showed that a substantial increase in agricultural production was   essential if the population was to receive reasonable   nourishment. An increase in agricultural production would be of   considerable benefit for, by providing improved nourishment for   the population, it would enable the population in its turn to   raise productivity in general. What had to be done, therefore,   was to formulate and put into practice a policy which would   satisfy these two requisites.    It is no coincidence that Boyd Orr thereafter devoted himself to   the coordination of agricultural and nutritional policies, not   only in order to free mankind from want, but also to create a   basis for peaceful cooperation between classes, nations, and   races. Originally, it was no doubt his deep compassion for those   living in poverty – as a doctor he had seen many of them in the   slums of Glasgow – that induced him to study the problems of   human nutrition. He had been acquainted with agriculture since   childhood and as early as the 1920’s he was keenly aware of the   importance of having an efficient, rational husbandry together   with a food policy which would bring agricultural produce within   reach of everyone’s pocket. He has always been opposed to any   agricultural policy based on restricted production.    Continuing to develop his ideas, he gave them concrete expression   in a proposal he put forward when he became secretary of the   Scottish Committee of 1932, established by the National Council   for the Development of Scotland. These were the ideas which later   prevailed when it came to the framing of a food policy for Great   Britain.    Boyd Orr’s ideas have left their mark on British agricultural and   food policies. Had his work stopped there, it would have been of   little or no importance to international cooperation. But his   ideas soon spread beyond the boundaries of Great Britain, for   agricultural and nutritional problems exist in every country,   today as always in the past.    Yet the propagation of an idea does not necessarily mean that it   will determine the solution of problems. The problems of   nutrition were left untackled until the harsh reality of the   period following the First World War impelled responsible men to   seek an answer. For the world was facing a situation in which   famine was decimating entire populations while agricultural   crises were arising from overabundance of agricultural produce   which those who needed it were unable to purchase. And at the   same time the people in some of the agricultural countries could   not afford to buy the products of their industrial counterparts   because the farmers were too poor.    This was one of the problems highlighted at the World Economic   Conference held at Geneva in 1927, but no further progress was   made at that time. It was not until 1934, upon the initiative of   Australian High Commissioner Stanley Bruce, that the League of   Nations Assembly took up the question, appointing an   international committee of nutritional physiologists to establish   the food requirements of the world. Boyd Orr was a member of this   committee, which presented its report3 in 1936. Later in the same year a committee   composed of nutritional physiologists, agricultural experts, and   economists was asked to investigate the relationships among diet,   health, agriculture, and economics. Although Boyd Orr was not a   member of this latter committee, he exerted considerable   influence on its work. The report4 was submitted in 1937. However, the Second   World War broke out soon afterwards, bringing these efforts of   the League of Nations to an end.    War gives little opportunity for international cooperation, but   it often happens in an individual country that things which would   seem impossible in peacetime manage to get done in time of war.   And so it was on this occasion. By means of rationing and other   appropriate economic measures, the British people were given as   adequate a diet as can be provided in a time of scarcity. This   application of Boyd Orr’s ideas resulted in a far higher level of   health among the population than anyone had expected.    This was a step forward. But more important still was the fact   that, even in time of war, there were men whose eyes were turned   toward the future, men who could plan for the postwar era when   the devastation of war could be repaired and the world led   forward once again along the path of peace. Boyd Orr was such a   man. In 1942 he visited the United States as a private individual   to canvass support for his ideas. There can be no doubt that the   Hot Springs Conference held in the spring of 1943 was strongly   influenced by his views. The conference endorsed the necessity of   coordinating food and agricultural policies, and proposed the   creation of an international organization to study these   questions. The problems that would need an immediate solution   after the end of the war were defined, as was the policy which   would have to be pursued if the whole world were eventually to be   freed from want. The resolutions of the conference were wholly in   accordance with the line taken by Boyd Orr.    The organization proposed at Hot Springs, the FAO, was launched   at a conference in Quebec in the autumn of 1945. Boyd Orr, who   took part in this conference, was appointed director-general of   the organization. It was this post which gave him the opportunity   to make his most valuable contribution in the international   field.    Boyd Orr regarded the establishment of this organization as one   of the most important steps that had ever been taken to construct   a better world and to lay the foundation of a lasting peace. In   his own words: «All nations must accept the responsibility   of assuring their own people the food which is necessary to   maintain life and health. Governments must cooperate to ensure   that this goal is attained by people in all countries. This is   the first step on the road to fulfilling the Atlantic Charter’s   promise of freedom from want.»    One of the most important tasks of the FAO after the war was to   ensure an equitable distribution among the nations of the world   of the food products which were in short supply. The   International Emergency Food Council set up for this purpose was   a kind of international rationing directorate whose operations   continued until the summer of 1949. This rationing arrangement   was undoubtedly responsible for preventing the famine which   threatened many countries in the postwar period.    But such work does not constitute the main responsibility of the   FAO. Its most important function is to assist agricultural   development and the production of nutritional raw materials in   all countries of the world. Under Boyd Orr’s direction the FAO   has become the most efficient organization in this field. It has   taken up a series of technical and economic problems which must   be solved before any real progress in the development of   agriculture can be made. In numerous ways it has assisted the   introduction of new farming methods. This is in itself a vast   undertaking, for not only is it necessary to teach farmers modern   methods, it is also necessary to make their adoption economically   feasible. All this can be difficult enough in countries where   agriculture has reached a comparatively advanced stage of   development. But anyone who is at all familiar with the methods   practiced in the more primitive countries, to the detriment of   both the farmers themselves and of the world, will readily   appreciate the enormity of the task. And it is precisely in those   countries that action is most needed.    But Boyd Orr did not stop at that. For it was not enough merely   to increase agricultural production; it was essential also to   arrest sharp fluctuations in prices and to prevent the   accumulation of surpluses which remained unsold. He had himself   lived through the 1930’s. «Governments must», he says,   «ensure the existence of a market with reasonable prices,   not just for the sake of the farmers but because it is to the   benefit of commerce, industry, and the whole people».   Accordingly, he proposed the creation of a World Food Board which   would assume wide responsibilities. It was to stabilize food   prices on the world markets, to create reserves of food to meet   shortages and to counteract increases in price in the event that   harvests should fail, to raise capital to finance the sale of   surpluses to countries with the greatest need, and finally to   cooperate with organizations such as the World Bank, which   could provide credit for the development of agriculture,   industry, and the economy as a whole, with a view to more rapid   progress toward the appointed goal.    The World Food Board, which was to be invested with strong   executive power, never became reality. It was too big a step to   be taken all at once. In its stead the World Food Council, an   advisory body with no executive authority, was established within   the framework of FAO.    In the summer of 1948 Boyd Orr resigned his position as   director-general of the FAO, but this is not to say that he has   retired from active life. He has continued to work for his ideas   which have gradually become more and more comprehensive in scope.   In his early years he began the study of agricultural problems,   approaching the subject from the point of view of a farmer and of   a nutritional physiologist. Even as a young man he investigated   the relationships among men’s diet, their health, and their life.   He saw the connection between agriculture, which provides the   means, and human beings, who should use these means to improve   their health and standard of living. He fought for his ideas   first in his own country, Scotland, and in England. But he   reached out beyond national boundaries and embarked on   international work under the auspices of the League of Nations.   And so, after the last war, the opportunity came his way of   devoting some years to laying the foundation of the organization   which should turn his ideas into reality.    Boyd Orr never loses sight of the principal objective. He   emphasizes more and more strongly how important international   cooperation in economic matters is for peace and he attaches more   and more weight to promoting rapid economic progress in the   underdeveloped countries. He says: «This will increase   productivity and purchasing power and create wider markets for   both agriculture and industry. Such a development is not only   necessary to the welfare of countless human beings, but also to   the continued existence of our scientific and technological   civilization, and to the establishment of a lasting   peace.»    He points out that science, which has placed in our hands the   means of achieving every possible technical advance, has brought   people closer together in a way which today renders geographical   distances meaningless. But at the same time there continue to   exist national economic systems still isolated from each other as   if nothing has happened; indeed, our twentieth century sees them   more isolated than in the past. If I have understood Boyd Orr   correctly, it is what we might call the tension resulting from   the disparity between the standards of living in different   countries that is now the great danger, a danger which could   trigger a new war.    And what is the position today? The greater part of the   population of the world lives in countries which are economically   underdeveloped. The population of these countries is increasing   more rapidly than ever before because medical science is now able   to counteract the vast epidemics of former ages. But a primitive   economy cannot support a growing population which in many places   now lives on the brink of famine. In contrast to these countries   we have those with a sound economy and a low birthrate. In these   countries the standard of living of the population as a whole has   improved and continues to rise steadily.    This disparity creates tension between countries which is felt   all the more these days now that progress in communication has   brought nations closer together. Conditions in the wealthier   countries have also become better known to the rest of the world   since many citizens of underdeveloped countries have been   pursuing their education in Europe or in the United States.   Having once seen how people can live, these citizens naturally   determine that their own countries should reach a similar   standard in a very short time. Unless we devote all our resources   to help the economy of these backward countries, the tension may   one day build up to the point of explosion.    Boyd Orr has realized this perhaps more clearly than most men,   and it has been his life’s work to find ways to reduce this   tension. Being the realist that he is, he has laid plans on the   material and practical level: «Let nations get together and   discuss concrete, practical questions which they understand are   for the benefit of mankind; then they can talk and reach   agreement. If they start by discussing frontiers and spheres of   influence, they will never succeed.»    This thought is similar to that which Jane Addams, also a winner of the Peace   Prize, expresses in her book Peace and Bread, when she   says: «A genuine Society of Nations may finally be evolved   by millions of earth’s humblest toilers, whose lives are consumed   in securing the daily needs of existence for themselves and their   families.»    Boyd Orr has never forgotten how the average man thinks and   feels. He knows the farmer too well for that. He knows that the   man in the street hates war and all it stands for. He hates it   too, and as the years have passed, the idea of peace has gained   an increasingly greater hold over him. In 1945 he was elected   president of the National Peace Council, which represents more   than fifty British peace organizations, and this year he has   accepted the post of president of the new World Union of Peace   Organizations. He is also president of the World Movement for   World Federal Government.    His membership in these peace organizations is fully consistent   with all his other activity. He has always been opposed to those   who attach too much significance to national frontiers, those who   place their sovereign rights above all else. He never resorts to   grand words when talking of peace. What he says is plain and   simple.    But his accomplishment is immense. Few can claim to have planned   and carried through a work as important to the human race as his,   a work which clearly paves the way for peace.    For this great work in the service of mankind which, once begun,   can never be halted, he richly merits the Nobel Peace Prize.    1.

"28","1950","Ralph Bunche","   Dr. Ralph Bunche was born forty-six years ago in Detroit in the United States. So today he is still a young man and indeed, along with Mr. Carl von Ossietzky, the youngest to be awarded the Peace Prize. Consequently, while most laureates have left their best years behind them, Dr. Bunche can still look forward to a long period of active life. At the same time he can also look back on years of persevering toil devoted to the unremitting campaign to develop, as he says, man’s ability to live in peace, harmony, and mutual understanding with his fellows. The life story of Dr. Bunche is like that of many another American youth. Born and brought up in difficult circumstances, he had to go to work at an early age, becoming an errand boy at seven, and at twelve working long hours in a bakery, often until eleven or twelve o’clock at night. It was at this time that both of his parents died, and his old grandmother Nana took him and the other children to Los Angeles. Here young Ralph’s life was divided between school and work, for he had to work in order to live. But again Ralph Bunche was no exception, for, as he recalls, seventy percent of the students at the University of California were obliged to do the same. Such a life can bee hard on the young, but it can also serve to develop the strength of character necessary for making one’s way in life and meeting the problems one faces. In 1927 Bunche passed his examinations at the University of Califomia, and in that same year started his studies at Harvard where, in 1934, he took his doctorate in political science. From 1928 until 1938 he was an instructor, and from 1938 until 1941 a professor, at Howard University in Washington It was during these years that Bunche began to study colonial and racial problems. In 1936 he received a grant from the Social Science Research Council to examine colonial policy and the position of non-European peoples in South Africa. But before setting out for Africa, where he was to stay in Cape Town and later visit the African tribes, he prepared himself for the work ahead by study in London. Bunche became one of Gunnar Myrdal‘s closest collaborators in his study of the American Negro1. He soon caught the attention of the American administration which, in 1941, gave him a post in the Office of Strategic Services as an expert in colonial affairs. Later, in 1944, he was appointed territorial specialist in colonial affairs under the State Department, and in 1945 became head of this division. He was at this time, as he himself points out, the first Negro to reach a position of such responsibility in the American administration. On repeated occasions he was sent as an official representative to international conferences: Dumbarton Oaks in 1944, the International Labor Conference in Philadelphia in 1945, the Constituent Assembly of the United Nations in San Francisco the same year. He was also a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations conference in London in 1945 and in 1946, as well as being among the representatives to the 1946 ILO Conference in Paris. It was in 1946 also that he was appointed director of the Trusteeship Department of the United Nations Secretariat. These are the highlights of his remarkable career. But they give little insight into the man himself. For Bunche, as for most of us, the early years – before we acquire the knowledge and experience that life and work give – were the formative ones. Looking back on his childhood, Bunche can remember no time when his family lived in conditions other than those of extreme poverty. But it was not poverty which made him the man we know today; for in the midst of this poverty was that highly gifted woman, his grandmother Nana. He tells of his childhood, when his grandmother and her four adult children, with their families, all lived under the same roof. It was a closely knit, matriarchal family, in which the grandmother was the dominant personality. A woman who had been born into slavery, she must have been a truly extraordinary person, and she unquestionably contributed more than anyone else to the molding of young Ralph’s character. «But life was no idyll», says Bunche. «I was learning what it meant to be a Negro, even in an enlightened Northern city.» «But», he continues later, «I wasn’t embittered by such experiences, for Nana had taught me to fight without rancor. She taught all of us to stand up for our rights, to suffer no indignity, but to harbor no bitterness toward anyone, as this would only warp our personalities. Deeply religious, she instilled in us a sense of personal pride strong enough to sustain all external shocks, but she also taught us understanding and tolerance.»2 It was a valuable heritage that Nana bequeathed to Bunche, one which was to help him enormously throughout his life. He, in turn, has tried to pass it on to his own children. He says: «In rearing my children I have passed on the philosophy that Nana taught me as a youngster… The right to be treated as an equal by all other men, she said, is man’s birthright. Never permit anyone to treat you otherwise. Who, indeed, is a better American, a better protector of the American heritage, than he who demands the fullest measure of respect for those cardinal principles on which our society is reared? Nana told us that there would be many and great obstacles in our paths and that this was the way of life. But only weaklings give up in the face of obstacles. Be honest and frank with yourself and the world at all times, she said. Never compromise what you know to be the right. Never pick a fight, but never run from one if your principles are at stake. Go out into the world with your head high, and keep it high at all times.»3 Step out into the world with your head high, fight for what is right, but show understanding and tolerance for others – what valuable advice for a young man to take with him when he leaves his childhood home! These words were deeply engraved in the mind of Ralph Bunche and fortified him for the challenges that lay ahead. As I have already mentioned, Bunche took up the study of racial and colonial problems early in his career. In a book published in 1936, under the title A World View of Race, he exposed all the unscientific nonsense promulgated about races, nonsense which has become a convenient and dangerous weapon in the hands of unscrupulous politicians and statesmen, as we know from Hitler’s Germany. He also analyzed French and British colonial policies which, however different they may be, have not allowed the natives an opportunity to develop their potential. He sees the racial problem as part and parcel of the much greater problem of the class war, the war between those who have and those who have not. This may rightly be called an oversimplification, and in later books he broadens his view of man and society, but we still find him returning time and time again to the opinion that the disparity between the standard of living in prosperous countries and that in underdeveloped countries is a source of unrest and a potential threat to peace. In an essay he wrote in 1947, Human Relations in a Modern World, he outlines the problems of our time. He contrasts man as a free individual with man as a member of a group. «In my opinion», he writes, «there is nothing in man’s nature which makes it impossible for him to live in peace with his fellowmen. Most of us, I believe, would be quite tractable if the pressures exerted by groups or by society would give us the chance. But relations between people are never governed by individuals, for the individual is to a great extent a product of the group to which he belongs and is subordinated to the group in all important questions. The individual in the mass is but a reflection of this group. And so the relations between groups and countries constitute one of the most critical problems of our time.» And he says: «We can achieve understanding and brotherhood between men only when the peoples of different nations feel that what unites them is a common goal which must be quickly attained.» Bunche himself has a strong faith in man: «I am firmly convinced that ordinary men everywhere are ready to accept the ideals inherent in understanding and brotherhood among men, if only they are given the chance. But before this can happen, men must be sure that they will not become victims of unstable economic conditions, they must not be forced to take part in ruthless and harmful competition in order to survive, and they must be free from the constant threat of being obliterated in a future war. But it is more important still that men be able to shape their ideals free from the influence of petty and narrow-minded men who still in many countries exploit these ideals to further their own ends… But an indolent, complacent, and uninformed people can never feel secure or free.» One can say: This is a faith, a belief. But who can do man’s work in life without faith? In Bunche this faith is coupled with a profound knowledge of men and of their conditions of life, both of which he clearly demonstrated as a mediator in Palestine. Until 1948 Bunche’s activities had been confined to scientific and administrative work. However, when on May 20, 1948, Folke Bernadotte4 was appointed by the United Nations as mediator in the Palestine conflict, Bunche became his closest collaborator. The two men worked together until Bernadotte’s assassination on September 17 of the same year. Bunche was then named as his successor by the UN and continued the work of mediation in Palestine until August of 1949. The two men who met in 1948 to undertake this common task could hardly have been more unlike. On the one hand, Folke Bernadotte, grandson of King Oscar II of Sweden and nephew of Sweden’s reigning monarch5, steeped in all the traditions of a royal family; on the other, Bunche, whose grandmother had been born in slavery, who had been brought up in poverty, who was an entirely self-made man. Folke Bernadotte was scantily informed on the Palestine conflict. «My knowledge of the situation in Palestine was very superficial», he confessed. He had not worked with international problems until the latter part of the war, when he succeeded in negotiating the release of Danish and Norwegian prisoners from German prison and concentration camps. Bunche, head of the Trusteeship Department of the United Nations, had back of him an education and training directed precisely at recognizing and understanding the problems raised by international disputes. Yet the two men had one thing in common: they both believed in their mission. Bunche at one time speaks of the qualities mediators should possess: «They should be biased against war and for peace. They should have a bias which would lead them to believe in the essential goodness of their fellowman and that no problem of human relations is insoluble. They should be biased against suspicion, intolerance, hate, religious and racial bigotry.»6 Both men were well endowed with such qualities, and indeed they had to be richly endowed to have hope of accomplishing the difficult task which confronted them in Palestine. The Palestine problem had occupied the United Nations for a long time. It would take too much time to go into the background of the dispute, whose origins date back to the end of the First World War. In 1948 matters had reached the stage of a proposal put forward in the United Nations for a solution embodying the creation of a Jewish state. But this suggestion met determined resistance, and the whole of 1948 had been a year of constant skirmishes, if not of open war. When the British mandate over Palestine came to an end on May 15, 1948, there was actually open war already between the Arab States and the Jews. The Truce Commission which was sent to Palestine in April was unable t o make any headway, and it was in these circumstances that the United Nations on May 20 appointed Bernadotte as a mediator whose first task was to secure a truce. Bernadotte and Bunche arrived in Palestine on May 28 and succeeded in obtaining a four-week truce, lasting from June 11 until July 9. This was a first step forward. But on July 11 hostilities broke out again, and on the sixteenth the Security Council ordered a cease-fire and an extension of the truce from July 18. This order came after Bernadotte had personally laid the case before the Security Council. It is noteworthy that this was the first time that the Security Council had given such an order. Then came Bernadotte’s assassination on September 17 and, as already mentioned, the Security Council appointed Bunche to succeed him as mediator. The initial cease-fire had been difficult to secure, and there can be no doubt that its swift arrangement was possible only through the personal efforts of Bernadotte and Bunche. The latter comments7: «This truce was a one-man feat. Count Bernadotte was a man of great urbanity and indefatigable energy. He was a true internationalist at heart and was devoted to the cause of peace. He was fearless. In a remarkably short period, he had won the respect and confidence of both Arabs and Jews.» The truce which began on July 18 was broken again in the middle of October. It was then that Bunche took the daring step of proposing to the Security Council that it should order a cease-fire to allow both parties to try to reach agreement on an armistice as a preliminary to a final settlement of the relations between Palestine and the Arab States. His proposal was approved by the Security Council on the sixteenth of November. The proposal was, as I have said, a daring one, for an armistice is more than a cease-fire; an armistice, in the accepted meaning of the word, is in effect a preliminary to peace. But it turned out that Bunche had judged the situation correctly. And so began the negotiations between the Arab States and Palestine, negotiations which dragged on for eleven months, making the greatest demands on the mediator. Bunche has himself described the difficulties in the Colgate Lectures in Human Relations, 1949: suspicion on both sides, with neither wanting to meet the other. The Arabs did not want to sit at the same table with the Jews; so he was compelled to negotiate separately with each side, constantly having to clear away the mutual mistrust. It must be borne in mind that this was not mediation between two parties but between Palestine on the one hand and seven Arab States on the other, and that agreements had to be concluded separately with each of the seven. By exercising infinite patience, Bunche finally succeeded in persuading all parties to accept an armistice. When asked how he managed it, he gave the following reply: «Like every Negro in America, I’ve been buffeted about a great deal. I’ve suffered many disillusioning experiences. Inevitably, I’ve become allergic to prejudice. On the other hand, from my earliest years I was taught the virtues of tolerance; militancy in fighting for rights – but not bitterness. And as a social scientist I’ve always cultivated a coolness of temper, an attitude of objectivity when dealing with human sensitivities and irrationalities, which has always proved invaluable – never more so than in the Palestine negotiations. Success there was dependent upon maintaining complete objectivity. Throughout the endless weeks of negotiations I was bolstered by an unfailing sense of optimism. Somehow, I knew we had to succeed. I am an incurable optimist, as a matter offact.»8 In these words he describes himself: the childhood heritage, the knowledge and experience acquired later in life – both factors going to make up the personality, the man who succeeded in getting both parties to lay down their arms. The outcome was a victory for the ideas of the United Nations, it is true, but as is nearly always the case, it was one individual’s efforts that made victory possible. It is just over a year since Ralph Bunche completed his work of mediation. Today we are all confronted by even greater challenges than before. The future looks dark. But it is precisely in times like these that we must not lose heart; on the contrary, we must put our faith and all our strength in the fight against war. Ralph Bunche, you have said yourself that you are an incurable optimist. You said that you were convinced that the mediation in Palestine would be successful. You have a long day’s work ahead of you. May you succeed in bringing victory to the ideals of peace, the foundation upon which we must build the future of mankind. 2. Bunche, «What America Means to Me», p. 123. 3. Ibid., p. 126. 4.

"29","1951","Léon Jouhaux"," Alfred Nobel’s Peace Prize is this year   awarded to Léon Jouhaux.    Léon Jouhaux can look back upon a long life of work and   struggle to elevate the working classes – and first of all to   improve their conditions. To fight through the trade unions to   raise the standard of living of the working class is an important   and noble thing to do. But many others have devoted themselves to   such work, and that alone would not have brought him here today   to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. He is here because from his   earliest years he has time after time thrown himself into the   fight for peace and against war, doing so in the International   Federation of Trade Unions, in the International Labor Office,   the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the European Movement.   Cooperation reaching across national frontiers and the removal of   social and economic inequalities both within nations and between   nations have for him been the most important means of combating   war. But he has had an even broader objective: to mold a social   environment capable of breeding what he calls the man of   tomorrow, the man who will be able to create a society in which   war is no longer possible.    Léon Jouhaux was born in 18781, the son of a factory worker. He went   to work himself at the age of thirteen, eventually becoming a   worker in the match factory like his father and soon entering the   French trade-union movement. In 1909 he became secretary of the   national organization [C.G.T.] 2   with which he has been associated throughout his life, remaining   loyal to it in bad times as well as in good.    In his book Le Syndicalisme français, which was   published in 1913 and which naturally bears the stamp of that   time, he describes the organization of the French trade-union   movement, its aims and methods. What is remarkable in a book   dealing mainly with collective action is his emphatic conclusion   that, in the final analysis, it is essential to awaken and to   educate the individual to prepare himself for the great and   arduous task of building the society of the future.    Jouhaux has been in the forefront of the French trade-union   movement in a difficult and troubled time. War and economic   depression have followed hard upon each other, and the   trade-union movement has been split asunder, reunified, and split   again. Faithful to his principles, Jouhaux has always done his   utmost to prevent disunity, but if a schism could not be avoided,   he has given his allegiance to the non-Communist section of the   trade unions. He has always firmly believed that a trade union   should have room for everyone and that it should build on the   solidarity of the working class as such, remaining outside   political parties. Consequently, he himself has never been an   active politician except in the conflict with antidemocratic   forces such as fascism in the period between the two wars and   communism after the last war. He served the Popular Front in   France between the wars and in recent years has taken part in the   fight against communism.    We cannot evaluate Jouhaux’s contribution without knowing   something of his activity in the French trade-union movement, it   is true, but today we are concerned primarily with his intensive   work for international cooperation and peace.    Even in his youth – before the earliest signs of the First World   War – he was involved in trying to reduce national antagonisms   and in fighting against war. The most significant example of this   activity was the plan for a meeting in Berlin in 1911 between   representatives of French, German, and British trade unions to   formulate a protest against war. The background of this meeting   was the tense situation between France and Germany resulting from   their conflicting interests in Morocco. France had occupied the   capital of Morocco, and in July Kaiser Wilhelm3 had sent a warship to Agadir to protect   German interests. In both countries this released a wave of   nationalism that could easily have led to war.    The meeting in Berlin did not achieve the importance expected. At   Germany’s suggestion, only a few delegates from the C.G.T. went   to Berlin, ostensibly to study the German trade-union movement,   but this so-called study culminated in a large public   demonstration against war. Later the same year another meeting   was held in Paris, attended by representatives from Germany,   Spain, and Great Britain.    Jouhaux speaks of both these meetings in his book Le   Syndicalisme français in the chapter entitled   «Contre le guerre». This chapter is a fiery appeal to   the workers to oppose war, an appeal which lays great stress on   the fact that private capitalism and competition in heavy   industry between different countries constitute the main reason   for war. It is not at all surprising that Jouhaux saw the   situation in this light, for at that time France was building up   her colonial empire, and Germany’s industry was expanding apace.   His attack was therefore directed as much against his own   country’s colonial policy as against Germany, and he fearlessly   opposed the wave of nationalism which was sweeping through both   countries. And even though we have now learned that the danger of   war is not lessened by individual states’ having control over   private capital, his appeal will still stand as one of the major   attempts made prior to World War I to mobilize the forces of   labor against war. It is also the first serious attempt to   establish contact between French and German workers. He   emphasizes the importance of this, for, he says, in this way a   start could be made to erase the bitterness and hatred which had   plagued relations between the peoples of France and Germany for   the past forty years. «We are thus creating between the   French and German people the “entente cordiale” so desirable for   the peace of the world».    There were many people at that time – Jouhaux among them – who   believed that through mass action the workers would be able to   prevent war. But no appeal – including the last, which was sent   by the C.G.T. in July of 1914 – was to succeed. As we all know,   war broke out in 1914, and Jouhaux took an active part in it, for   this war was in defense of all that he himself had worked for   throughout his life: democracy and freedom. He declared that a   German victory would mean the destruction of democracy and   freedom in Europe.    Yet all wars end, and everyone who looks ahead must try to find   the way to a lasting peace. This Jouhaux sought to do. Already in   the autumn of 1914, the C.G.T. traced the outlines of a peace   program which was in essence the same as that proposed by the   American Federation of Labor, and its general theme was seen   again in President Wilson‘s   Fourteen Points.    Once the war was over, Jouhaux resumed his position in the C.G.T.   Thereafter, however, he was to work in a larger area.    In 1919 he was appointed a member of the committee on labor   questions at the Paris Peace Conference, and so had the   opportunity of taking part in the founding of the International Labor Organization. In the   same year he was elected a member of its Governing Body, a   position which he still holds. In 1919 he was also elected   vice-president of the International Federation of Trade Unions in   Amsterdam.    Let us first of all consider Léon Jouhaux’s contribution as   a member of the International Labor Office. This organization is   the only major international institution linked with the League   of Nations which has survived the war. It is also the   organization with the widest field of activity. Its objective is   to remove one of the great obstacles to the realization of a   lasting peace; in the words of its Constitution:    Whereas, The League of Nations has for its object the   establishment of universal peace, and such a peace can be   established only if it is based upon social justice;      And whereas, Conditions of labor exist   involving such injustice, hardship, and privation to large   numbers of people as to produce unrest so great that the peace   and harmony of the world are imperiled…      Whereas also, The failure of any nation to   adopt humane conditions of labor is an obstacle in the way of   other nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own   countries;      The High Contracting Parties, moved by   sentiments of justice and humanity as well as by the desire to   secure the permanent peace of the world, agree to the   following…    Then follow the articles which define the organization and   function of the Labor Organization. This new institution differed   in one particularly significant respect from the League of   Nations: only governments were represented in the latter, whereas   the ILO gathered under its roof the representatives of trade   unions and employers’ organizations, as well as those of   governments. Its operation is therefore based on the   collaboration of two parties apt to hold divergent views on many   issues affecting labor. These two parties come together to confer   at an international forum, and nothing is so conducive to   understanding and goodwill as personal meeting and discussion of   problems. The work of the ILO during the thirty-two years of its   existence has been of very great importance in promoting social   justice and in creating equal working conditions in different   countries. The organization has been quick to lend an ear to new   problems as they occurred, and it has not been timid in tackling   them.    The work which has been done is impressive, and we can rightly   claim that it is work in the service of peace.    Throughout all these thirty-two years, Léon Jouhaux has been   on the Governing Body of the ILO, and there is no other living   member whose contribution can compare with his.    As a workers’ representative at the International Labor Office,   Jouhaux was a member of the League of Nations committee entrusted   with the study of disarmament problems. He has described this   work in his very interesting book Désarmemert which,   although published in 1927, is well worth reading even today. In   this book Jouhaux expresses his faith in the League of Nations as   an international body capable of giving individual nations a   sense of security. For no nation will feel safe, he says, as long   as its neighbor is militarily strong, and under such   circumstances it will not itself desire disarmament. But if   security is guaranteed by an international body, then the road to   disarmament is open. These are the same ideas current today, and   if Jouhaux was not the first to voice them, he has championed   them more energetically than most people. He demands that the   armament industry should not be privately owned and that if it   is, it must be brought under the control of the state. He calls   for the control of international trade in armaments and for   effective control by the League of Nations over disarmament. I   believe scarcely anyone today would deny that the manufacture of   armaments ought not to be a source of economic profit, or that   the international arms trade should be subject to control. But   even if this can be brought about – and it has been accomplished   in a number of countries – we now realize that state ownership of   the armament industry and control of the sale of arms do not in   themselves offer a guarantee of peace. Be that as it may, we must   judge his ideas in the context of the times in which they were   conceived, a period when the vast private empires that ruled the   armament industry were at the peak of their power and when the   trade in arms was unrestricted. Today these factors are no longer   the main obstacles to disarmament. On the other hand, the   proposal made by Jouhaux for an effective organ to supervise   disarmament is just as valid today as it was then and as such is   well worth considering afresh.    As we all know, the League of Nations failed in its attempts to   secure disarmament. But the man whose goal is to build for the   future does not give up the struggle when he suffers a setback.   Neither did Jouhaux.    His work during these years was not confined to the Labor Office   and the League of Nations. He took part in every kind of work for   peace. He fought for the removal of those articles in the Treaty   of Versailles which to him and to many others appeared to stand   in the way of international cooperation and understanding. He   supported the policy of reconciliation pursued by Briand and Stresemann.    The period between the wars was a changing one: from the buoyant   optimism of the twenties it passed to the steadily growing   pessimism of the thirties. The economy of the world collapsed,   crisis followed crisis, and high unemployment plagued every   nation. It is not strange then that a man like Jouhaux should in   times like these call again and again for steps to prevent the   recurrence of crises which provide, as he says, a fertile soil   for autarchy and consequently for war.    When Hitler4 rose to power in   Germany, the more farsighted saw the danger of war becoming   greater and greater from one year to the next. Jouhaux was one of   those who interpreted the situation correctly and, unlike so many   of his colleagues, strove hard for the strengthening of French   defences. After Hitler’s move in Czechoslovakia in 1938, Jouhaux   tried to solidify the international democratic front. In that   same year he met Roosevelt   and asked him to intervene against Germany, but without   success.    And then the war broke out. Jouhaux once again worked from the   very first days of the war to bring the labor movement to exert   its influence to make the eventual peace a true one. He himself   stayed in France during the war until the end of 1942 when he was   arrested by the Germans. He remained in German captivity until   the war ended.    During the years that followed, Jouhaux experienced many   disappointments, first when the non-Communist trade-union leaders   in France left the C.G.T. in 1947 to set up their own   organization, and again when the new World Federation of Trade   Unions was split in 1949. In both events he saw a breach in the   solidarity of the working class, that solidarity outside   political parties for which he had always toiled so earnestly. He   himself joined with the non-Communist trade unionists.    In his own country Jouhaux has since 1947 been president of the   Conseil économique, an advisory body concerned with all   important economic questions, one which he had first proposed   forty years earlier and which was finally legally established   under the new French Constitution5 of 1946.    On the international front, he has continued his activity in the   ILO, he has been a French delegate at the United Nations   Assembly, and he has taken part in the European Movement, of   which he became president in 1949.    This brief sketch of his life’s work gives but the merest   impression of Jouhaux’s contribution and of its influence on   world affairs. These cannot be measured by a list of his   activities or of his individual achievements. A lifework is given   true substance and value only by the vital individual who puts   his life into the struggle.    It is this kind of person that we find in Léon Jouhaux. His   whole life reveals a man who has never faltered in the fight to   attain the goal which he set himself in his youth: to lay the   foundations of a world which could belong to all men alike, a   world where peace would prevail. He has realized that such a   world can never become a reality unless its society is based on   social justice and democracy.    He knew that the first step toward this ideal was to uplift the   working class and to improve its conditions, but he has also   understood that this is only a means of laying the foundation for   a new world.    From all this emerges the man, the warm, impulsive, and inspiring   human being who has been able to draw others along with him but   who has also shown that in order to reach our ultimate goal we   must build on the world of reality in which we live.    He has devoted his life to the work of promoting brotherhood   among men and nations, and to the fight against war.    1. Most sources agree upon 1879 as   the correct date.    2.

"30","1952","Albert Schweitzer"," Albert Schweitzer was born in Alsace in   1875, a few years after this province had become part of the   German Empire. He has seen Alsace reincorporated with France,   overrun by the Germans during the Second World War, and then once   again reunited with France. Having grown up in this border   country, Schweitzer has from an early age known three languages:   the dialect of Alsace, High German, and French. His upbringing   has also given him a deep insight into both French and German   cultures.    But Albert Schweitzer will never belong to any one nation. His   whole life and all of his work are a message addressed to all men   regardless of nationality or race. This is not to say that   Schweitzer does not, like most of us, bear the stamp of the home   and the country of his childhood and youth.    The son of a pastor, Albert Schweitzer grew up in the presbytery   of the little village of Günsbach in a happy and harmonious   home. He attended the village school along with the sons of the   peasants. These childhood years, which he has himself described,   saw the development within the boy of those attributes which were   later to characterize the man. He speaks of little incidents   which suddenly opened his eyes to traits which had previously   lain dormant within him. He tells us, for example, of how an old   Jew who occasionally passed through the village became a target   for ridicule from the boys and of how he responded to their   goading with only a gentle smile. That smile overpowered Albert   Schweitzer, who subsequently took care to greet the old man with   respect. Elsewhere he says that one day he threw one of his   schoolmates at wrestling and that afterwards the boy said to him,   «If I could eat broth every day the way you do, I could be   strong too». Those words made a deep impression on the young   Albert; from that moment he not only lost his taste for broth but   also began to insist upon dressing like the peasant boys. A final   instance: a boy once persuaded him to go bird hunting, but   Schweitzer scared off the birds before the other had a chance to   shoot.    We all no doubt have such experiences during childhood, but we   often forget them in later years or merely smile when we recall   them in the «wisdom of maturity». But to Albert   Schweitzer they became something more. The feelings evoked by   these incidents, far from fading, persisted in him and became the   very basis of his later life despite all the experience and   knowledge which he subsequently acquired.    After finishing at the village school, he continued his education   in Münster and later in Mülhausen where he lived with   his uncle and aunt. He admits that he was not a particularly   promising pupil. «I was probably too much of a   dreamer», he says. Only the teachers with whom he   established a personal contact were able to record above-average   performance. History and natural science were his favorite   subjects. It was during those formative years between childhood   and adolescence that he opened his eyes to the world about him   and began to ask Why? He says himself: «Between the ages of   fourteen and sixteen I had a compelling desire to discuss   everything. The joy of seeking the truth and the purpose of   things became almost an obsession with me»1 Some may say that it was the scientist   in him that had awakened. Or was the urge to solve the enigma of   existence perhaps already asserting itself subconsciously? During   this period he also found time to cultivate and develop the great   talent for music which he had shown since childhood, and to make   a start on his masterly work on Johann Sebastian Bach.    The qualities dimly discernible in Albert Schweitzer as a boy   stood out more clearly in early youth, qualities which were to   distinguish his entire life and work: deep compassion for every   living thing, and the belief that people who live happy lives owe   much to those less fortunate and thus have an obligation to help   them. «As far back as I can remember», he says,   «the thought of all the misery in the world has been a   source of pain to me.»2    Without doubt, the young man’s feeling of oneness with unhappy   and destitute fellow beings, as well as his compulsion to inquire   into the meaning and purpose of existence, was largely the result   of innate qualities of his own. But it is no less certain that   the environment in which the boy was brought up helped to   strengthen them. His home, his father’s sermons, the tolerance he   found in the Günsbach church, where both Catholic and   Protestant services were held under the same roof, must all have   influenced the sensitive, religious mind of the young boy. And   the family traditions, reaching back to the time of the   Enlightenment – his maternal grandfather was a well – known   rationalist pastor-also left their mark. This view seems to   coincide with Schweitzer’s own, for, after telling us of his   insatiable curiosity, he concludes: «The spirit of the   Enlightenment, inherited from my grandfather Schillinger, was   rekindled in me.»3    I have dwelt so long on Albert Schweitzer’s youth because I   believe that it explains all of his later life and work. Already   at that time a flame burned within him, a flame which he has kept   alight throughout his entire life and which has become the   inspirational source for all his activity. Here is what he   himself has to say: «The conviction that we must, throughout   life, struggle to continue to think and to feel as we did in our   youth has accompanied me as a faithful adviser. I have   instinctively taken care not to become what most of us understand   by the term “a man of experience”. The knowledge of life which we   adults should pass on to the younger generation is: “Grow into   your ideals so that life cannot rob you of them.” »4    His schooldays over, Albert Schweitzer entered upon his academic   career, with its years of study and hard work. The curiosity   which he had revealed so early in life had by this time swelled   into an insatiable desire to seek an answer to all the questions   that crowded in upon him. And if we are to know Albert   Schweitzer, we must understand the profound respect and reverence   in which he held truth acquired through thought and reason. He   had shown this respect at an early age, and we have his own word   for it that it has in no way faded over the years: «If I   were to renounce any of the enthusiasm I feel for seeking truth,   I should be renouncing myself.»5    His years of study were rich in work and achievement. In addition   to pursuing his theological and philosophical studies, he began   his work on the life of Christ and on the Gospels, and started   rough outlines for his works on philosophy, culture, and ethics.   At the same time, he was playing Bach, was engrossing himself in   Bach’s works, and was becoming the foremost authority of his time   on the composer as well as the outstanding interpreter of his   music. In spite of all this activity he found time to take an   interest in the construction of organs, and it is largely thanks   to him that so many old organs have been saved from so-called   modernization6.    But all this time, preoccupied as he was by creative work, he   heard a voice within him which gave him no peace: Did he who had   enjoyed such a happy childhood and youth have the right to accept   all this happiness as a matter of course? The natural right to   happiness, and all the suffering prevailing in the world merged   into one in his mind and gave decisive direction to his future   life and work. It became steadily clearer to him that anyone who   enjoys many of the good things of life should in his turn repay   to others no less than he has received, and that we should all   share the burden of life’s suffering. These thoughts did not   always return with the same intensity, but gathered slowly and   inexorably. At last «they covered the whole sky», as he   puts it, and led him at the age of twenty-one to the decision to   devote himself to the ministry, to scholarship, and to music   until he was thirty and then, after having realized his   aspirations in the fields of art and learning, to help his   fellowmen in a more direct manner.    We gather from what Albert Schweitzer has written about this   period of his life that he had not yet formulated any precise   plans. But one day in 1904, when he was twenty-nine years old, he   read an appeal from the French Protestant Missionary Society in   Paris asking for help for the Negroes in French Equatorial   Africa. This appeal provided him with a direct answer to his   question: «How can I help best?» He wanted to   contribute his share to the payment of the debt which the white   man owed the black, and he resolved to prepare himself for this   task. To do so he had to become a doctor.    We must try to grasp the full implications of this decision: to   be thirty years old, to be a well-known scholar in both theology   and philosophy, to have written a book on Bach and to have become   a world-renowned interpreter of Bach’s music, and then-to cut all   this short! He himself explains why he wanted to go through the   arduous toil of medical study first before setting to work:   «I wanted to become a doctor in order to be able to work   without words. For years I had used the word. My new occupation   would be not to talk about the gospel of love, but to put it into   practice.»7    The study of medicine claimed seven years of Schweitzer’s life,   from 1905 to 1913. Of it he says:    «The pursuit of natural sciences gave me more than just the   knowledge I sought. It was for me a spiritual experience. I had   always felt that the so called humanities with which I had been   concerned present a psychic danger because they rarely reveal   self-evident truths, but often present value judgments which   masquerade as truth because of the way in which they are   clothed…    Now, suddenly, I stood in another world. I was now working with   truths based on realities, and I was among men who took it for   granted that every statement had to be supported by   fact.»8    The study of medicine gave him great satisfaction; indeed it was   as if he had been initiated into an entirely new world.   Nevertheless, while pursuing his intensive medical studies (and   paying for them by lecturing and giving organ recitals), he   continued his work in philosophy and theology and during this   period completed the German edition of his work on Bach, as well   as his study on Bach’s preludes and fugues.    In 1913 Schweitzer finished his studies and qualified as a doctor   of medicine. To obtain the money he needed to purchase equipment   for his projected hospital in Africa, he pleaded with his friends   and acquaintances to the point of begging. Meanwhile, the   Protestant Missionary Society had expressed doubts as to his   «orthodoxy», and it was only after Schweitzer had given   a formal promise to confine himself to his medical work and not   try to influence the faith of the Christian Negroes that the   Society accepted him.    And so at long last, on Good Friday in the spring of 1913, Albert   Schweitzer set out upon his journey to Lambaréné in   West Africa. Lambaréné is a small village on the banks   of the River Ogowé close to the equator, some 125 miles from   the coast. It was here that Schweitzer began his new life, a life   totally different from that of the academic world in which he had   moved hitherto and one which demanded very different qualities.   There, deep in the primeval forest, he began his work among   backward natives who had met the white man and who had become   acquainted with what European civilization brings in its wake   whenever it breaks new ground: alcohol, disease, disintegration   of the existing social systems; in short, all the evils which the   white man first brings with him. It soon became evident that   Schweitzer not only possessed great organizing ability, but also   was adept in practical skills such as the building of the houses   – or perhaps we should say huts – which were needed for the   treatment and care of the sick.    More important still, Schweitzer understood the mentality of   these primitive people. He did not appraise them with the eyes of   a European and made no attempt to judge them according to our   social customs and moral codes. For instance, he recognized   polygamy as a natural consequence of their society and he   believed that he would only make the bad worse by trying to   abolish it. Nor did he adhere to the view that emphasized the   educating of the Negroes in order to produce officials and   scholars. He had no desire to destroy their existing social   organizations and conventions unless he could replace them with   something better. He understood that help had to be given in such   a way that it could take effect gradually and without any sudden   disruption of existing social systems. He realized that the task   ahead would be a long and difficult one and that, if he was to   make any headway at all, he would have to use simple methods   which the natives could understand.    And so he helps them, heals them, and tries with untiring   patience, day after day, year after year, to release them   gradually from the powerful and pernicious grasp of superstition;   all this in the hope that he will in the end perhaps succeed,   after innumerable and bitter disappointments, in sowing a seed   which may bring to life faith in the gospel of love. If we choose   to judge his achievement in terms of success in fighting sickness   and disease, then we should of course give pride of place to his   work as a doctor. But let us never lose sight of the fact that   the very impact of his personality and the propagation of his   gospel of love will in the final instance achieve more, and will,   in addition, stimulate the growth of brotherhood among races. If   we read Schweitzer’s own accounts of his life in Africa, the   impression we get is not at all one of a sermonizing missionary,   but of a realistic man well-acquainted with every aspect of life   in the jungle, and of one whose work is dictated by the need to   help and to do so where the suffering is greatest.    Albert Schweitzer’s initial stay in Africa was, however,   short-lived. When the First World War broke out in 1914, he was   placed under surveillance as a German citizen, and in 1917 he and   his wife were brought back to an internment camp in France. The   leisure he enjoyed there enabled him to continue with his   religious, philosophical, and cultural studies which he had in   any case never entirely laid aside, even in Africa where he   devoted part of his nights to them.    When Schweitzer was released from internment in 1918, he was ill,   and he stayed on in Europe until 1924. Since that date he has   been living in Africa, leaving only to take an occasional trip to   Europe; and during the years between 1939 and 1948 he never left   at all. Indeed, he is there now.    His visits to Europe have always been marked by intense activity.   It seems that he has no need of rest. He has given recitals, both   to offer pleasure to others and to obtain funds for the hospital   at Lambaréné, which he has steadily enlarged. He has   given talks on religious and cultural topics, all the while still   searching for a simple definition of his philosophy, some   expression of it able to give others a meaning and direction to   their lives. We should never forget that Schweitzer is a man with   the deepest respect for thought, and that it is through thought   that he seeks to answer the questions he asks himself «If we   renounce thought, we become spiritually bankrupt,» he says,   «for anyone who loses faith in man’s ability to discover   truth through thought drifts into skepticism.»9    Schweitzer’s faith in the power of reason and his craving for   truth are unshaken and unaltered. But he has come to the   conclusion that systematic, logical thought can take us to a   certain point, and no further. He says: «The only progress   that knowledge allows is in enabling us to describe more and more   in detail the world we see and its evolution. What matters in a   world-view is to grasp the meaning and purpose of everything, and   that we cannot do.»10 He   believes that he is the first Western thinker who has dared to   admit this shattering conclusion without at the same time   renouncing a philosophy and a world-view that enshrine   life.    But it was many years before he was enable to crystallize this   philosophy into the simple formula: Reverence for life. One day   in 1915 – he was forty years old at the time – while traveling on   a river in Africa, he saw the rays of the sun shimmering on the   water, the tropical forest all around, and a herd of   hippopotamuses basking on the banks of the river. At that moment   there came to him, as if by revelation, the phrase which   precisely expressed his thought: Reverence for life11. Once again, as before in youth and   childhood, a simple incident opened the door for him.    «But», he says, «one cannot come to this by   systematic logical reasoning and knowledge, for neither can   furnish an explanation of the world and of the purpose of   life». The explanation is found through what he calls   elemental thought. This leads to a reverence for that ineffable   thing which is life, to an affirmation of life which is more than   the will to live. Schweitzer puts it this way: «I am life   that wills to live in the midst of other life that wills to   live.»12 There is an   affirmation of life in this which leads one beyond self to a   reverence for all will to live, so that everything which   maintains, nourishes, and ennobles life is good and positive, and   all else is evil and negative. On this thought Schweitzer builds   his universal ethic, and through it he believes mankind comes   into spiritual communion with the eternal. He calls this   philosophy of life «ethical mysticism».    Albert Schweitzer has been called an agnostic. If an agnostic is   understood to be a man who admits that we cannot find the answer   to essential questions through rational thinking, then the term   can justifiably be applied to him. But he takes his reasoning a   step further and states that if rational thinking is carried far   enough it leads to irrational mysticism.    I would prefer to put it like this: Where thought reaches its   limits, there faith begins, and we are then close to religion.   Schweitzer himself has expressed it in these words: «The   world-view based on reverence for life is, through the religious   character of its ethic of active love and through its fervor,   essentially akin to that of Christianity… What Christianity   needs is to be filled with the spirit of Jesus Christ, to become   living, intense, a religion of love which it was meant to be.   Since I myself am deeply devoted to Christianity, I seek to serve   it with fidelity and truth. I hope that the thought which has   resulted in this simple, ethical-religious idea – reverence for   life – may help to bring Christianity and thought closer to each   other.»13    This then is what Albert Schweitzer has to say to us about   reverence for life, about the religion of love, and about the   concept of brotherhood. Great is the number of those who have in   the course of time talked to mankind about this, a greater number   in the past than in the present when the concept of brotherhood   is being eclipsed by so many of today’s slogans.    But even in these troubled and uncertain times men are searching   for something which will allow them to believe that mankind will   one day enjoy the reign of peace and goodwill.    If altruism, reverence for life, and the idea of brotherhood can   become living realities in the hearts of men, we will have laid   the very foundations of a lasting peace between individuals,   nations, and races.    We all realize that we are still far away from this goal. It is   the youth of today who will follow the path indicated by Albert   Schweitzer. All through his long life he has been true to his own   youth and he has shown us that a man’s life and his dream can   become one. His work has made the concept of brotherhood a living   one, and his words have reached and taken root in the minds of   countless men.    2. Ibid., pp. 60-61.    3. Ibid., p. 55.    4.

"31","1953","George C. Marshall"," When Cadet First Captain George Catlett   Marshall graduated from the Virginia Military Institute, the Nobel   Committee of the Norwegian Parliament was meeting to discuss   the awarding of Nobel’s Peace Prize for the first time. And on   the day when Marshall, who had not yet completed his twenty-first   year, received a letter from the Adjutant General of the Army   informing him that the examining board had found him eminently   suitable for appointment to the Regular Army and that his   commission would be issued to him after his twenty-first birthday   – on that very day1 the first   Peace Prize was awarded in Oslo. It was given to Henri Dunant, who had   founded the Red   Cross, and to Frédéric Passy,   who had organized the first French peace society and was a   pioneer in the work for international arbitration   agreements.    If anybody at that time had told Lieutenant George Marshall that   fifty years later he would not only be president of the American Red   Cross, but also that he himself would some day receive the   Peace Prize – the prediction would hardly have been believed and   still less welcomed. Young George Marshall may have seen himself   as a future general; but he had a long way to travel before he   arrived at the clear and passionate understanding that the final   object to be obtained by war, the only justifiable goal, is to   make another war impossible. It was a way that would take him   over larger areas of the earth and the oceans and under the skies   than any commander has traveled before him, and let him see more   battlefields and a greater devastation than any general has seen   before him, and let him plan and direct larger armies and fleets   and air forces than history has ever known.    Two things stand out for those trying to follow Marshall’s   development. On the one hand the insatiable desire to learn, to   know, to understand, and on the other hand his keen and   wide-awake interest in the individual soldier, his indefatigable   work for the welfare of the soldier. Both things have had a   far-reaching influence on his work and on the spiritual and   social evolution of his mind.    His eagerness to find out everything about the human beings for   whom he felt responsible made him a sometimes rather terrifying   phenomenon among his contemporaries. Twenty-one years old, he was   made commanding officer of some of the small and utterly lonely   outposts in the Philippines; he studied the language and customs   and mentality of the natives; he realized that the discipline he   valued so highly depended first of all on his own self-discipline   and his capacity for keeping his men intelligently occupied, for   giving them tasks which could awaken their interest. Two words   above all others became his guide – as he underlined it years   later in an address to the graduating class at his old military   school – the words honor and self-sacrifice.    The young officer demanded much from his men, but still more from   himself. When he graduated from V.M. I. after four years, there   was not a single demerit beside his name. And so it has continued   throughout his life. His record has always been perfectly clean   and bright. He was as straight and erect morally as he was   physically. Wherever he was sent by his superiors he won the same   reputation for eminent ability. Typical of the high esteem in   which he was held is what happened in 1916 when he returned to   the States from his second long stay in the Philippines. He took   over the training program of a camp in Utah; and when the camp   closed, the commanding officer was required to make an efficiency   report on the officers under his command. One standard question   is: «Would you desire to have him under your immediate   command in peace and in war?»    The Colonel2 wrote in reply   concerning Marshall: «Yes, but I would prefer to serve   under his command… In my judgment there are not five   officers in the Army so well qualified as he to command a   division in the field.»    The Colonel then recommended that he be promoted to brigadier   general, notwithstanding regulations, and then added to   underscore his statement: «He is my junior by over 1,800   files.»    With this reputation and such military recommendations, Marshall   sailed for France in June, 1917, with the first ship in the first   convoy of American troops. The incredible want of preparedness,   the confusion, the chaos, the lack of arms and munitions which   resulted in 25,000 casualties in this first division of 27,000   were destined to be Marshall’s nightmare for many years to come.   It was made his task to organize both this division and others;   he became chief of operations of the division and later the aide   to General Pershing. In the American official military   records it is stated laconically: «He was assigned to   general headquarters at Chaumont and given the task of drafting   the plans for the St. Mihiel offensive… As that battle got   under way, he was given the task of transferring some 500,000   troops and 2,700 guns to the Argonne front in preparation for   that battle.»3 He was made a   temporary major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel; he was   recommended for promotion to brigadier general by General   Pershing whose right-hand man he had become. Pershing’s   recommendation, however, was not accepted by higher authority,   and after the Armistice Marshall became captain once more; for   under American law promotion in times of peace can only be given   under the strictest rules of seniority. And Marshall had to wait   for fifteen years before he was made a colonel again.    It is not hard to understand why, once made chief of staff, he   demanded that the rules of promotion be amended. The amendment   was passed in September, 1940, and before the end of the year a   certain Major Eisenhower was made colonel and then brigadier   general, jumping 366 senior colonels.    During the years between the wars, Marshall was stationed in   Tientsin for three years. And just as in the Philippines he had   become an authority on the history and ethnography of the   islands, so in Tientsin he studied Chinese civilization, history,   and language. He was the only American officer who could examine   Chinese witnesses that appeared before him without the aid of   interpreters. And his few spare hours he utilized to learn to   write Chinese.    During the years of depression when he was colonel once again,   the soldiers’ pay was reduced to such an extent that the married   men suffered real hardship, and their regimental commander   started his first Marshall aid. He taught his troops to raise   chickens and hogs; he showed them how to start vegetable gardens.   He instituted a lunch-pail system by which, on the payment of   fifteen cents, each member of the family was fed; the price was   the same, however many members there were in the family. He and   Mrs. Marshall ate the same dinner so that it should not smack of   condescending charity. Marshall had under his command an ever   increasing number of C.C.C. camps4, that curious attempt to combine some   kind of military training with the effort to fight unemployment.   For the undernourished, anemic, helpless young men of these camps   he had an absorbing interest. He organized schools for them, had   them start news-sheets, amateur theatricals; he had their teeth   taken care of; he stopped all drunkenness among them. And when   Marshall in 1938 became assistant chief of staff and then deputy   chief and in 1939 was appointed chief of staff, he took with him   to Washington this active sympathy for the private soldier, this   strong feeling that the soldier has needs other than the merely   physical. The United States at that time had an active army of   approximately 174,000 enlisted men scattered over 130 posts,   camps, and stations. In Marshall’s first biennial report5 on the state of the armed forces he   remarks:    «As an army we were ineffective. Our equipment, modern at   the conclusion of the World War, was now, in a large measure,   obsolescent. In fact, during the postwar period, continuous   paring of appropriations had reduced the Army virtually to the   status of that of a third-rate power.»    The United States had no military strength that could prevent war   or even an attack on America. And Marshall, who saw the total war   approaching and his own country powerless, clearly realized the   truth of Alfred Nobel’s words: «Good intentions alone can   never secure peace.»    It was during these years before America was attacked that the   ground had to be laid for the later overwhelming war effort. It   was during these years that Mrs. Marshall, who was closest to   him, prayed every night: «O, Lord, grant him   time.»    The task before Marshall, the burdens he had to shoulder during   these years of war, seemed beyond the power of man to bear. That   he did not break down was probably due to what Senator   Russell6 expressed in the words:   «Most men are slaves of their ambition. General Marshall is   the slave of his duties.»    This deep-rooted, one might say fanatic, sense of duty imposed   upon him an iron self-discipline which came close to having the   character of a mystic faith. He made it articulate in the most   spontaneous and open speech he had ever made. In June, 1941, he   gave an address at Trinity College, an Episcopalian institution in   Hartford, Connecticut. He himself belongs to the Episcopalian   faith and is an active churchgoer. He said in his opening   remarks: «I know that being with you here today is good for   my soul.» Then he added: «If I were back in my office,   I would not be using the word soul.» He goes on to   define what he means by discipline; his doing so makes this   address important for the understanding of the man and his   work.    «We are replacing force of habit of body with force of habit   of mind. We are basing the discipline of the individual on   respect rather than on fear… It is morale that wins the   victory. It is not enough to fight. It is the spirit which we   bring to the fight that decides the issue.    The soldier’s heart, the soldier’s spirit, the soldier’s soul,   are everything. Unless the soldier’s soul sustains him he cannot   be relied on and will fail himself and his commander and his   country in the end… It is morale that wins the victory… The   French never found an adequate “dictionary” definition for the   word…    It is more than a word – more than any one word, or several   words, can measure.    Morale is a state of mind. It is steadfastness and courage and   hope. It is confidence and zeal and loyalty. It is   élan, esprit de corps and determination.    It is staying power, the spirit which endures to the end – the   will to win.    With it all things are possible, without it everything else,   planning, preparation, production, count for naught.    I have just said it is the spirit which endures to the end. And   so it is.»7    This remarkable address is at the same time a creed and a   program. It is the only speech in which Marshall directly and   openly expressed the ideas which occupied him most – outside his   daily work.    «We are building that morale – not on supreme confidence in   our ability to conquer and subdue other peoples; not in reliance   on things of steel and the super-excellence of guns and planes   and bombsights.    We are building it on things infinitely more potent. We are   building it on belief, for it is what men believe   that makes them invincible. We have sought for something more   than enthusiasm, something finer and higher than optimism or   self-confidence, something not merely of the intellect or the   emotions but rather something in the spirit of the man, something   encompassed only by the soul.    This army of ours already possesses a morale based on what we   allude to as the noblest aspirations of mankind – on the   spiritual forces which rule the world and will continue to do   so.    Let me call it the morale of omnipotence. With your endorsement   and support this omnipotent morale will be sustained as long as   the things of the spirit are stronger than the things of   earth.»8    But after the Trinity address Marshall retired behind his   protective armor. And the passion always smoldering in his mind   was not expressed in words until 1945 when he wrote his biennial   report on the course of the war; in this his words of sympathy   for the common soldier have an almost explosive quality:    «It is impossible for the Nation to compensate for the   services of a fighting man. There is no pay scale that is high   enough to buy the services of a single soldier during even a few   minutes of the agony of combat, the physical miseries of the   campaign, or of the extreme personal inconvenience of leaving his   home to go out to the most unpleasant and dangerous spots on   earth to serve his Nation.»9    Nobel’s Peace Prize is not given to Marshall for what he   accomplished during the war. Nevertheless, what he has done,   after the war, for peace is a corollary to this achievement, and   it is this great work for the establishment of peace which the   Nobel Committee has wanted to honor.    But two documents give some idea of General Marshall’s importance   to the democratic world during the years of war.    When the victory was won on May 8, 1945, Marshall was summoned to   the office of the secretary of war, the venerable Republican   Henry Stimson, one time law partner of Elihu Root, who was awarded the Nobel   Peace Prize for 191210. Mr.   Stimson had invited fourteen generals and high officials to be   present. The seventy-eight-year-old statesman then turned to   Marshall and said:    «I want to acknowledge my great personal debt to you, Sir,   in common with the whole country. No one who is thinking of   himself can rise to true heights. You have never thought of   yourself… I have never seen a task of such magnitude performed   by man.    It is rare in late life to make new friends; at my age it is a   slow process, but there is no one for whom I have such deep   respect and, I think, greater affection.    I have seen a great many soldiers in my lifetime and you, Sir,   are the finest soldier I have ever known.    It is fortunate for this country that we have you in this   position!»11    And when Marshall at his own request resigned as chief of staff   in November, 1945, he received from his British colleagues in the   combined chiefs of staff a message which is surely without   parallel. It was signed by Chief of the Imperial General Staff   Sir Alan Brooke (now Lord Alanbrooke), by Admiral of the Fleet   Lord Cunningham of Hyndhope, and by Marshal of the Royal Air   Force Lord Portal of Hungerford12. It reads: « On your retirement   after six years as Chief of Staff of the United States Army, we,   your British colleagues in the Combined Chiefs of Staff, send you   this message of farewell.    We regret that Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Admiral of the   Fleet Sir Dudley Pound, two of your greatest friends and   admirers, are not alive today to add their names to ours. As   architect and builder of the finest and most powerful Army in   American History, your name will be honoured among those of the   greatest soldiers of your own or any other country.    Throughout your association with us in the higher direction of   the armed forces of America and Britain, your unfailing wisdom,   high principles, and breadth of view have commanded the deep   respect and admiration of us all. Always you have honoured us by   your frankness, charmed us by your courtesy, and inspired us by   your singleness of purpose and your selfless devotion to our   common cause.    Above all would we record our thankfulness to you for the leading   part which you have always taken in forging and strengthening the   bond of mutual trust and cooperation between the armed forces of   our two countries which has contributed so much to final victory   and will, we believe, endure to the benefit of civilization in   the years to come.    In bidding farewell to you who have earned our personal affection   no less than our professional respect, we would address to you a   tribute written more than 200 years ago. …Friend to truth! Of soul sincere,     In action raithful, and in honour clear;     Who broke no promise, served no private end,     Who gained no title, and who lost no friend.»13 Between Mr. Stimson’s words of national   gratitude and the message from the British chiefs of staff, we   have General Marshall’s third biennial report which contains both   his military testament and an introduction to what later came to   be called the Marshall Aid.    It is particularly the last section of the report which is of   importance here. Marshall called it «For the Common   Defense». He opened with the statement that to fulfill its   responsibility for protection of the nation against foreign   enemies, the army must project its planning beyond the immediate   future. «For years men have been concerned with individual   security… But effective insurance against the disasters which   have slaughtered millions of people and levelled their homes is   long overdue.»14 He then   points to Washington’s plans for a national military policy and   goes on:    «We must start, I think, with a correction of the tragic   misunderstanding that a security policy is a war policy. War has   been defined by a people who have thought a lot about it – the   Germans. They have started most of the recent ones. The German   soldier-philosopher Clausewitz described war as a special violent   form of political action. Frederick of Prussia, who left Germany   the belligerent legacy which has now destroyed her, viewed war as   a device to enforce his will whether he was right or wrong. He   held that with an invincible offensive military force he could   win any political argument. It is the doctrine Hitler carried to   the verge of complete success. This is the doctrine of Japan. It   is a criminal doctrine, and like other forms of crime, it has   cropped up again and again since man began to live with his   neighbors in communities and nations. There has long been an   effort to outlaw war for exactly the same reason that man has   outlawed murder. But the law prohibiting murder does not of   itself prevent murder. It must be enforced. The enforcing power,   however, must be maintained on a strictly democratic basis. There   must not be a large standing army subject to the behest of a   group of schemers. The citizen-soldier is the guarantee against   such a misuse of power.»15    He concludes by emphasizing:    «If this Nation is to remain great, it must bear in mind now   and in the future that war is not the choice of those who wish   passionately for peace. It is the choice of those who are willing   to resort to violence for political advantage.»16    Marshall had hardly had a week’s rest after his resignation as   chief of staff when President Truman sent him to China as a special   ambassador to try to stop the pending civil war between the   Communists and the Kuomintang, i.e. Chiang Kai-shek. He   did not succeed; for when Marshall was gone, neither of the two   parties honored the agreements they had undertaken. But what   Marshall had seen and experienced in China strengthened the   conviction which the devastations of the war had planted in his   mind and which now received initial amplification in his report   from China to President Truman:    «It was his [Marshall’s] opinion that steps had to be taken   to assist China and its people in the increasingly serious   economic situation and to facilitate the efforts being made   toward peace and unity in China… General Marshall felt that   Chinese political and military unity could only be consolidated   and made lasting through the rehabilitation of the country and   the permanent general improvement of economic   conditions.»17    It is an opinion which Marshall in another connection has   formulated more generally in these words: «The historians   have failed in their task; they should have been able to discover   and reveal the causes of war and make war impossible.»    And when in 1947 Marshall at the insistent request of President   Truman accepted an appointment as secretary of state, it was   because he believed that he saw the causes of war and chaos and   because he intended to remove those causes insofar as humanly   possible, and in this way make war impossible.    His apprehension, his fear of war, his feeling that another war   would mean the complete collapse of human civilization is closely   akin to the apprehension in Nobel’s mind when he was drafting his   will. In 1893 he wrote in a letter18:    «I should like to dispose of a part of my fortune by   founding a prize to be given every five years (say six times; for   if we have not succeeded in reforming our present system within   thirty years we shall inevitably revert to barbarism).    This prize would be awarded to the man or woman who had achieved   most in furthering the idea of a general peace in   Europe.»    And he also wrote:    «Une nouvelle tyrannie-celle des bas fonds-s’agite dans les   ténèbres, et on croit entendre son grondement   lointain.»19    Marshall wanted to prevent what Nobel feared. Less than four   months after entering the State Department, he presented his plan   for that tremendous aid to Europe which has become inseparably   connected with his name. He stated in his famous speech at   Harvard   University:    «Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine   but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos. Its purpose   should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to   permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which   free institutions can exist. Such assistance, I am convinced,   must not be on a piecemeal basis as various crises develop. Any   assistance that this government may render in the future should   provide a cure rather than a mere palliative.»20    Marshall carried out his plan, fighting for it for two years in   public and in Congress. And when the Marshall Plan had become a   living reality, with the agencies for its operation established,   Marshall stepped back.    But again he was called to service, being made secretary of   defense in September, 1950. When he assumed this responsibility,   it was only to be in a position to put into effect his idea of   building the future defense of the United States on a democratic   conscription and not on a standing army. When this had been   accomplished, he retired once more, this time to realize at last   the dream of his life – to grow a vegetable garden on his small   estate in Virginia.    The years that have gone by since he submitted his program have   demonstrated its constructive character. And the organs which   have grown from the Marshall Aid have, more than anything else in   these difficult years, contributed to what Nobel termed «the   idea of a general peace in Europe» and to a realistic   materialization of the idea Nobel in his testament called   brotherhood among nations, although within a more narrow   framework than Marshall had desired.    The Nobel Peace Prize, therefore, is awarded to George Catlett   Marshall.    1. December 10, 1901.    2. Lt. Colonel Johnson Hagood,   commanding officer at Fort Douglas, Utah, 1916.

"32","1954","Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees","   The Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament has this year awarded the Peace Prize for 1954 to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. War has existed in all times – war between tribes, war between races, war between nations, civil wars and religious wars. War has always laid waste human dwellings, forcing men to flee to escape its horrors and to find a refuge where they might live in peace. But it is only during our own century that international work to help refugees has begun to take shape. The first High Commission for Refugees was established after World War I by the League of Nations as a result of the initiative of Fridtjof Nansen. No single man has contributed more to this cause than has Nansen, and the work he started has never paused since. I do not propose to review in detail the activity of the High Commission nor that of the International Labor Office nor yet the help that has been offered on all sides by private organizations and individuals. The work begun at an international level in 1921 was continued throughout the Second World War, for the refugee problem created by the first war had still not been solved at the outbreak of the next. During this last war, tens of millions of people lost their homes, either because they became refugees in their own country or because they were forcibly deported to other countries or else because they fled of their own accord. It has been estimated that there were between thirty and fifty million homeless at the end of the war. We can never be completely sure of such figures, but one thing at least is certain: when the firing ceased, there were millions of human beings without shelter, human beings who had to be helped to find a place where they could live in safety. Already in 1943 the Allies had set up the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The first task of this organization was to assist the countries which had been occupied to revive their economy. But another problem awaiting UNRRA at the end of hostilities was the care of those who had lost their homes as a result of the war and who were now in areas under Allied control. It was necessary to arrange for their repatriation. UNRRA did splendid work; its magnitude can be judged from the fact that its expenditure amounted to $3,900,000,000. The greater part of this sum was contributed by various governments, ninety percent coming from the United States and the United Kingdom alone. With the assistance of the military authorities, UNRRA succeeded in repatriating six million people by the autumn of 1945. But many more remained. Repatriation was not always easy to arrange. This was partly because of inadequate transport facilities, but also because of the frequently woeful conditions in the native country which made it impossible for the latter to take care of its own people. But there were also many people who did not want to return to their own countries, either because they no longer had ties there or because they feared reprisals from the governments then in power. These have become the real refugees, men for whom a chance of a new life must be found outside their native lands. After the United Nations had begun its activities, the refugee work was taken over on July 1, 1947, by the International Refugee Organization. IRO assumed responsibility both for the refugees who had previously been looked after by UNRRA and for those who had been rendered homeless in the interwar period, taking under its care a total of 1,700,000 people. Substantial progress was made through direct aid to refugees both inside and outside the camps. Thousands of people were rescued from hardship or even from death. But perhaps the greatest service that IRO rendered was that of helping about one million refugees to emigrate. The cost, however, was immense; during the few years of its existence IRO spent $470,000,000. In 1949 it was decided to wind up IRO, and its place has now been taken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Office began its work on January 1, 1951. It is a nonpolitical body, with social and humanitarian aims, its main purpose being to provide legal and political protection for the refugees. Under the terms of its Statute the mandate of the High Commissioner’s Office extends to all refugees, with the exception of the Arab refugees from Palestine and of the Korean refugees. Special organizations have been set up to help these.1 The terms of reference of the High Commission are carefully defined in its Statute. will give the essential points. The High Commissioner shall provide for the protection of refugees falling under the competence of his Office by: (a) Promoting the conclusion and ratification of international conventions for the protection of refugees, supervising their application and proposing amendments thereto; (b) Promoting through special agreements with Governments the execution of any measures calculated to improve the situation of refugees and to reduce the number requiring protection; (c) Assisting governmental and private efforts to promote voluntary repatriation or assimilation within new national communities; (d) Promoting the admission of refugees, not excluding those in the most destitute categories, to the territories of States; (c) Endeavoring to obtain permission for refugees to transfer their assets and especially those necessary for their resettlement; (f) Obtaining from Governments information concerning the number and conditions of refugees in their territories and the laws and regulations concerning them; (g) Keeping in close touch with Governments and intergovernmental organizations concerned; (h) Establishing contacts in such a manner as he may think best with private organizations dealing with refugee questions; (i) Facilitating the coordination of the efforts of private organizations concerned with the welfare of refugees.2 The task undertaken by the High Commission was a truly difficult and formidable one. The role it assumed may perhaps be described as that of protector of the refugees, acting as a vigilant conscience to some governments, forging cooperation among all others working for the cause of the refugees. But, unlike IRO, it could not play the role of the rich uncle freely dispensing gifts. The High Commissioner for Refugees cannot solicit voluntary contributions either from governments or from private charitable organizations without the authorization of the United Nations General Assembly. The consent of the General Assembly is also required before the High Commission can initiate repatriation or emigration of refugees. It has frequently been asked how the UN could relinquish its financial responsibility for the refugees and place the burden on countries which, because of their geographical location, had given shelter to the greatest number of refugees, and on the private and governmental organizations working for the refugees. The answer probably lies in the huge expenditures made by IRO, for it was said that the United Nations had no mandate to dispense charity. Moreover, the world was growing tired of the refugee problem. But then we have only to read the reports of debates held in the Assembly concerning the refugees, to be sharply reminded of the fact that the United Nations is a political organization where political considerations outweigh considerations concerning unfortunate human beings. One remembers the response Fridtjof Nansen met when he begged the League of Nations for help in the fight against famine in Russia3. The Office of the High Commissioner receives the funds for its administrative expenses from the United Nations. Its personnel is strictly limited, and even today, after nearly five years of existence, the administrative staff numbers scarcely more than a hundred. The Office headquarters are in Geneva and it has branch offices in fourteen countries4 so that its representatives, by being on the spot, can keep in close touch with the refugees, giving them any necessary protection and acting as intermediaries between them and the governments concerned. It soon became apparent that little effective work could be done for the refugees unless the Office itself had funds at its disposal. In 1952, therefore, the High Commissioner, Dr. van Heuven Goedhart, applied to the General Assembly for permission to raise three million dollars to provide the necessary funds. The General Assembly granted its consent, but it did so without enthusiasm even though no burden on the budget of the United Nations was involved. Dr. van Heuven Goedhart’s appeals to governments and private organizations raised the sum of $1,300,000 which has made it possible to relieve the most crying needs of the refugees. The expenditure connected with European refugees in Shanghai alone amounts to approximately $34,000 a month. The original intention was that the High Commissioner’s Office should operate for only three years. However, it has now been decided that its activities should continue until January 1, 19595, and the organization be authorized to raise $16,000,000 by voluntary contributions from governmental sources. Of this sum, only $4,200,000 is assured as of now. As I have mentioned, the basic task of the High Commissioner is to provide help and protection to the refugees. And so the Office has sought, by dint of untiring and sometimes thankless effort, to bring assistance to the refugees and to help the authorities understand their problems. This kind of work cannot be described in terms of figures. But think of what it means to the individual refugee to feel and to know that he has not been forgotten, that in spite of everything there is someone willing to help him, even if the help cannot be brought immediately. In addition, the provision of legal protection gives him some sense of security and so helps to maintain his morale and to encourage him to begin a new life. Nonetheless, such measures alone are not enough to solve the problem of the refugee. What then is the solution? The answer appears to be easy. It is simply to give each refugee a social, economic, and legal foundation on which he can rebuild his life. Yet it is in reality as difficult as it appears to be easy. The High Commissioner has himself indicated three principal ways to solve the problem. The first is to enable those refugees who so wish to return to their own country. But very few of today’s refugees wish to go back. Another way is to enable them to emigrate overseas. As already mentioned, IRO succeeded in helping a large number of refugees to resettle in other countries. But it was easier then than it is now, and IRO also had the funds to finance such emigration. There are yet other factors which now make it more difficult to solve the refugee problem with the aid of emigration: With the years that have passed, many refugees are approaching or have reached old age, and most countries who accept immigrants give precedence to those who are able to work and who can thus become useful citizens. For example, it frequently happens that a male refugee is granted an immigrant’s visa but that his family is rejected. It may be that certain members of the family are unwanted in the new country because of their poor health or old age. In such cases the man usually chooses to remain with them, for his family generally means more to him than his own future. But despite all the obstacles, the High Commission has done much to stimulate emigration. By appealing to other refugee organizations it has succeeded in promoting emigration to a considerable extent. I might mention by way of example the emigration of 33,000 refugees in 1953, arranged through the Intergovernmental Committee in Geneva6. A third possible way to solve the problem is to allow the refugees to remain permanently in the country of asylum and to give them citizenship status. But once again this has proved to be difficult to achieve. It might appear that such a plan could be more easily implemented than before in view of the improvement in the economic situation and the resulting high level of employment enjoyed by some countries harboring large numbers of refugees. Nevertheless, however willing a government may be in principle to grant foreigners work and residence permits, it must first look after the economic interests of its own citizens. We must look reality in the eye. The inhabitants of a country are seldom very anxious to admit foreigners, and government policy is all too often decided by lack of willingness on the part of the budgetary authorities. The economic resources have not always been plentiful either, and there are always many demands today which have higher priority. Nor should we forget that many refugees are living in countries which themselves have considerable unemployment. The High Commissioner has encountered all these difficulties and many others besides. But he has worked tirelessly to overcome them. When Dr. van Heuven Goedhart has submitted plans only to have them rejected, he has promptly submitted fresh ones. He has often been forced to reduce his demands, but he has never willingly given up until he has secured at least something. And many are the measures which the High Commissioner has succeeded in pushing through. One example of these is the project he submitted to the Austrian government with the object of finding employment in agriculture for refugees. In its final form this plan was not as comprehensive as Dr.van Heuven Goedhart would have wished, but it was carried through and proved highly successful. We must not forget that many of the refugees are capable people. Experience shows that they are hard-working and better at economizing than other men; after all, starting with only their bare hands, they strive to create a future for themselves and their families. What they need is to be helped to help themselves; and it has been observed that, if given loans, they are more conscientious about repaying them than many of those who receive assistance in all countries but accept it as a gift without ever thinking of paying it back. But we still have a long way to go before all refugees have been given such an opportunity. Some 300,000 refugees remain in Europe, 70,000 of them in camps. There are about 13,000 refugees of European origin in China, particularly in Shanghai, who have no hope of making a life for themselves there. The refugees both inside and outside Europe who come under the protection of the High Commissioner’s Office number some 2,200,000 in all. Ten years have passed since the war ended and the refugee camps still remain. Here we find the old and infirm and those whose occupations are such that they find it difficult to obtain work in a foreign country. The majority are professional men, among them many intellectuals. They are people who feel that they have nothing to look forward to, and many have given up all hope of a better future. But the camps also house children and young people who have never known any other home, and none of them, neither the old nor the young, have a native country which could give them help or protection. Until the camps are cleared, until the sick and old have been cared for, until the young people and the children have been educated and trained for a profession or trade, the refugee problem is not solved. Earlier organizations have done much for the refugees living in the camps, and the High Commissioner’s Office has carried on the good work. It has also managed to persuade some countries to accept and to look after the old and the ailing. Those who have been taken in by other countries include the blind and the old and even those struck down by tuberculosis. The aim is to bring all these unfortunate people back to a normal life. But it seems we will be a long time in reaching the goal. I recently heard a description of life in a refugee camp. To be sure, the refugees get enough food to keep them alive. But what else? Dreary hopelessness day after day, bad accommodations, worse than bad clothing and sanitation. Nothing to do but to sit there and wait and wait. For what? For something they no longer have any hope of realizing. Of what use is it to take a few children on a summer holiday in some country, only to send them back again to their camps? This is the Europe of today, where one nation after another prides itself on having achieved the welfare state. The Office of the High Commissioner does not have funds to change the situation, and the funds of private organizations do not stretch far enough. The High Commissioner has had the courage to state that deliverance can come only through common action and through financial support supplied by all in a united effort. There may perhaps be some who do not believe that work for the refugees is work in the cause of peace – although I have never actually heard this view expressed. But it is work for peace, if to heal the wounds of war is to work for peace, if to promote brotherhood among men is to work for peace. For this work shows us that the unfortunate foreigner is one of us; it teaches us to understand that sympathy with other human beings, even if they are separated from us by national frontiers, is the foundation upon which a lasting peace must be built. Today there are many who are active in the refugee cause. And it is the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees which is the focus for the work. It is an institution, an organization that has statutes as do all other institutions. But statutes are lifeless; it is people who infuse life. And it is Dr. van Heuven Goedhart and his colleagues who have shaped the High Commission and given it life, for in their constant, intense search for new solutions they have felt and shown sympathy and understanding for the refugees as human beings. The High Commissioner, Dr. van Heuven Goedhart, has never tired of proclaiming what he believes is right. It is good to know that there are people who dare to make a stand against soulless and bureaucratic authority. He and his colleagues represent the watchful conscience of our world. For these reasons, then, the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament, in testimony of its profound gratitude and admiration for you, Dr. van Heuven Goedhart, and for your colleagues, has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 1.

"33","1957","Lester Bowles Pearson"," The Nobel Committee of the Norwegian   Parliament has awarded Alfred Nobel’s Peace Prize for 1957 to   the Canadian Lester Bowles Pearson.    As we all know, Lester Pearson was Canada’s foreign minister from   1948 to 1957 when, as a result of the election, the Liberal   government resigned.    The winner of the Peace Prize for this year is, then, a   politician, and he is still a Liberal member of the Canadian   Parliament.    It can perhaps be said that what Lester Pearson has done to   prevent or to stop war would not have been possible had he not   been an active politician. That, of course, may be disputed. What   I want to emphasize is that the Peace Prize has not been awarded   to the politician or to the secretary of state as such, but to   the man Lester Pearson because of his personal qualities – the   powerful initiative, strength, and perseverance he has displayed   in attempting to prevent or limit war operations and to restore   peace in situations where quick, tactful, and wise action has   been necessary to prevent unrest from spreading and developing   into a worldwide conflagration.    Lester Bowles Pearson was born in Toronto, Canada, in 1897. His   father and grandfather enjoyed high reputations as Methodist   preachers, and the boy grew up in a religious but broad-minded   environment in which even athletics played an important part in   his training. His father saw to it that he received a good   education. He enrolled as a history student at the University of   Toronto, but his studies were interrupted during the First   World War when, at the age of eighteen, he joined the University   Medical Corps as a volunteer. At the end of the war in which he   eventually became an actual participant, he resumed his studies   and obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1919. After an   interval in his uncle’s meat processing plant, he won a   scholarship for studies at Oxford. In 1923 he took his Master of Arts degree.   He taught for some time, becoming an assistant professor of   modern history at the University of Toronto.    In 1928, when he was thirty-one years old, Lester Pearson entered   the service of the Canadian Department of External Affairs. This   step marked the end of his academic career and the beginning of   his life as a civil servant. He was first secretary at the   Department of External Affairs in Ottawa until 1935, when he was   appointed counselor at the Office of the High Commissioner for   Canada in London. He returned to Ottawa in 1941 as assistant   undersecretary of state at the Department of External Affairs,   and in the following year he was appointed Canadian minister in   Washington, where he stayed until 1946, for the last two years as   ambassador. Then followed two years as undersecretary of state at   home until – at the age of fifty-one he became secretary of state   for External Affairs in the Canadian government in 1948.    Such is the brief, prosaic data on Mr. Pearson’s career, a career   which, indeed, bears witness to great proficiency and   intelligence; but it reveals nothing concerning what he has   accomplished, how he has tackled the tasks with which he has been   confronted, or why he has solved problems in the manner he   has.    Naturally, during the period when Lester Pearson was a civil   servant at the Department of External Affairs, he could express   his views and opinions only to the Canadian government. It was,   however, during those years, which to him were largely an   apprenticeship, that he gathered his wide experience and   broadened his outlook. It was during that period that his views   on international problems took shape. He participated in the   World Disarmament Conference1 in   Geneva in 1933-1934, in the London Naval Conference2 in 1935, and during that same year in   the work of the Canadian delegation to the Sixteenth Assembly of   the League of Nations. These conferences cannot have been very   encouraging to Lester Pearson. All of us who had to do with the   League of Nations in those years felt that we were going from one   defeat to another. For the young Lester Pearson, however, just   taking part in all this, observing it at first hand, has no doubt   proved a valuable experience and contributed infinitely to what   he has later been able to accomplish.    The years in London from 1935 to 1941 at the Canadian High   Commissioner’s Office were very important and instructive for   Lester Pearson, in close and permanent contact as he was with   what was going on in Europe at that time.    He has given an appraisal of conditions in the Western European   democracies after the middle of the 1930’s. It is a violent   criticism of their domestic policy, as well as of their foreign   policy; at home, of their inability to master the economic   problems; abroad, of their hesitation and indulgence, their   yielding to Hitler again and again in the belief that peace could   thus be preserved – bringing them finally to the Munich crisis of   1938. Lester Pearson is said to have been one of the first   Canadians who recognized at an early stage that the way which had   been chosen would not lead to the desired end. War would have to   come.    From 1942 to 1946 Lester Pearson was in Washington, as I said, as   Canadian minister and ambassador. During that time he had more   and more opportunity to bring himself to the world’s attention;   he participated in the efforts to build the structure of peace,   efforts which started in 1943 long before the war was over.    His first remarkable contribution was made at the 1943 Conference   in Hot Springs3, which was   concerned with finding out how the world’s food and capital goods   were to be distributed in peacetime. Lester Pearson’s effective   part in this work was obvious. Gove Hambidge gives the following   description of him in his book The Story of FAO:   «Mike Pearson, young, modest, responsive, intelligent, and   possessed of a quick sense of humor and a flair for working out   effective compromises between opposing viewpoints, had made an   excellent impression at the Hot Springs Conference.»    He was elected chairman of the Interim Commission for Food and   Agriculture, which was appointed to prepare the plans for the   permanent organization FAO. Hambidge makes the following comment on his   work on that Commission: «More than any other person he was   responsible for steering the Interim Commission through two years   of successful work.»    At a meeting in Quebec in 1945, when FAO was established, the   work of the Commission came to an end. I would like to quote what   Lester Pearson himself said on that occasion because it shows so   clearly that he was already aware, at that early stage, that   international cooperation was threatened by the new progress of   science in the field of nuclear research. But his words also show   that he holds a vision of a better world for mankind, a world   without fear and without want.    This is what he said: «We at this Conference know, and we   have shown, what science could do if harnessed to the chariot of   construction. Man’s fears have, however, harnessed it also to   another chariot – that of atomic obliteration. On that chariot   race, with science driven by both contestants, all our hopes and   fears and agonies and ecstasies are concentrated. If we lose in   that contest, anything that we have done here or may do elsewhere   in London, or Washington, or San Francisco, or Moscow will have   as much consequence as a pebble thrown into the Gulf of St.   Lawrence. But if we should acquire some trace of sanity and bring   social progress in line with scientific development by subjecting   the annihilating forces of science to some sort of social   control, which in the last analysis means some sort of   international control, then the work we have done at Quebec will   have made a worthy and permanent contribution to man’s long   effort to move upward from the jungle of hatred, suspicion, and   death where so many powerful, selfish, and frightening influences   even today are working to keep him mired.»    This was said in 1945. Twelve years have passed since then, and   we have been witnessing just such a race, menacing and fatal   because, if it continues, there can be scarcely a doubt about the   outcome: the extermination or decay of a large part, if not the   whole, of mankind.    The fact that this is a reality must have contributed greatly to   Mr. Pearson’s views on the international conflicts of our time   and must, more than anything else, have influenced his   convictions about the way in which such conflicts ought to be   resolved.    At about the same time the plans for FAO were being made, Lester   Pearson took part in organizing UNRRA4, which was set up mainly for the   purpose of reestablishing the economy of the war-ravaged   countries after the war was over. The organization was also to   take care of the displaced persons who had lost their homes as a   result of war and persecution. UNRRA was founded in 1943, and   Lester Pearson became the chairman of its Supply Committee. In   1946 he was made chairman of the Subcommittee for Displaced   Persons.    Lester Pearson’s efforts in UNRRA bear the mark of the same   personal qualities which he displayed during the organization of   FAO. He undertook the work because he believed in a better world   for mankind. He carried it out by approaching the problems in a   matter-of-fact way. After a meeting of the Council of UNRRA in   1944, he said: «So UNRRA must not merely do its job well; it   must do it so well that it will give heart and courage to the   governments who, slowly but steadily, are building up the   international structure of peace; so well that it will, by its   example, bring hope to men and women, who, if that structure   falls, will again be crushed beneath its ruins.»    In 1946 Lester Pearson returned to Ottawa where he became   secretary of state for External Affairs in 1948. He held that   position for nine years.    During this period Mr. Pearson has had a part in most of the   important conferences which have been held for the solution of   international problems. His chief contribution to international   politics, however, has been made within the framework of the United Nations   Organization.    As early as 1945 at the San Francisco Conference, where the   United Nations Charter was formulated, he had been   an adviser to the Canadian delegation. He was the one who argued   on behalf of Canada against the veto of the great powers – an   argument he continued in the meetings of the General Assembly of   the United Nations. I would mention that he strongly supported   the «Uniting for Peace» Resolution of 1950. That   resolution offers the following possibility: when a war of   aggression comes up for consideration and the Security Council is   prevented from operating by the veto of one of the great powers,   the General Assembly can be convened at fortyeight hours’ notice.   In other words, this resolution reduces the effect of the veto of   a great power.    As far as he has been able to do so, Lester Pearson has   endeavored to improve the efficiency of the United Nations, to   enable that organization to operate as quickly and effectively as   possible.    During the time in which the United Nations has been in   existence, one international conflict after another has arisen,   and the moral strength of the organization has been put to a   severe test.    The first really important conflict which the UN had to deal with   was the question of Palestine. This matter was considered in a   special session in 1947. Mr. Pearson was elected chairman of the   Political Committee, and the Special Committee on Palestine   recommended that the British mandate over Palestine should be   discontinued and that the country should be divided into a Jewish   and an Arab state. The recommendation of the committee was   considered at the Second General Assembly. The question of   division was then dealt with by an ad hoc committee in   which Mr. Pearson participated very actively. And indeed the   recommendation had a positive result. The Palestine problem was   actually put to rest for some time5.    Since then Mr. Pearson has taken part in all the meetings of the   General Assembly, except in 1955, and he was its president in   1952. Every time he has made significant contributions – although   I cannot here refer to all the different matters which have come   up for consideration. I would only call attention to his attitude   during the fighting in Korea, when he was in favor of limiting   hostilities as soon as the aggressors6 had been forced back. He dissociated   himself entirely from those who wanted to proceed with the war   until – as it was said – «final victory had been   won».    This is what Pearson himself has said about the fighting in   Korea: «The action of free nations against aggression in   Korea has been limited and has had as its purpose not the   destruction of the North Korean and Chinese peoples, but the   localizing of hostilities, repelling the attack, and then   negotiating cease-fire arrangements as a prelude to   peace.»    These words reflect his realistic and positive attitude, an   attitude he has maintained consistently – not just in the Korean   conflict. If it is not possible to stop an aggression without   using arms, then call off the fighting as soon as the immediate   aim has been achieved, he advises; do not go further, but try to   create a situation in which it is possible to work for the   ultimate goal, which is peace.    The next time the world was threatened by a conflagration of   unforeseeable extent was in 1956. It all seems so close to us,   and we all remember the course of events.    At the end of July, 1956, Nasser suddenly proceeded to   nationalize the Suez Canal. The Suez conflict was brought before   the Security   Council in September, and it seemed that it might be possible   to find a solution.    Then, on October 29, Israel marched into Egyptian territory. On   the 30th the French-British ultimatum was handed to Egypt, and   the next day both these countries proceeded to the attack.    The Security Council, which immediately called on the aggressors   to cease hostilities, was made inoperative by the veto of Great   Britain and France.    The matter then came up before the General Assembly, and on   November 2, a resolution was put to the vote which required the   aggressors to stop fighting immediately.    Before this resolution was submitted, Lester Pearson had been   working unceasingly night and day, through conferences and   informal talks, to give the resolution a wider scope,   sufficiently comprehensive to form a real basis for a solution of   the conflict and for creating peace. With his rich experience,   his positive attitude, and his determined vigor, he pointed out   that the resolution lacked any provision for solving the problem   itself. He felt that this was a matter of decisive importance in   that critical phase of the developments when the world was at the   very edge of disaster.    But Lester Pearson did not give up his efforts even though the   Resolution of November 2 did not contain what he had wanted. In   the acutely dangerous situation other ways out would have to be   found. On November 4 he submitted to the General Assembly a   resolution in which the Secretary-General was requested to put   before the General Assembly within forty-eight hours a plan for   an international United Nations force to be employed in the area   of fighting to secure and supervise the cessation of hostilities.   As we all know, this was done.    Never, since the end of the last war, has the world situation   been darker than during the Suez crisis, and never has the United   Nations had a more difficult case to deal with. However, what   actually happened has shown that moral force can be a bulwark   against aggression and that it is possible to make aggressive   forces yield without resorting to power. Therefore, it may well   be said that the Suez crisis was a victory for the United Nations   and for the man who contributed more than anyone else to save the   world at that time. That man was Lester Pearson.    During the Hungarian Revolution7   Lester Pearson spoke at the emergency special session of the   General Assembly. He strongly advocated that an independent   international authority should «enable all the Hungarian   people, without fear of reprisal, to establish a free and   democratic government of their own choice». «Why»,   he asked, «should we not now establish a suitable United   Nations mission for Hungary when it has been agreed to form a   United Nations authority in the Middle East?»    During the Hungarian Revolution, however, the United Nations   remained powerless.    Mr. Pearson has frequently been mentioned as one of the most   enthusiastic supporters of NATO8. In   this organization for defense of countries whose life pattern is   based on democracy and personal freedom, he finds a guarantee for   the maintenance of peace and human rights in the world. He has   made great efforts to extend the cooperation among NATO countries   to include the political, economic, and cultural fields.    Lester Pearson would be the last to believe that military force   can secure peace in the long run. This is what he said in   1955:    «No person, no nation, no group of nations can view with   comfort, however, the prospects for a world where peace rests   primarily on the deterrent effect of collective military strength   and regional political unity. That discomfort becomes deep   anxiety in the face of the fantastic development of nuclear   weapons and their inclusion in the armament of a few big powers   now, and of many other powers soon. This makes it more than ever   necessary, while maintaining military strength, to put forth any   possible effort to reduce the danger of war and gradually make   such strength unnecessary.    In all the long story of mankind, arms alone, however powerful,   have never been sufficient to guarantee security for any length   of time. Your strength for defense becomes the weakness of those   against whom you feel you must be ready to defend yourself. Your   security becomes their insecurity; so they in turn seek safety in   increased arms. A vicious circle commences which in the past has   cost untold misery and destruction and might now, if we cannot   cut through it, cause mankind’s extinction. Even adequate   collective force for defence, then, is no final solution. It is   merely a means to an end – peace based on something more enduring   than force.»    Lester Pearson’s vision is not that of a dreamer. He looks at   life and the conditions of the world as they are, basing his   conclusions on realities. One may say that his visionary ideal   has been constructed of the materials of experience.    I have had to confine myself to some of the main features of   Lester Bowles Pearson’s activities to prevent or to stop war, and   I am quite aware that I have given only an account of the result   of his efforts, and not a living picture of the man himself.   That, however, is not easy to do in the case of a man like Lester   Pearson, whose work has been carried out largely on the   diplomatic level – in commissions, at meetings, and during   discussions of an informal character.    Only those who have taken part in conferences together with   Lester Pearson have been able to witness his never tiring   determination and his exceptional ability to put forward   constructive ideas for the solution of a problem. If his proposal   was rejected, he optimistically proceeded to engage his   resourcefulness in finding another solution for which – thanks to   the experience just gained – he might perhaps more readily win   acceptance. For him the main thing was never to give up, but   always to try to advance at least one step toward the goal.    Lester Pearson is far from being a compromising man when a vital   point is at issue. However, he feels that the basis of any   negotiations on international problems must be an attempt to   understand the other party and to meet him halfway in order to   establish a basis of confidence. It is only when confidence has   been built up that it is possible to proceed with the   negotiations with any hope of reconciliation.    However, in this work one must never betray the principles on   which the United Nations Charter is based. In other words, one   must work toward economic and social progress and away from   poverty; toward full and free self-government and away from   dictatorial regimes imposed from inside or from outside; toward a   progressive realization of human rights and the dignity and worth   of the individual person.    Lester Pearson believes that the time will come when it is   possible, through the United Nations, to realize the dream of a   worldwide community of all nations and races, and he feels that   just acknowledging such an ideal in some form serves to remind us   of our ultimate and underlying kinship even with our opponents.   There is a value to this which, if we retain any humility, we   will not underestimate.    Lester Pearson’s work has been carried on during a period of   tension and open conflict, not only among nations but between   races and different civilizations. At the same time, technical   development has brought countries closer together and made them   more mutually dependent upon one another. Any conflict that   breaks out anywhere today will involve practically the whole   world.    «We are now emerging into an age», Lester Pearson says,   «when different civilizations will have to learn to live   side by side in peaceful interchange, learning from each other,   studying each other’s history and ideals, art and culture,   mutually enriching each other’s lives. The only alternative in   this overcrowded little world is misunderstanding, tension,   clash, and – catastrophe».    The fact that the world may have to face the choice between to be   and not to be and the fact that it has been left to us ourselves   to decide whether life or death shall prevail, make it more   necessary than ever before that we choose the right way; we must   not let any conceivable method remain untried in our efforts to   solve international conflicts in a peaceful way. Here, the goal   will not be reached unless the people whose task it is to resolve   the conflicts show no sign of failing in their will for peace and   in their efforts to attain it.    As Lester Pearson has expressed it, «In our day the penalty   for failure – or for serious blundering – is far greater than   ever before. Mankind can no longer afford error.»    And still, no matter how dark the outlook for the world may be,   Lester Pearson is no pessimist. Had he been pessimistic, he could   not have found the endurance and strength which he has displayed   in his work. His efforts would not have been possible had he not   been supported by a strong faith in the final victory of the good   forces of life.    In conclusion, I quote from a lecture which Lester Pearson gave   at Princeton University in 1955:    «The fact is, that to every challenge given by the threat of   death and destruction, there has always been the response from   free men: It shall not be. By these responses man has not only   saved himself, but has ensured his future.    May it be so again this time, as we face the awful and the   glorious possibilities of the nuclear age.»    1.

"34","1958","Georges Pire","   The Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament has this year awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the Belgian Dominican, Father Georges Pire, for his efforts to help refugees to leave their camps and return to a life of freedom and dignity. Father Pire’s work is known to all of us in Western Europe. We have read in the newspapers of this man who, on his own initiative, has set himself the task of rescuing the handicapped refugees, the «Hard Core», or the residue. These are the old and infirm who remained in the camps, doomed to stay there without hope of a brighter future, men for whom our hard, ruthless world, which has taken Efficiency and Working Capacity as its idols, has had no further use. Just seven weeks ago, we in Oslo had the pleasure of hearing Father Pire speak of his work for these refugees1. His talk in the Great Hall of the University was reported in the national press; so most of us in Norway are acquainted with both the practical ventures he has launched and the difficulties which he has encountered. Father Pire told us then that his aim was not merely to rescue individuals from material want, but also to restore to each of these unfortunate human beings the self-confidence dulled by the many years languished away in refugee camps. As everyone must know, the refugee problem in the form and magnitude which we know today is a legacy of the two world wars. It is one of the blackest stains on the twentieth century. But a great deal has also been done for the refugees. When the last war ended in 1945, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was charged with the care of the homeless. Later on, its duties were taken over by the International Refugee Organization. Both of these organizations have since been dissolved and the mission was in turn entrusted to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, whose achievements have been and still are vitally important. It was in recognition of these that this institution was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1955 [for 1954]. In my speech on that occasion, I tried to describe the work which was being done to secure a legal position for the refugees, to help them to find work in the countries in which they had settled or, as the High Commissioner, Dr.van Heuven Goedhart, expressed it then, to give every single refugee an economic, legal, and social foundation that would enable him to build up a new life by his own efforts. But even in 1955, ten years after the end of the war, there were still 300,000 refugees in Europe, 70,000 of these living in camps. The High Commissioner told me at the time that he was driven to despair by the many obstacles he encountered in his work. And most difficult of all was to overcome the extreme reluctance to accept the refugees, regarded simply as unwelcome foreigners. A great deal has been done since then to ease their lot, not least by the numerous private refugee organizations existing in various countries of the Western world. But the most difficult problem of all still remains: that of rescuing all those who can be saved only by the help which one human being can give to another, by creating the personal contact necessary to restore to the refugee the faith and confidence that he will again be able to live as a human being among others. It is to this labor that Father Pire has devoted himself and it is here that his great contribution lies. Father Pire himself tells us that it was on February 27, 1949, when he was thirty-nine years old, that he suddenly became poignantly aware of the refugee problem. Until that day he had, as a Dominican priest, been actively engaged in helping the suffering, and especially the children. But a conversation with a colonel in UNRRA awakened him to the plight of the refugees, and he began to ask himself what he could personally do to save some of the displaced persons who were still detained in the camps and who were in the majority old and infirm, with little hope of building up a new existence for themselves and their families by their own endeavor. It is obvious that effective help for this category of refugee must be very difficult because it is to all intents and purposes impossible to think in terms of loans, the arrangement frequently adopted in the case of the young emigrant refugees, who were fit and trained for work. Help for the old people must, at least to begin with, be built entirely on men’s unselfish desire to help their fellowmen, on their will to give practical proof of compassion and love. Father Pire began with an attempt to establish a sponsorship scheme; that is to say, he tried to place refugee families living in the camps in contact with private individuals, or «godparents», who were willing to write to them, send parcels and perhaps money. Today 15,000 «godparents» from twenty countries correspond with 15,000 refugees. In other words, refugees have been put in touch with people outside the camps who, they know, have a kind thought for them. Just imagine what joy the arrival of letters and parcels must bring to them! They have in this way a tangible proof of someone’s willingness to reach out a helping hand. But, and this is a big but, their own place is still in the camps and only in the camps. By visiting the refugees, Father Pire has learned to know what this means. And so, in 1950, he began his work to help the refugees to leave the camps. In the first place, there was the problem of the old people. Within four years he had succeeded in founding four homes for the old people, all in Belgium, where they, to use Father Pire’s own words, «are left in peace to dream of their lost homeland». Here they are provided with shelter, clothing, food, medicine, and here they will be cared for until they die. It can be seen, then, that Father Pire’s faith in the goodness of men, his confidence in their capacity to show compassion for their fellows, have proved to be well founded, for all these homes for the aged are the result of voluntary work and of donations of money from private individuals. But at the back of it all stands the personality of Georges Pire, who has managed to awaken in others the urge to help those in need. That was the beginning. But most of us know how Father Pire’s work expanded, how he, both by his own efforts and with the help of others like him, has in the past three years founded his five European Villages for refugees, the first in Aachen, one in Bregenz in Austria, a third in Augsburg. The fourth, near Brussels, is named after Fridtjof Nansen, and on September 21 of this year in the Saar was laid the foundation stone for the latest village, which is to bear the name of Albert Schweitzer. Father Pire had in 1950 formed a society named Aid to Displaced Persons (L’Aide aux personnes déplacées). This was a Belgian organization and had its headquarters in Georges Pire’s home village of Huy. The society became an international organization in 1957 and, after Father Pire had embarked on his scheme for European Villages, rapidly broadened its scope of activity. Article III of its statutes provides as follows: «The Society has as its aim to provide stateless refugees, regardless of their nationality or religion, with material or moral support in every form and especially through assistance by sponsorship, nursing homes, and European Villages, and to forge a chain of forces for good around the refugees who are without country, in the form of Europe of the Heart.» The Society is run by an administrative council composed of seven members, at present two Belgians, one German, one Austrian, one Frenchman, one Swiss, and one from Luxembourg. The president of the society and chairman of the council is Georges Pire. At the present time the organization has branches in Belgium, Austria, Germany, France, Luxembourg, and Switzerland, and national secretariats in Denmark and Italy. As I have said, Father Pire’s homes for the old owe their existence to voluntary work and to donations from individuals. In fact, when building these homes, Georges Pire had to give an undertaking to the Belgian government that he would not ask for help from official sources. The same conditions were imposed on his subsequent work which has been financed solely from private contributions. Is it then surprising that Father Pire spends a large part of his time in raising money for his projects? For Father Pire never begs, and we must remember that the vast proportion of the cash received is donated in small sums from people of average income. Shortly before the Belgian society was transformed into an international organization, Father Pire and his closest collaborators had founded another society whose aim was the relief of every form of distress in whatever part of the world it might arise. This organization took the name Europe of the Heart in the Service of the World (L’Europe du coeur au service du monde) and invited all countries to become members without regard to any division, whether of frontier or religion, language or culture. In this way it has progressed far beyond the refugee work in Europe, for now Father Pire appeals to all that is best in the West European, exhorting him to promote the feeling of brotherhood among men and asking him to face his responsibilities to the inhabitants of the rest of the world. I have tried to give a brief outline of Father Pire’s work: his sponsorship scheme for refugees, his homes for the old, and his European Villages. I have described his intentions in creating Europe of the Heart in the Service of the World. If his achievement is judged solely on the number of refugees he has rescued, then some might say that it is not great. But, as is so often the case, it would be dangerous to judge on the basis of numbers alone. Of far greater importance are the spirit which has animated Georges Pire in his mission and the seed he has sown in the hearts of men, for they give us the hope of a harvest to come: man’s selfless work for his needy fellowman. At the age of eighteen, Georges Pire entered the Dominican monastery of La Sarte in Belgium. His training consisted of one year’s novitiate, three years of philosophical studies, and four years of theological studies. His interest in social problems directed him to the study of sociology and, having taken his doctorate in 1936, he studied moral philosophy and sociology at Louvain University. Thus far Georges Pire had followed the path trodden by so many other Dominicans. The Dominican Order, according to one of its members, has always been very intellectual in character and is marked by the pursuit of study and learning, especially in the fields of philosophy and theology. The order has therefore always had close connections with university life. His studies, reading, and work at the University seem to have meant a great deal to Father Pire. University life should give a person a wider horizon and make him less bound by dogma. But intellectualism can often become sterile and turn a man into an onlooker remote from the world of reality. Father Pire, however, did not withdraw into the shell of the intellectual. His university life seems to have left him free from narrow dogmatism in his attitude to men. But apart from this, it is assuredly something much deeper, something quite unconnected with learning, which has inspired Father Pire in his work. Might this not be his profound desire to give practical expression to his love for his fellowmen? In his speech here in Oslo, Father Pire said that each human being is of infinite value, that love is our greatest asset on this earth and that we give it concrete form by practicing it in our relations with each individual. He sees it in this way: Try by loving your neighbor to reach the individual person. This is what he has tried to achieve by his method of helping the refugees through sponsors, homes for the old, and the Villages. There may perhaps be some who find it difficult to understand that the best way to help the refugees can be to build villages. I have heard it said that to collect refugees in villages is to isolate them from the society into which their children must one day grow up. It may appear so. But then we must remember that the refugees whom Father Pire wishes to rescue are not the healthy and the young ones. His refugee friends, isolated and alone as they are, cannot be thrown suddenly into new and foreign surroundings to make their own way. Here in Oslo Father Pire said of his refugees: «They have been sitting on their luggage and waiting twelve or fourteen years for a train that never comes.» It is for them that Father Pire’s villages are intended, so that carefully, little by little, they may be blended into the new society while still feeling secure and protected against the prejudice and ill will with which foreigners are often received. Father Pire has named two of his villages after Fridtjof Nansen and Albert Schweitzer. He frequently refers to Nansen, a man who was never a member of any particular church but who, in his great work for refugees, for prisoners of war, for the victims of the famine in Russia, followed the precept of brotherly love. Albert Schweitzer too has lived his whole life by the same principle, applying it to everything he has done, although he has never been a believer in dogmas. In the eyes of Father Pire, all are in the service of good who, without regard for religion, color, or nationality, carry out their work in this troubled world of ours in the spirit of brotherly love. Father Pire’s work for the refugees was undertaken to heal the wounds of war. But he looks much further ahead for, as he has said himself, our aim must be «to erect a bridge of light and love high above the waves of colonialism, anti-colonialism, and racial strife». Indeed, we must do more than that, we must by our actions spread the gospel of brotherhood among men, nations, and races. This is the ideal expressed by Alfred Nobel in his testament when he decreed that the Peace Prize should be awarded to the one who has done the most or the best work for the cause of brotherhood among nations. For this reason the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament is today pleased and honored to present the Peace Prize for 1958 to Father Georges Pire. 1. The laureate was then in Oslo to speak at a meeting of the Norwegian chapter of the European Movement."
"35","1959","Philip Noel-Baker"," Frequently when the storm clouds gather –   perhaps for that very reason – the world is made aware of the   forces of good, rallying to meet the threatened danger. The dark   years of this century in Europe started in 1914 and are still   with us. Throughout this span of time, for forty-five years,   Philip John Noel-Baker has dedicated his efforts to the service   of suffering humanity, whether in time of war or in the intervals   between wars. But above all else, his efforts to prevent war   breaking out have been tireless and ceaseless.    We saw Philip Noel-Baker as a young man serving in the Quaker   Ambulance Unit in France and Italy during the First World War; we   saw him, standing at Fridtjof   Nansen‘s side during the latter’s great work of relief in   Russia and Greece. He continued after the Second World War to try   to solve the refugee problem that the war had created. And   throughout this time, ever since the armistice of 1918, we have   heard him proclaiming the cause of disarmament and peace. What   disappointments we have suffered since then; and yet, not for a   moment did it occur to Noel-Baker to abandon hope that in the   future it would be possible to find a solution to political   conflicts, not by arms, but through negotiation.    Philip Noel-Baker is probably today the man who possesses the   greatest store of knowledge on the subject of disarmament and who   best knows the difficulties involved. In his latest book,   published in 1958, The Arms Race, which he has called A   Programme for World Disarmament, he has pointed out the way   we should go.    We detect in Philip Noel-Baker scarcely a trace of ambition for   himself. For him the cause, and it alone, matters. If that can be   furthered, it is a matter of indifference to him who gets the   credit.    So marked is this selfless and idealistic attitude that it is   difficult to explain unless one knows something about the milieu   in which he was brought up.    For generations his family has belonged to the Society of Friends,   or Quakers.   His father, Joseph Allen Baker, was born in Canada, where the   family had emigrated from Ireland in 1819. In the late 1870’s   Allen Baker was sent by his father to England to take charge of a   newly established branch of the family business. There he married   the deeply religious Elizabeth Balmer Moscrip. Their son, Philip   John, was born in 1889. Allen Baker’s life in England helps to   explain the milieu which must have been largely responsible for   shaping his son’s character and selfless, constructive attitude   to life.    Inspired by the Quakers’ feeling of responsibility for brothers   in need and by their eagerness to help, Allen Baker devoted his   time to a wide range of welfare activities in the London familiar   to us after the end of the nineteenth century. He came into close   contact with the London slums, establishing schools and even   teaching personally those who could not read and write, as well   as working for improved housing, temperance, and better traffic   conditions. In the course of time this work led to his becoming a   member of the London County Council. From 1900 to 1918 he was a   member of Parliament where he was to be found in the radical wing   of the Liberal Party. As a politician he devoted most of his time   to work for peace. As the fatal year of 1914 loomed ominously   near, he was indefatigable in his work to forge links between   peace lovers in all countries. With his religious background and   approach, he considered it essential that Christians in different   countries should unite to oppose war, especially those in Germany   and England. Allen Baker’s efforts proved in vain, and 1914   arrived. Instead of giving way to doubts and dismay, he was   inspired anew by Woodrow   Wilson‘s idea of a League of Nations.    There is little doubt that the influence and inspiration of a   cultured and harmonious family life, with father and mother   working selflessly to help those in need, inevitably left their   mark on the son’s attitude to life.    Philip Noel-Baker had the advantage of an academic education,   something his father had lacked all his life. His schooling   commenced at a Quaker school in York. In 1906, at the age of   seventeen, he studied at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, and from   1908 to 1912 he was an undergraduate at Cambridge University.   His major subject was international law, in which he has a   degree. He also studied at the Sorbonne and in Munich during the   year preceding the First World War. He was Cassel Professor of   International Relations at London University from 1924 to 1929.    I have mentioned his education because his academic schooling was   to have considerable influence on his later work. In all he has   said and written he has never succumbed to the temptation of   making a statement that was not well founded on meticulous   documentation. He never brushes the arguments of his opponents   aside, but submits them to an unbiased examination and criticism.   He endeavors to understand those who do not agree with him; he   does not censure their views; and only after he has proved that   their position is untenable does he deliver judgment.    Noel-Baker was twenty-six years old when the First World War   began. As a Quaker he was against taking an active part in the   war. He formed the Quakers’ Ambulance Unit and served in it   himself behind the front lines in France. In Italy he served with   the British Ambulance Unit under Trevelyan1.    Noel-Baker’s entire bent of mind, his upbringing, his experience   of war – all these things must inevitably have drawn him, as soon   as the war was over, to the work directed at righting some of the   wrongs created by the war. Above all he must have felt himself   called upon to do everything in his power to prevent any new   wars. It was therefore natural that he should seek association   with the new international organization, the League of   Nations.    Those who never knew the years after the First World War will   find it hard to realize how many hopes were pinned to the League   of Nations. For the first time an association of states had been   formed, an institution whose aim was the prevention of war and   the promotion of international cooperation in every possible   sphere, especially in welfare, in health, and in the economic   area. Many people saw in the League an instrument for creating a   new age, even though such countries as Russia, Germany, and the   United States were not members. The League, they believed, would   realize a hope which most people at that time cherished, the hope   that this had been the war to end war.    Soon after the cessation of hostilities, Noel-Baker was posted to   the section of the Foreign Office dealing with plans for the   League of Nations. In 1919 he accompanied Sir Robert Cecil as his secretary to the   peace negotiations in Paris. He assisted in drafting the Covenant   of the League of Nations and of the International Labor Organization.   Shortly afterwards he was appointed head of the Mandate Section   of the League of Nations.    In 1920 an important era in Noel-Baker’s life began. This was the   year his work with Fridtjof Nansen started, work which was to   last as long as Nansen lived. There is no need for me to mention   Nansen’s tremendous humanitarian work in Russia, in Greece, and   in Asia Minor. This is known to all of us. But I should like to   emphasize that in all this work Noel-Baker participated, not only   as a helper, but as Nansen’s friend. I have had the opportunity   of going through some of the correspondence between these two men   during this period, and it sheds a great deal of light on the   contribution made by Noel-Baker. He worked unobtrusively, away   from the glare of publicity, continuing to act as Nansen’s   adviser during the years the latter represented Norway in the   League of Nations. Writing to him in 1927, Nansen says:    My dear Baker,      I feel ashamed. I should have written to you   long ago to thank you with all my heart for your coming to Geneva   and for the splendid help you gave me. You know well enough what   it means for me, but it was always like that. I do not know how I   could have got on without you. Of course, all I have done in the   League has been done with you, and could not have been done   without you, at least not in the manner it was achieved. And so   it has been from the very beginning and till now. Oh dear friend,   how much you have done for me and for the League during many   years and how much time you have given to it.      I only wish this work for others could give you   more personal satisfaction. It is well enough to work unselfishly   for high ideals, but still, as we live in this world, it would be   gratifying, at least to others, to see the workers get their   due.    Here in Norway we are too apt to think of Noel-Baker only as   Nansen’s assistant and friend. But this part of his life is only   one of many chapters. From the time the letter I have quoted was   written and up to the present, more than three decades have   passed, years which for Noel-Baker have been filled with   unflagging work for disarmament.    Although Noel-Baker spent a comparatively short time as an   official of the League of Nations, he continued actively in the   work of the League, first as Sir Robert Cecil’s personal adviser   at the meetings of the Council and in the Assembly, later in   disarmament work as adviser to Arthur Henderson, and finally in the   Disarmament Commission from 1931 to 1933. He also followed the   work of the League of Nations in other fields.    He has recorded his experiences and his personal views on the   major questions under discussion at that time, in his books   The Geneva Protocol (1925), Disarmament (1926),   The Coolidge Conference (1927), and The Private   Manufacture of Armaments (1936).    Which of us today remembers the Geneva Protocol2 and the discussions it aroused? Then,   as now, it was the fear of handing over any part of one’s   national sovereignty, as well as the misgivings of the experts,   that killed the Protocol. The situation at that time was such   that the Protocol might have laid the basis for arbitration and   confidence, which in turn would have facilitated disarmament. As   Noel-Baker himself writes: «Our generation must get rid of   the militarization of the world, and above all of Europe, which   the preceding generation thrust upon it. It is a deep-rooted and   malignant disease for which palliatives do not suffice, and of   which civilized society may die if it be not ended.»3    But the Protocol, which was truly a step in the right direction,   was quietly shelved and left to molder with other documents, for,   then as now, Noel-Baker’s words applied: «Those who believe   that international institutions can be made and have been made to   work, want now to go forward. Those who doubt it,   hesitate.»4 It was the   latter who triumphed on this occasion.    In his book Disarmament, Noel-Baker discusses all the   aspects of the question and expresses the view that international   disarmament lies within the bounds of possibility. Being the   realist that he is, however, he devotes considerable space to the   difficulties which disarmament will encounter, chief among them   being the acceptance of reciprocal control. He says: «It   will no doubt be thought by many that such a scheme will never,   in fact, be generally accepted, because it would involve a   sacrifice of military liberty to which no Government in   present-day conditions, can be expected to agree.»5    To those who hold this opinion he replies: «And are there   not new overriding interests, which, for all Governments, now   that a great new international policy is by their common consent   to be adopted, should come before the old shibboleths of freedom   and secrecy in military preparation-shibboleths which, so far, be   it noted, have failed to bring us security from   war?»6    In his book The Private Manufacture of Armaments,   Noel-Baker has collected a wealth of material to reveal the role   this industry has played. At that time a great many people   believed that private ownership of the armaments industry was a   material factor in provoking rearmament. They maintained that,   once private ownership could be abolished and the armaments   industry run by the state, one of the most important reasons for   the armaments race would be removed. Developments have shown that   the situation has hardly improved with the state as owner. But   Noel-Baker’s book points out that the reason the private   armaments industry played as important a role as it did, was that   it worked hand in glove with the government of the country. Then,   as now, it was the policy of the state that proved   decisive.    All that Noel-Baker has written reflects his tremendous depth of   knowledge, and the soundness, shrewdness, and eminent common   sense of his views give his books a value far beyond the age in   which they were written.    And yet, it is not through his writing but in his personal   activities that Noel-Baker has made his greatest contribution. I   do not think it an exaggeration to say that he has had some share   in practically all the work that has been carried out to promote   international understanding in its widest sense, and this is true   of him both as a private individual and as a representative of   his country. It would be impossible to do full justice to his   manifold activities in this connection without recapitulating in   detail important sections of the history of the League of Nations   and of international politics during the interwar years, a task   that would make my speech interminable.    In 1929 Noel-Baker was elected to the House of Commons as a Labor   member, and in the 1930’s he was one of the Labor Party’s   foremost spokesmen in advancing the view that England, in her   foreign policy, should follow the lines laid down by the League   of Nations. This attitude was reflected, as on other occasions,   in his bitter resistance to the suggestion that England should   abandon her sanctions against Italy after Mussolini’s invasion of   Ethiopia7. He was against   England’s policy of nonintervention in the Spanish Civil   War8, and he criticized the   vacillating attitude of the British government toward nazism. He   was himself a member of a group, led by Churchill, which   tried to organize resistance against Fascist and Nazi   encroachment. In order to give moral support to threatened   nations, he visited Czechoslovakia as a representative of the   Labor Party, and subsequently Finland. In his own country,   Noel-Baker helped to found the League of Nations Union and was   one of the most active members of the peace movement, which   enjoyed tremendous support in the 1930’s.    But in the 1920’s and 1930’s, Noel-Baker’s work was still focused   in and around the League of Nations. Few, if any, have done so   much to make the League of Nations known, and to get people to   understand its significance and to support it. In his excellent   little book The League of Nations at Work, published in   1926, he has provided a clear account of the idea behind the   League of Nations, its organization and its work, and what it had   achieved up to that time. He long sustained a hopeful faith in   the League’s importance for the future. He says: «It is fair   to hope, then, that in the institutions of the League there is a   sound foundation for whatever more complicated system of   international government the future may require.»9 But he does not ignore the possibility   that such hope may come to nothing: «But there is one doubt   about the future of the League which may give pause even to the   most hopeful of observers. It is this: Will its institutions be   given a real chance to build up their strength before the   catastrophe of a new world war sweeps them all away? Will the   forces of international cooperation and of mutual confidence   which the League is bringing into life be strong enough to hold   in check the forces of militarism, hatred, suspicion, and   revenge?»10    As we all know, the League of Nations was swept away by nazism   and Hitler. There are many today who have forgotten the work of   the League of Nations, and there are those who reproach the   League for failing to hold in check the storm that was brewing in   the 1930’s. This has made them pessimistic and has robbed them of   faith in the future. What’s the use? they ask.    Noel-Baker has refused to give way to pessimism and   despondency.    Although he was forced to watch so much that he had worked hard   for during most of his adult years crumble away before his eyes,   he has, since 1945, set out once again to do battle for the   selfsame ideals that the League of Nations represented.    In 1942 he had been made a member of Churchill’s government, and   in 1945 he served under Attlee11. He was named British representative   on the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations Organization.   With his wealth of experience from the League of Nations, he   exercised considerable influence on the form given to the   recommendations which laid the groundwork for the organization of   the United   Nations and its various sections and of the separate   organizations affiliated with it, such as the Food and Agriculture   Organization. He also promoted the establishment of the   International Refugee Organization (IRO), and submitted proposals   for setting up a separate economic commission for Europe12 – to mention some of his more   outstanding achievements.    During this period he acted as a member of the British   government, but there is no doubt that he was personally   responsible to a large extent for the wording and form of many of   the proposals, and he must be credited with the fact that they   were taken up by the British side.    His work as a member of the British government covers a great   deal more than this. It was Noel-Baker who directed negotiations   with India, Ireland, and Newfoundland, and it is widely accepted   that he was largely responsible for the successful issue of   negotiations with India, which probably constituted the most   important of these problems.    It would be impossible to go into all the international missions   Noel-Baker has had. Let me merely mention that he participated   actively in the work of the relief organization UNRRA13, and that he represented the United   Kingdom in work in the World Health Organization and in the UN Economic and   Social Council.    When Attlee’s government went out of office, Noel-Baker’s work as   a representative of his country’s government was at an end. But   as a member of the Labor «shadow cabinet» he has   played an important role, proving to be one of the leading   Opposition speakers on questions of foreign policy. We vividly   recall his speech during the debate on the Suez action of 1956,   which he strongly condemned, chiefly because the British   government had acted on its own without having recourse to the   United Nations14.    In 1958 appeared what I think we are justified in calling   Noel-Baker’s most important work, The Arms Race. In it he   deals with every aspect of the disarmament problem. With its   sound and expert reasoning and its carefully supported appraisals   of the difficulties to be encountered in any attempt to solve the   problem of disarmament, this book makes a profound impression. It   is impossible in a few words to give an adequate idea of this   work, of the author’s vivid description of the arms race and of   the arms of modern times, not only of those which go by the   common name of nuclear weapons, but also of chemical and   biological weapons.    He traces all the attempts that have been made to reach an   agreement on disarmament since the First World War and describes   the repeated efforts to find an effective system of control   acceptable to all parties. He shows how all these attempts failed   because of lack of trust and because no one was willing to accept   outside supervision within his own country.    While Noel-Baker is of the opinion that up to 1955 the Soviet   attitude was responsible for this failure, he is inclined to   think that the West has subsequently proved too adamant in its   demands. We should, he maintains, believe that the Soviet Union   today is in earnest when it states that it is prepared to   disarm.    Disarmament must be complete and must include all kinds of   weapons if it is to be effective. In his book Noel-Baker deals   with the possibilities that exist for carrying out effective   control, and makes a number of definite and concrete proposals,   not only for disarmament, but also for mutual control. Instead of   dismissing the objections that are made, he counters them with   pertinent facts. Above all he believes that we must accept the   risk that a control system may not prove to be completely   watertight, since this risk is a small one compared to that   involved in merely drifting aimlessly along as we are doing   today. Noel-Baker emphasizes the importance of developing any   system of collective security through the United Nations. Nowhere   in this book, or in explaining his views, does he fail to back up   his statements with well-founded facts.    Noel-Baker repeatedly emphasizes that the arms race in itself is   one of the main causes of war. If one country arms, the   confidence of other countries is undermined, and their feeling of   being in danger is increased. As a result, they, in their turn,   proceed to arm, for no government dare jeopardize its country’s   safety by failing to take the necessary precautions which are a   direct consequence of its neighbors’ arming to the teeth. In this   way the arms race is kept going in every country. Insofar as   possible, he uses statistics to show how the tempo of this race   has accelerated in recent years.    In view of the tremendous fund of experience he has gained from   working with these very problems in the interwar years, it would   be naive to believe that Noel-Baker is convinced that the problem   of disarmament is easily solved. The main point is that he   considers it within the realm of possibility.    As we all know, disarmament today depends primarily on whether   West and East can agree to a control system. Noel-Baker believes   that the possibility of this coming about is greater today than   at any time since 1945. His optimism has been strengthened by   conversations he had in 1958 in Moscow with Khrushchev and   Mikoyan15. From them he received   the impression that they are in earnest when they speak of   disarmament. But he says: «Their sincerity can only be   tested by offering them the detailed text of a controlled   disarmament system that would translate into reality the measures   which they say they will accept.»16    Some people have accused Noel-Baker of being too starry-eyed in   his attitude to the disarmament problem. To such critics he says:   «No one who has closely followed disarmament negotiations   since 1919 is likely to be guilty of facile optimism about the   prospect of success. But no one who understands the present arms   race should be guilty of facile pessimism, which is by far the   graver fault. Defeatism about the feasibility of plans for   disarmament and ordered peace has been the most calamitous of all   the errors made by democratic governments in modern   times.»17    There will always be pessimists among us, people filled with   misgivings.    These are seldom the people who improve the world. This can be   done only if hope and faith stimulate men to new attempts when   old attempts fail, and to new ways and means when old ways and   means do not succeed.    Philip Noel-Baker is a man cast in this mold. Throughout his life   he has been true to the high ideal of the Quakers – to help his   fellowmen, without regard to race or creed; he has striven to   build a world in which violence and arms are no longer necessary   in the struggle for existence, either among men or among   nations.    Throughout the years, despite disappointments and setbacks,   Philip John Noel-Baker has never admitted defeat, but has looked   steadfastly to the future, toward a new and better world.    1.

"36","1960","Albert Lutuli","   This year the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament has awarded two Peace Prizes. The prize for 1960 goes to Albert John Lutuli, and the prize for 1961 is awarded posthumously to Dag Hammarskjöld. In many respects these two recipients differ widely. Albert John Lutuli’s life and work have been molded by the pattern of the African tribal community and by the influence of Christianity, while Dag Hammarskjöld’s were a product of Western culture. Lutuli’s activities have been, and are, confined to his own country, while Dag Hammarskjöld worked in the international sphere. Yet despite these differences, they had one thing in common: both fought to implant the idea of justice in the individual, in the nation, and among the nations; or we might put it like this: they fought for the ideals expressed in the declaration of human rights embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. Albert John Lutuli was born in 1898. He comes from a long line of Zulu chiefs, but he was influenced by Christianity in his school days and in his later education, first in the American mission school he attended and afterwards during his training as a teacher. After passing his examination at Adams College in Natal, he became a faculty member of the college, where he taught, among other subjects, the history of the Zulu people. During his seventeen years as a teacher, he took no part in the political life of South Africa. In 1935 a great change took place in Lutuli’s life when he was called to assume the functions of tribal chief. The choice of a chief must be approved by the state, which pays his salary. It was on the basis of this authority that the government was able to remove him in 1952. His seventeen years as a chief brought him daily contact with the individual members of the tribal community, as well as an active part in the work of the Christian church in South Africa, in India, and in the United States. Both as a teacher and later as a chief, Lutuli did outstanding work. He took his duties as chief very seriously and in doing so won the affection of his tribe. He endeavored to blend its ancient culture with the precepts of Christianity and to promote its economic welfare in various ways – for example, by introducing new methods of sugar production. Describing this period of his life, he tells us: “Previous to being a chief I was a school teacher for about seventeen years. In these past thirty years or so, I have striven with tremendous zeal and patience to work for the progress and welfare of my people and for their harmonious relations with other sections of our multiracial society in the Union of South Africa. In this effort I always pursued the path of moderation. Over this great length of time I have, year after year, gladly spent hours of my time with such organizations as the church and its various agencies, such as the Christian Council of South Africa, the Joint Council of Europeans and Africans, and the now defunct Native Representative Council.”1 But it was neither as a teacher, nor as a chief, nor as an active member of various Christian organizations that he took a focal position in what was to be his great effort in the post war years. The forces that induced Albert John Lutuli to abandon his tranquil educational activities and enter politics were unleashed by the increasing pressure which the ruling white race exerted on members of other races in South Africa. In 1944 he became a member of the African National Congress, an organization founded in 1912. In 1952 he was elected its president, an office he held until the Congress was banned in 1960. It is first and foremost for the work he carried on during these years – from the 1940s to the present – that we honor him today. To get some idea of Lutuli’s achievements, we must know something of the society in which he worked. The white population of South Africa settled there in the latter half of the seventeenth century. The first settlers were French Huguenots, followed later by Dutch farmers. They cleared the land, and their descendants – the Boers – have lived there ever since. They look upon the country as their fatherland; they have no other. The English settlers, who arrived on the scene at the end of the eighteenth century, maintained close contact with their mother country. The first natives whom the Dutch pioneers met were Hottentots and Bushmen. The Hottentots have now virtually disappeared as a separate racial entity; but through intermarriage with European and other races they have contributed in large measure to the racial characteristics of those so-called “the colored people”. When the Boers moved into the interior, they encountered other native tribes, among them the Zulus, whom they fought and conquered. These tribes constitute the largest part of the population of South Africa today. In the course of time other racial elements were added: the Dutch imported a number of Malays from the East Indies as slaves, while the British introduced Indian labor to the sugar plantations. In the nineteenth century two communities took shape: the Boer republics of Transvaal2 and the Orange Free State, and the British colony of South Africa, both ruled by whites. At the turn of the century these two communities fought the Boer War of 1899-1902, from which Britain finally emerged victorious. The ultimate result was that the Union of South Africa was set up as an independent British Dominion in 1901. At that time the outside world heard little about relations between whites and nonwhites. During the fifty years that have since elapsed, South Africa, in common with so many other countries, has developed from an agricultural community into one in which mining, industry, trade, and other such operations now predominate. As in other such countries, the urban population has increased rapidly. The present-day population of South Africa is some 14.7 million, of whom only some 3.3 million are white. Of the remainder, 9.6 million are Africans, some 0.4 million Asian (mainly Indians) and 1.4 million of mixed race (the so-called colored people). Of the 9.6 million Africans, some 3.3 million live in the agricultural districts of the whites, a large proportion of them as agricultural workers on white farms; 3.7 million live in the African reservations; and 2.6 million live in the towns. Although some of these figures are only approximate, they still present a picture of a community whose economy and therefore future are dependent on cooperation between all races. The figures testify to the fact that people of all races have helped to build this community. The whites could never have done it alone. This is an incontestable fact. But what is the position of the nonwhite population? In this community, nonwhites are denied all right to participate in the government of the state. They are discriminated against legally, economically, and socially. And this discrimination between whites and nonwhites has grown steadily during the postwar years. The aim of those now ruling the country is to draw a line between the two communities – between whites and nonwhites – despite the fact that the march of events has clearly shown that the whole community has been developed by the efforts of all races. I cannot here go into the network of laws and regulations passed in order to maintain the barrier between whites and nonwhites. The purpose of these laws is to restrict and regulate every facet of the life of the nonwhite. He has no vote, he has no part in determining his own status; under the pass system, he is deprived not only of the right to live where he likes but also of the right to choose his employer; he has virtually no redress against police tyranny; he is not entitled to the same schooling or education as the white; and any sexual relation between white and nonwhite entails punishment for both parties. An African Christian is frequently not allowed to worship God under the same roof as a white Christian. In short, nonwhites are treated as a subject race. Is it surprising then that the nonwhites have protested against such treatment? What is surprising is that the protest has not been accompanied by acts of violence on their part. Their patience is remarkable, their moral strength in the struggle boundless. It was the discrimination between white and nonwhite that prompted nonwhite Africans in 1912 to establish the African National Congress. Its founders were nonwhite Africans who had obtained a higher education, either abroad or at home, in the days when they still had the opportunity to do so. At first the African National Congress tried to influence political development by means of petitions and deputations to the authorities, but when the attempt proved fruitless and new laws restricting the rights of nonwhites were passed, the African National Congress adopted a more active line, especially after 1949. It was in the mid-1940s that Lutuli began to participate in this work of the African National Congress, of which he became a member in 1944. He was elected to the Committee of the Natal Section in 1945 and in 1951 became president of the Natal Section. In December, 1952, he was elected president of the entire African National Congress, a position he retained until the organization was banned by the government in 1960. It was during these transitional years of adopting stronger action, based on boycotts, defiance campaigns, and strikes, that Lutuli came to influence so profoundly the African National Congress. He says himself that the Congress never passed any specific resolution to the effect that its struggle was to be pursued by nonviolent means. Actually, however, it has been waged with peaceful means, a policy at all times supported by the Congress administration. Lutuli himself has always been categorically opposed to the use of violence. Within the organization he has had to overcome opposition from two different quarters: from the older members, who supported the more passive approach, and from those members – mainly the younger ones – who wanted to make South Africa an entirely nonwhite state. As a result of Lutuli’s participation in the more active struggle of the African National Congress, the government presented him with an ultimatum: he must either renounce his position as a chief or give up his seat in the Congress. He refused to comply with either of these alternatives and was immediately deposed as chief, whereupon he issued his significant declaration entitled “The Chief Speaks”, which concludes with the words: “The Road to Freedom is via the Cross.” In his declaration, he says: “What have been the fruits of my many years of moderation? Has there been any reciprocal tolerance or moderation from the Government, be it Nationalist or United Party? No! On the contrary, the past thirty years have seen the greatest number of Laws restricting our rights and progress until today we have reached a stage where we have almost no rights at all: no adequate land for our occupation, our only asset, cattle, dwindling, no security of homes, no decent and remunerative employment, more restrictions to freedom of movement through passes, curfew regulations, influx control measures; in short, we have witnessed in these years an intensification of our subjection to ensure and protect white supremacy. It is with this background and with a full sense of responsibility that, under the auspices of the African National Congress (Natal), I have joined my people in the new spirit that moves them today, the spirit that revolts openly and boldly against injustice and expresses itself in a determined and nonviolent manner… The African National Congress, its nonviolent Passive Resistance Campaign, may be of nuisance value to the Government, but it is not subversive since it does not seek to overthrow the form and machinery of the State but only urges for the inclusion of all sections of the community in a partnership in the Government of the country on the basis of equality. Laws and conditions that tend to debase human personality – a God-given force – be they brought about by the State or other individuals, must be relentlessly opposed in the spirit of defiance shown by St. Peter when he said to the rulers of his day: Shall we obey God or man? No one can deny that insofar as nonwhites are concerned in the Union of South Africa, laws and conditions that debase human personality abound. Any chief worthy of his position must fight fearlessly against such debasing conditions and laws… It is inevitable that in working for Freedom some individuals and some families must take the lead and suffer: the Road to Freedom Is via the Cross.” In 1952, after he had been dismissed from his position as chief and had been elected president of the African National Congress, he was forbidden to leave his home district for two years.3 In 1954 he went to Johannesburg to address a meeting which had been called to protest the forced evacuation of colored people from Sophiatown to Meadowsland. He was refused permission to speak and was banned for another period of two years from leaving his home district. In 1956, together with 155 other persons, he was arrested and charged with high treason. In 1957 the charge against him and sixty-four others was withdrawn; the rest were all acquitted in 1961. In 1959 Lutuli took part in several mass meetings, but was again subjected to a travel ban, this time for a period of five years. In 1960 there was a large mass demonstration against the pass regulations which led to the events in Sharpeville, where police fired on the crowd, killing and wounding many. A state of emergency was declared and wholesale arrests were made. Lutuli, who had been summoned as a witness in the treason trial, which had dragged on ever since 1956, was among those arrested but was allowed to give evidence in the trial. During the last year, he has lived at home, debarred from leaving his village and from taking part in any meetings. Moreover, he is now no longer president of the African National Congress, for this organization – as already mentioned – was dissolved by order of the government in April, 1960. He now lives in his village, deprived of freedom of movement and of the right to speak in open debate, but he still maintains his avowed policy, expressing his views in articles published in the newspaper Post.4 Just before the travel ban was imposed on him in December, 1919 – the year before the Union of South Africa was to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its foundation – he wrote a long article entitled “Fifty Years of Union – A Political Review,” which he sent to the South Africa Institute of Race Relations.5 This presents, as far as I know, the clearest and the most complete statement of his position concerning the policy pursued by the government of South Africa. In this article, his attack on the policies of the South African government is stronger and more detailed than before. This discussion and attack on the policy of apartheid and its plan that the nonwhite community should develop along its own lines is new. He asks: Who has drawn the lines? The answer is: Not those who are to follow them, the nonwhites, but the whites in power. The nonwhites have no rights. There is therefore no reason, he says, for them to rejoice or to participate in the Fiftieth Anniversary celebration. The only thing for the nonwhites to do is to work, each and everyone, with courage and patience, to achieve freedom and democracy for all. Since he wrote this, South Africa has become a republic and is no longer a member of the British Commonwealth. But this has not improved relations between whites and nonwhites, nor has it altered Lutuli’s attitude in any way. He gives a most concise expression of the view he has always maintained in a letter to Prime Minister Striddom6, in which he says: “We believe in a community where the white and the nonwhite in South Africa can live in harmony and work for our common fatherland, sharing equally the good things of life which our country can give us in abundance. We believe in the brotherhood of peoples and in respect for the value of the individual. My congress has never given expression to hatred for any race in South Africa.” Time and again he has reiterated this, right up to the very present. His activity has been characterized by a firm and unswerving approach. Never has he succumbed to the temptation to use violent means in the struggle for his people. Nothing has shaken him from this firm resolve, so firmly rooted is his conviction that violence and terror must not be employed. Nor has he ever felt or incited hatred of the white man. Albert John Lutuli’s fight has been waged within the borders of his own country; but the issues raised go far beyond them. He brings a message to all who work and strive to establish respect for human rights both within nations and between nations. Well might we ask: will the nonwhites of South Africa, by their suffering, their humiliation, and their patience, show the other nations of the world that human rights can be won without violence, by following a road to which we Europeans are committed both intellectually and emotionally, but which we have all too often abandoned? If the nonwhite people of South Africa ever lift themselves from their humiliation without resorting to violence and terror, then it will be above all because of the work of Lutuli, their fearless and incorruptible leader who, thanks to his own high ethical standards, has rallied his people in support of this policy, and who throughout his adult life has staked everything and suffered everything without bitterness and without allowing hatred and aggression to replace his abiding love of his fellowmen. But if the day should come when the struggle of the nonwhites in South Africa to win their freedom degenerates into bloody slaughter, then Lutuli’s voice will be heard no more. But let us remember him then and never forget that his way was unwavering and clear. He would not have had it so. Let us all rise in silent and respectful tribute to Albert John Lutuli. 1.

"37","1961","Dag Hammarskjöld"," The Nobel   Committee of the Norwegian Parliament has awarded the Peace   Prize for 1961 posthumously to Dag Hammarskjöld.    Dag Hammarskjöld was born in 1905, and prior to his   appointment as Secretary-General to the Secretariat of the   United Nations   in 1953, he had been associated with the administration of his   native Sweden ever since the completion of his education.    He had studied widely, and his knowledge ranged far beyond his   chosen field. His special subject, however, was regarded as   economics, in which he took his doctor’s degree in 1934, with a   thesis entitled “Konjunkturspridningen.”1 He had by then already obtained   degrees in philology and in law. In 1936 he entered the Swedish   Ministry of Finance, and from 1941 to 1948, he was chairman of   the Board of the Swedish Riksbank. In 1945 he became government   adviser on trade policy and financial policy and in 1947 joined   the Swedish Foreign Office. In 1951 he was appointed a   consultative cabinet minister. But as he himself pointed out, he   was committed to no particular party, and his cabinet appointment   was a professional rather than a political one. In addition to   leading various Swedish financial delegations in negotiations   with other countries – primarily in connection with trade   agreements – he also represented Sweden in UNISCAN2 negotiations and was for a time   vice-chairman of OEEC.3    A brief recapitulation of this kind tells us little about Dag   Hammarskjöld the man; nor does his well-merited reputation   as a person of outstanding intellectual ability shed much light   on his personality. So many men receive this tribute. Those of us   who knew him before he became the Secretary General were also   impressed by this young man’s wide knowledge and   indefatigability, as well as by his quiet and unassuming approach   to his administrative duties in the service of his country.    In 1953 he assumed his post as Secretary-General in the United   Nations Secretariat. He had already come into contact with the   United Nations as a member and vice-chairman of the Swedish   delegation to the General Assembly in 1951 and as chairman of the   delegation in 1952. As Secretary-General he succeeded Mr. Trygve   Lie,4 who had not only built up   the United Nations administration and participated in planning   its new building, but had also given the post of   secretary-general a more important and independent position   within the United Nations than had probably been originally   envisaged. In other words, he took over an office which had   already been given form and an administrative apparatus which had   acquired a certain amount of tradition.    There is no doubt that in accepting this high office Dag   Hammarskjöld fully realized that the years ahead would not   prove easy. He was all too familiar with the difficulties Trygve   Lie had encountered to have any illusions on that score. Fully   aware of the magnitude and complexity of his task, he devoted   himself to it completely, exerting all his determination and   strength in carrying it out. In a private letter written in 1953   he says: “To know that the goal is so significant that everything   else must be set aside gives a great sense of liberation and   makes one indifferent to anything that may happen to   oneself.”    It has often been said that from the very first he wished to play   the role of adviser rather than that of politician, or we might   say that he preferred to be the one carrying out what others had   decided rather than the one who made the decision.    As far as I can judge, this appraisal is not correct. From the   beginning, back in 1953, when he outlined the role and activities   of the Secretariat and the secretary-general, he laid down that,   while it is clearly the duty of the Secretariat and of the   Secretary-General to obtain complete and objective information on   the aims and problems of the various member nations, the   secretary-general must personally form an opinion; he must base   it on the rules of the UN   Charter and must never for a moment betray those rules, even   if this means being at variance with members of the UN.    From the very first he placed great importance on the solution of   disputes through the medium of private discussion between   representatives of the individual countries, pursuing what has   come to be known as the “method of quiet diplomacy.” There is, of   course, nothing new in this, as informal meetings of this kind   have always been and will always be an important part of the work   necessary to achieve agreement between conflicting views.    Outwardly it may have looked as if he became more and more active   as time went on, but this, I believe, can be ascribed more to the   course of events than to any change in his views. In every   situation with which he was faced he had one goal in mind: to   serve the ideas sponsored by the United Nations. He called   himself an international civil servant, with the emphasis on the   word “international.”5 As such he   had only one master, and that was the United Nations.    There can be little doubt that Dag Hammarskjöld achieved a   great deal through the informal meetings he took part in, and   that in these he demonstrated strong personal initiative; yet his   personal contribution was best known to the general public in   cases where attempts to reach agreement between members in the   United Nations had failed, or where the instructions he had   received were not sufficiently clear, and he was compelled   personally to point the way, as we shall see. It is impossible to   mention in detail the many areas in which he intervened and on   which he left his mark during the time he was   Secretary-General.    The first and most important disputes which fell to his lot to   settle arose in the Middle East. The first of these was the   conflict between Israel and the Arab States in 1955. As the   representative of the UN, he succeeded in easing the tension by   negotiating an agreement between each of the parties involved and   the UN, setting up demarcation lines and establishing UN   observation posts. Personally he did not believe that the   relaxation of tension would prove permanent, and he was right in   his surmise.    In the following year, in September of 1956, the conflict that   arose between Great Britain, France, and Egypt, after Egypt had   nationalized the Suez Canal, was submitted to the Security   Council. In October, 1956, Dag Hammarskjöld tried to find a   solution to this dispute through private negotiations conducted   by himself, and it looked as if these would lead to a   satisfactory result. But at the end of October, 1956, Israel   attacked Egypt, and on October 30 the Security Council was called   together to deal with the situation that had arisen. This   meeting, however, proved abortive when France and Great Britain   exercised their veto right to obstruct a resolution calling on   Israel to withdraw her troops. On the next day, October 31,   France and Great Britain launched their attack on Egypt. At the   meeting of the Security Council on October 31, Hammarskjöld   was the first person to speak. In a forthright speech he hinted   that he would resign unless all member states honored their   pledge to abide by all clauses of the Charter.    On October 31 the General Assembly was then convoked, and on   November 1 passed a resolution calling on the parties concerned   to terminate hostilities immediately and requesting the   Secretary-General to keep a close watch on the course of events   and to report on the way in which the resolution was being   implemented. In reality the Secretary-General was thus vested   with far-reaching powers. On November 3 Hammarskjöld was   already able to announce that France and Great Britain were   willing to suspend hostilities, provided that Israel and Egypt   were prepared to accept the establishment of a UN force to ensure   and supervise the suspension of hostilities and subsequently to   prevent the violation of the Egyptian-Israeli border. The result   was that the war was brought to an end, a demarcation line was   fixed, and a UN force was established to guard it.    He also made a major contribution to the solution of a crisis   between Lebanon, Jordan, and the Arab States in 1958. In this,   both the United States and Great Britain were involved.    During these crises, all his qualities were given full scope,   particularly his ability to negotiate and to act swiftly and   firmly; and to Dag Hammarskjöld must go the principal credit   for the fact that all these crises were resolved in the spirit of   the United Nations. A state of peace was established in this   area.6 This was a triumph for the   ideal of peace of which the UN is an expression, and in addition   undoubtedly greatly strengthened the position of the   Secretary-General.    The concept of peace contained in the UN Charter was always to   remain Dag Hammarskjöld’s guiding principle in tackling such   problems as that presented by the liberation of the Congo on June   30, 1960.    There is no time to deal here with all the problems confronting   the United Nations in connection with the termination of colonial   rule. I must restrict myself to the role which the United Nations   was to play in the Congo. When the Congo achieved its   independence on June 30, 1960, it was constituted as a unified   state. Kasavubu7 was elected   president and Lumumba8 was made   prime minister. Lumumba had always supported the idea of a   unified Congo.    The new government was faced with a difficult situation: the   administration, which had been in Belgian hands, had broken down;   the army had mutinied; a large proportion of the white population   had fled; Belgian troops had intervened – in part to protect the   white inhabitants; and on July 1, the province of Katanga   declared itself an independent state.    All these factors – the collapse of the administration, the   mutiny of the armed forces, and finally Katanga’s secession from   the rest of the Congo form the background for the request made to   the UN by Kasavubu and Lumumba on July 1 for civil assistance and   on July 12 for military aid. In a cable dispatched on July 13,   Lumumba emphasized that UN military assistance was needed to   protect the Congo against an attack by Belgian troops.    Hammarskjöld was in a position to grant the Congo’s request   for civil aid without referring the case to the Security Council;   military aid, however, could be given only by decision of the   Security Council, which he summoned on July 13.    This meeting is highly important, for it marks a turning point in   the history of the UN. It was the first time that the UN used   armed force to intervene actively in the solution of a problem   involving the termination of colonial rule. In the resolution   unanimously adopted by the Security Council, Belgium was ordered   to withdraw her troops from Congo territory, and the   Secretary-General was authorized in consultation with the Congo   government to provide whatever military aid proved necessary   until such time as the country’s own forces were, in the opinion   of the Congo government, in a position to carry out their   functions.    The military aid made available to the Congo consisted of   contingents from African nations and from neutral Sweden and   Ireland. No troops from the Eastern bloc or from the old colonial   powers were included. The UN force was to function as a   noncombatant peace force; there was to be no intervention in   disputes involving matters of internal policy, and arms were to   be used only in self-defense.    This form of military aid did not meet the expectations of the   Congo government, which had clearly envisaged the expulsion of   Belgian troops by UN forces; whereas the UN’s action was taken on   the assumption that Belgium would comply with the order of the   Security Council and withdraw her troops from the Congo.    This Belgium failed to do, despite the fact that a note of July   14 addressed to the Congo government announced that Belgian   troops would be withdrawn to two bases in Katanga as soon as UN   forces had succeeded in establishing law and order.    Thus, during these first few days, UN intervention had not   brought about the result Lumumba had anticipated. The Belgian   troops remained in their bases in Katanga, and fresh Belgian   troops were dispatched to the Congo.    As a consequence, during the period from July 14 to July 20,   1960, Lumumba made some highly unexpected moves. First of all, as   early as July 14 he sent a cable to Khrushchev,9 announcing the possibility of asking   for Russian aid if the Western powers continued their aggression   against the Congo. On July 15 he had already received an   encouraging reply from Khrushchev.    With that, the Congo crisis became a factor in the East-West   conflict, rendering the position of Hammarskjöld and the UN   in the Congo immensely difficult.    As the days and months went by, their position became no easier.   All conceivable obstacles to the success of the UN’s Congo   venture seemed to pile up: disagreement among the Congolese   themselves on the question of unified state or confederation, the   support Katanga received from Belgium, Soviet aid to Lumumba, the   dissolution of the central government, the military rule under   Mobutu, the murder of Lumumba, increasingly violent Russian   attacks on Hammarskjöld and UN action. A complete account of   all that occurred cannot be given here; but an examination of the   available documents covering this period will establish that it   was the United Nations alone that worked to realize the   establishment of the Republic of the Congo as an independent   nation, and that the man who above all others deserves the credit   for this is Dag Hammarskjöld.    Time and again, in the Security Council and in the meetings of   the General Assembly, he fought in defense of his policy and   carried the day. He insisted throughout that all aid to the Congo   civil as well as military – must be made available through the   medium of the UN. No vested interests representing any of the   power blocs must be allowed to exert their influence. Is it then   surprising that he was the object of attack, at times from the   West but most often and most violently from the Soviet Union,   whose charges took the form of an assault on the very idea of the   United Nations Organization as a separate power? In the calm and   dignified answer which Dag Hammarskjöld made to the Soviet   leaders, he said that he would remain at his post as long as this   was necessary to defend and strengthen the authority of the   United Nations. And he added: It is not Soviet Russia or any of   the great powers that need the vigilance and protection of the   UN; it is all the others.10    But he was not destined to live long enough to pursue his policy   to its conclusion.    We all know that he perished on his way to a meeting which he   hoped would bring an end to the fighting in the Congo between   Katanga troops and UN forces, which had just broken out during   the attempt to implement the UN resolution of February 21, 1961.   This resolution called on UN military forces to take immediate   steps to prevent a civil war in the Congo, and to use force only   as a last resort. The UN was furthermore enjoined to ensure that   all Belgian and other foreign military, political, and other   advisers not under UN command should be withdrawn   immediately.    Hammarskjöld left for the Congo on September 12, at the   invitation of the Congolese government, to discuss the range and   details of the UN’s program of aid to the Congo. When Dag   Hammarskjöld left New York, he knew that the situation in   Katanga was difficult, but it was not until he received Dr.   Linner’s report on September 14 that he learned that Katanga   forces and UN troops were fighting one another.11    Attempts to conclude a truce during the first few days of his   visit proved unsuccessful; so Dag Hammarskjöld decided to   establish personal contact with the President of Katanga,   Tshombe;12 his purpose, as he   explained in a message to Tshombe, was to find the means of   settling the immediate conflict in a peaceful manner and thus   open the way to a solution of the Katanga problem within the   framework of the Congolese state.    The meeting never took place. Dag Hammarskjöld’s plane   crashed on September 18 on its way to Tshombe. He and all the   others aboard perished.    Then – and not till then – criticism of Hammarskjöld and UN   policy in the Congo was silenced, but during the period from   September 13 to 18, operations in the province of Katanga were   severely criticized, this time in Western quarters, with the   strongest assault coming from certain English Conservative   newspapers.    Dag Hammarskjöld was exposed to criticism and violent,   unrestrained attacks, but he never departed from the path he had   chosen from the very first: the path that was to result in the   UN’s developing into an effective and constructive international   organization, capable of giving life to the principles and aims   expressed in the UN Charter, administered by a strong Secretariat   served by men who both felt and acted internationally. The goal   he always strove to attain was to make the UN Charter the one by   which all countries regulated themselves.    Today this goal may seem remote; as we know, it is remote. Dag   Hammarskjöld fully realized this, and in a speech in Chicago   in 1960 he said:    “Working at the edge of the development of human society is to   work on the brink of the unknown. Much of what is done will one   day prove to have been of little avail. That is no excuse for the   failure to act in accordance with our best understanding, in   recognition of its limits but with faith in the ultimate result   of the creative evolution in which it is our privilege to   cooperate.”13    His driving force was his belief that goodwill among men and   nations would one day create conditions in which peace would   prevail in the world.    The Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament has today awarded   him the Peace Prize for 1961 posthumously in gratitude for all he   did, for what he achieved, for what he fought for: to create   peace and goodwill among nations and men.

"38","1962","Linus Pauling"," Shortly after the atomic bombs were   exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki1, Albert Einstein made   this statement:    “The time has come now, when man must give up war. It is no   longer rational to solve international problems by resorting to   war. Now that an atomic bomb, such as the bombs exploded at   Hiroshima and Nagasaki, can destroy a city, kill all the people   in a city, a small city the size of Minneapolis, say, we can see   that we must now make use of man’s powers of reason, in order to   settle disputes between nations.                In accordance with the principles of justice we must develop international                law, strengthen the United                Nations, and have peace in the world from now on.”    At the time few people heeded these words of Albert   Einstein.    One man, however, never forgot them, the man we welcome among us   today, the man whom the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian   Parliament has selected for this year’s award of the Peace Prize   – Linus Carl Pauling, who ever since 1946 has campaigned   ceaselessly, not only against nuclear weapons tests, not only   against the spread of these armaments, not only against their   very use, but against all warfare as a means of solving   international conflicts.                Linus Pauling is a professor of chemistry; for thirty-nine years                he has been on the staff of the California Institute of Technology                in Pasadena, where he was made a professor in 1931. In addition                to the Nobel Prize                in Chemistry, his scientific achievements have won him many                distinctions, medals, and honors, both in his own country and abroad.                His renown as a scientist is beyond dispute.    In 1946, at the request of Albert Einstein, Linus Pauling,   together with seven other scientists, formed the Emergency   Committee of Atomic Scientists, of which Einstein was   chairman.1 The most important   task of this committee was to bring to the notice of people   everywhere the tremendous change that had taken place in the   world after the splitting of the atom and the production of the   atomic bomb had become fact. In the words of the author Robert   Jungk, “it was a crusade undertaken by men who were children in   political affairs.”2    The hope cherished by mankind that, once the Second World War was   over, an age of peace and disarmament would follow, was not   fulfilled. It was not long before differences between East and   West emerged in all their stark reality, as the cooperation   engendered in time of war crumbled and was replaced by suspicion   and mutual fear of aggression.    The result was the armaments race between the two great powers,   to see who could produce the most effective nuclear weapons.   Gradually the “terror balance” became the tacitly accepted   safeguard against war and a guarantee of peace.    It was in August, 1949, that the Soviet Union also succeeded in   producing the atom bomb.3    The armaments race created an atmosphere which not only made it   difficult to work for the promotion of disarmament and peace but   also threatened to muzzle freedom of speech.    Inevitably, the crusade lost impetus and faded away.    But Linus Pauling marched on; for him, retreat was   impossible.    During the first few years, his aim was above all to prevent the   hydrogen bomb from becoming a reality. In speeches and lectures   he endeavored to open the eyes of his fellowmen to the   catastrophe it represented. “This bomb”, he declared, “may have a   destructive effect, a hundred, a thousand, nay ten thousand times   greater than that of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Its effect will depend on how great the bomb is and at what   height above the earth it is exploded.” This statement was made   as early as 1947, and subsequent tests with the hydrogen bomb   proved the validity of his predictions.    On February 13, 1950, Pauling spoke to a large audience in   Carnegie Hall in New York, this time in protest against the   decision to produce the hydrogen bomb. His speech was   subsequently published as a brochure entitled The Ultimate   Decision.    He opened his speech by describing the consequences, should there   be a major war involving hydrogen bombs: a thousand million men   and women dead, and the earth’s atmosphere permeated with toxic   radioactive substances, from which no human being, animal, or   plant would be safe.    He concludes as follows:    “The solution of the world’s problem – the problem of atomic war   – is that we must – we must bring law and order into the world as   a whole…    Our political leaders impelled by the massed feelings of the   people of the world must learn that peace is the important goal –   a peace that reflects the spirit of true humanity, the spirit of   the brotherhood of man.    It is not necessary that the social and economic systems in   Russia be identical with that in the United States, in order that   these two great nations can be at peace with one another. It is   only necessary that the people of the United States and the   people of Russia have respect for one another, a deep desire to   work for progress, a mutual recognition that war has finally   ruled itself out as the arbiter of the destiny of humanity. Once   the people of the world express these feelings, the East and the   West can reach a reasonable and equitable decision about all   world affairs and can march together side by side, towards a more   and more glorious future.”    This 1950 speech was followed by a series of talks and lectures   on the same subject – what would happen if a major nuclear war   broke out.    There were many, of course, who recognized the truth of Linus   Pauling’s warning, but at that time his words aroused no general   response from the American public. Outside the ranks of   scientists and peace organizations, he was then relatively   unknown. And the people themselves? In the United States – as   here in Norway at a later period – they found it most convenient   to turn a deaf ear to his warnings.    The United States tested its first hydrogen bomb in November,   1952, and the Soviet Union followed suit in August, 1953. The   cold war had now entered upon a still more uncompromising phase,   but the voice of Linus Pauling was not to be silenced. Tireless   and undaunted, and supported in his views by numerous scientists,   he continued to draw attention to the fearful destruction and   mass annihilation of human life that might result if hydrogen   bombs were used. “There does not seem,” he says, “to be any   theoretical limit to the size of these weapons.”    Of the appeals launched at this time bearing Pauling’s signature,   the Mainau Declaration of July 15, 1955, is the best known. It   was signed by fifty-two Nobel Prizewinners, most of them   scientists. The appeal is such an important document that I   should like to quote it:    “We, the undersigned, are scientists of different countries,   different creeds, different political persuasions. Outwardly, we   are bound together only by the Nobel Prize, which we have been   favored to receive. With pleasure we have devoted our lives to   the service of science. It is, we believe, a path to a happier   life for people. We see with horror that this very science is   giving mankind the means to destroy itself. By total military use   of weapons feasible today, the earth can be contaminated with   radioactivity to such an extent that whole peoples can be   annihilated. Neutrals may die thus as well as belligerents.    If war broke out among the great powers, who could guarantee that   it would not develop into a deadly conflict? A nation that   engages in a total war thus signals its own destruction and   imperils the whole world.    We do not deny that perhaps peace is being preserved precisely by   the fear of these weapons. Nevertheless, we think it is a   delusion if governments believe that they can avoid war for a   long time through the fear of these weapons. Fear and tension   have often engendered wars. Similarly it seems to us a delusion   to believe that small conflicts could in the future always be   decided by traditional weapons. In extreme danger no nation will   deny itself the use of any weapon that scientific technology can   produce.    All nations must come to the decision to renounce force as a   final resort. If they are not prepared to do this, they will   cease to exist.”    In the harsh political atmosphere then prevailing, it was not   surprising that Linus Pauling gradually became isolated and   ostracized, primarily on suspicion of being a Communist.    On several occasions during the 1950s, the authorities withheld   his passport, even when he wished to travel abroad to attend   conferences of a purely scientific nature, as for example in   1952. It is only fair to record that, upon making his application   direct to Washington, he was granted his passport.    In 1955 Dr. Pauling appeared before a committee of the United   States Senate that was investigating the work of the Passport   Office. He was then questioned on his alleged associations with   Communists or Communist sympathizers, a term which at that time   was applied to many people. When asked whether he himself was a   Communist, Linus Pauling repeated what he had so often declared   under oath: that he was not a Communist, that he had not been a   Communist, that he was not a crypto-Communist nor a theoretical   Marxist, that he had never wittingly helped the Communist Party   or followed the party line. The senator conducting the   investigation remarked that it was his own impression that “it   was the Communists who had followed Pauling’s line.” This was as   far as the committee could get, and for a few years Pauling was   left in peace.    Anyone familiar with Linus Pauling and his views, anyone who has   heard him speak or has read his works, should know that he is by   no means a Communist.    Meanwhile, as the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet   Union stepped up their nuclear tests, radioactive fallout in the   earth’s atmosphere increased.    Soon more and more scientists, alive to the dangerous effects of   radioactive fallout on human health and hereditary factors, were   protesting against these tests.    Linus Pauling was one of the first to perceive the danger, and   from the middle of the 1950s he devoted the better part of his   time and energy to his campaign against test explosions. He   constantly maintained that these tests must be terminated by an   agreement signed by the countries possessing the atomic bomb and   the hydrogen bomb, and that the agreement must be enforced by   means of effective international supervision.    It was during his struggle to end tests of nuclear weapons that   Linus Pauling’s name became well known all over the world – and   also controversial.    In order to assess in terms of figures the effect radioactive   fallout would have on future generations, Linus Pauling carried   out his own investigations and calculations, calculations which   he always submits with reservation, because of the many unknown   factors involved.    Time and again he states: “Maybe my figures are many times too   high, maybe they are many times too low.” But his calculations   were supported by many others. I need only remind you of Albert Schweitzer’s message broadcast by   the Oslo radio station on April 23, 1957.    The opposition Pauling encountered came first of all from two   scientists, E. Teller3 and   W.F. Libby ,   of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.    They seem to differ not so much on the resultant calculations   themselves as on the conclusion to be drawn from these   calculations.    Teller and Libby readily admit that radioactive fallout is   harmful, but they consider this fact relative, weighing it   against the risk taken by being unable to secure ever more   effective defensive armaments through nuclear tests.    Pauling’s views on test explosions, on the other hand, are not   dependent on whether there are few or many people who would   suffer from radioactive fallout.                On May 15, 1957, in a speech to students at Washington University                in St. Louis, he dealt with what was known about the effect of radioactivity                on human hereditary factors. Among other things, he said: “I believe                that no human being should be sacrificed to a project; and in particular                I believe that no human being should be sacrificed to the project                of perfecting nuclear weapons that could kill hundreds of millions                of human beings, could devastate this beautiful world in which we                live.”    It was after this speech that he drew up the appeal which, more   than anything else, attracted the attention of the public. This   appeal was signed by more than 2,000 American scientists and was   later circulated and signed by over 8,000 foreign scientists,   from forty-nine different countries.    In his book No More War!, published in 1958, Linus Pauling   has described how he collected these signatures.    The petition was the result of the efforts of individual   scientists. No organization was responsible for circulating the   petition or gathering signatures. The whole job was done by a   mere handful of people.                In January, 1958, Linus Pauling and his wife, Ava Helen Pauling,                submitted the appeal, with its 11,021 signatures, to the Secretary-General                of the United Nations Organization, Dag Hammarskjöld. The Pauling Appeal reads as                follows:    “We, the scientists whose names are signed below, urge that an   international agreement to stop the testing of nuclear bombs be   made now.    Each nuclear bomb test spreads an added burden of radioactive   elements over every part of the world. Each added amount of   radiation causes damage to the health of human beings all over   the world and causes damage to the pool of human germ plasma such   as to lead to an increase in the number of seriously defective   children that will be born in future generations.    So long as these weapons are in the hands of only three powers,   an agreement for their control is feasible. If testing continues,   and the possession of these weapons spreads to additional   governments, the danger of outbreak of a cataclysmic nuclear war   through the reckless action of some irresponsible national leader   will be greatly increased.    An international agreement to stop the testing of nuclear bombs   now could serve as a first step toward a more general disarmament   and the ultimate effective abolition of nuclear weapons, averting   the possibility of a nuclear war that would be a catastrophe to   all humanity.    We have in common with our fellowmen a deep concern for the   welfare of all human beings. As scientists we have knowledge of   the dangers involved and therefore a special responsibility to   make those dangers known. We deem it imperative that immediate   action be taken to effect an international agreement to stop the   testing of all nuclear weapons.”    And then, in 1958, without entering into any prior agreement, the   Soviet Union, followed by the United States and Great Britain,   discontinued nuclear tests.    Just what effect the warnings of scientists – foremost among them   Linus Pauling and Albert Schweitzer – may have had in this   connection, would be difficult to say with any certainty. But   there is no doubt that both of them, together with other   scientists, have contributed to familiarizing people with the   dangers nuclear tests involve; and every government is bound to   take into consideration public opinion, whether openly expressed   or not.    Pauling’s campaign had aroused a tremendous amount of attention   both at home and abroad.    Once again the Internal Security Subcommittee of the United   States Senate summoned him for interrogation. The first interview   took place on June 21, 1960, and the second on October 11 of the   same year.    At Pauling’s request, the hearings were held in public, and the   proceedings published for everyone to read.    The primary purpose of the subcommittee was to discover how the   11,000 signatures had been obtained. There were many who believed   that the appeal was Communist inspired, and once again Linus   Pauling found himself facing the old charge of communism.    Pauling answered every question frankly and clearly. Questioned   on his own attitude to communism he said: “At a meeting in   Pasadena, I testified under oath that a statement that I had   prepared to the effect that I was not a Communist, never had been   a Communist, and never had been associated with the Communist   Party, was true…”    Later on in the course of the proceedings, he stated: “I would   like to know more about Marxism than I know. I believe that we   never can know too much about anything…I do not understand   dialectical materialism, either. But I do not believe in   censorship. I believe in freedom of publication.”    He gave the subcommittee all the facts on how the appeal signed   by the 11,021 scientists came about.    But when the subcommittee asked to be supplied with a list of   names of those who had assisted him in collecting signatures, he   replied: “I think that my reputation and example may well have   led many young people to work for peace in this way. My   conscience does not allow me to protect myself by sacrificing   these idealistic and hopeful people. And I am not going to do   it… For (he continued later) anyone called before this   committee is rendered vulnerable. He may lose his job.”    It was a serious matter for Linus Pauling to refuse to answer   questions put to him by the subcommittee, and he realized that he   risked a prison sentence for contempt of Congress.    Pauling endeavored to secure a court ruling that the   subcommittee’s demand that he submit the names of those who had   helped him to collect signatures violated the constitutional   right of every citizen to appeal to the authorities. Pauling   failed to secure a favorable verdict in two instances. His appeal   to the Supreme Court did not materialize, for the Senate   subcommittee dropped the matter. It merely published its findings   in a report which, incidentally, was strongly criticized in some   of the major American newspapers as being too one-sided and not   particularly fair to Pauling.    Although encountering opposition in various quarters, Pauling’s   name and his views became even better known, and the manner in   which his hearings had been conducted gained him added support,   as is so often the case when a good cause is attacked.    Undaunted, Linus Pauling and his wife, Ava Helen Pauling,   continued their campaign, delivering as many as a hundred   speeches and lectures a year. His wife has been a great source of   inspiration for Pauling, and the assistance she renders him is   invaluable. Her own peace lectures, with their special appeal to   women, have been influential.    It is impossible in a short address to touch upon all the   speeches Linus Pauling has made and all the conferences in which   he has participated. I must confine myself to a few of the   international disarmament and peace conferences, such as the   Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Hiroshima in   1959, where he personally wrote the resolution which was issued   after the meeting.    This states that an international agreement must be reached in   which the nations pledge themselves to terminate all tests with   nuclear weapons and not to produce new ones. Nor should these   weapons be distributed to other nations. A neutral zone should be   established between East and West. Among the countries to remain   neutral, mention is made of East and West Germany, with adjoining   countries, and Japan, but naturally not China.    In May, 1961, Linus Pauling and his wife convened in Oslo an   international Conference against the Spread of Nuclear Weapons.   Scientists from fifteen countries attended, and the main point in   the resolution adopted was that nuclear weapons must not be   allowed to spread to other countries, since such a spread would   inevitably increase the danger of some power’s willfully   unleashing nuclear warfare. Furthermore, the spread of these   weapons would also reduce the chance of a disarmament   agreement.    On September 1, 1961, the Soviet Union resumed nuclear testing in   the atmosphere and announced plans for detonating a fifty-megaton   nuclear bomb. On October 18, Pauling sent a telegram to Premier   Khrushchev4, earnestly entreating   him not to carry out this plan. At the same time he sent a   telegram to President Kennedy5,   requesting that the United States government declare that no test   explosions would be undertaken in the atmosphere provided the   Soviet Union revoked its plan to detonate the fifty-megaton   bomb.    He received a long letter from Khrushchev, dated October 26,   1961, the gist of which was that the Soviet Union considered   itself regrettably forced to carry out new tests with nuclear   weapons, and he was therefore sorry that he was unable to reverse   the decision already made. The reasons given were that the   Western powers were arming, and that the Soviet Union considered   its security threatened.    And so, despite his efforts, Linus Pauling did not succeed.    At this time he was also deeply involved in the problem of   shelters in the event of nuclear attack. He maintained that   shelters would not be able to reduce the number of dead and   wounded in a nuclear war because their construction might give   people the false impression that nuclear warfare was not, after   all, so dangerous. He strove in articles and speeches to   enlighten the general public on this point.    In November, 1961, Pauling and his wife were invited by the   Academy of Science in Moscow to attend its second centenary   celebration. While they were there, they were both asked to   lecture on disarmament and peace. Pauling’s lecture was based on   the same arguments he had used in the United States, but he   emphasized the danger of the new nuclear tests in the Soviet   Union. He was confronted with the argument that the Soviet Union   was compelled to continue its tests in order to be in a position   to obtain weapons capable of preventing the outbreak of a nuclear   war. Pauling pointed out that this was the very argument used by   those in the United States who insisted on continuing nuclear   tests.    During this visit in Moscow, Pauling applied for a personal   interview with Premier Khrushchev. When this was refused, he sent   the Russian leader two letters and a draft of an agreement for a   ban on nuclear tests. In the main, his proposal tallies with the   test ban agreement of July 25, 1963.    On March 1, 1962, the United States resumed nuclear tests in the   atmosphere.    In October, 1962, Pauling was in a position to state that the   tests undertaken in the Soviet Union and in the United States   during the course of the previous year or so had released twice   as much radioactive fallout as all the tests undertaken during   the sixteen preceding years.    In 1963, however, after what had long appeared a state of   permanent deadlock, discussions on a nuclear test ban finally   made some headway when the United States, the Soviet Union, and   Great Britain entered into an agreement. This was signed in   Moscow on July 25, 1963, and went into effect on October 10 of   this year. Most countries have now signed, the most important   exceptions being France and China. The agreement covers all tests   of nuclear weapons except those carried out underground.    In his magnificent speech to the American people on July 26 of   this year, the late President John F. Kennedy stated: Even then,   the number of children and grandchildren with cancer in their   bones, with leukemia in their blood, or with poison in their   lungs might seem statistically small to some, in comparison with   natural health hazards. But this is not a natural health hazard,   and it is not a statistical issue. The loss of even one human   life, or the malformation of even one baby-who may be born long   after we are gone – should be of concern to us all..    In his speech President Kennedy revealed that his views on   nuclear tests were based on the same moral attitude that Linus   Pauling has consistently maintained.    No one would suggest that Linus Pauling is actually responsible   for the nuclear test ban itself or for the efforts of the great   powers to arrive at an agreement acceptable to all parties.    But does anyone believe that this treaty would have been   concluded now if there had been no responsible scientist who,   tirelessly, unflinchingly, year in year out, had impressed on the   authorities and on the general public the real menace of nuclear   tests?    In his speech President Kennedy likewise stressed the great   danger of spreading nuclear weapons to more and more countries.   These were his words: “I ask you to stop and think for a moment   what it would mean to have nuclear weapons in so many hands, in   the hands of countries, large and small, stable and unstable,   responsible and irresponsible, scattered throughout the world.   There would be no rest for anyone then, no stability, no real   security, and no chance of effective disarmament.”    Even though the Test Ban Treaty has been effected, this is only   the first small step toward an agreement on complete disarmament   and peace.    Though the road may be long and difficult, Linus Pauling has an   unshakable belief that one day mankind will succeed in banning   war: “I believe that there is a greater power in the world than   the evil power of military force, of nuclear bombs – there is the   power of good, of morality, of humanitarianism.    In his opinion, it will be possible by enlisting these forces to   build a world community in which the actions of all nations will   be subject to just supervision and control, through the medium of   international law and justice.    As far as I know, Linus Pauling has not drawn up any concrete   plan for the future. But one thing is certain: he has great faith   in the role of science, as he shows in his suggestion for   establishing a World Peace Research Organization which would be   affiliated with the United Nations, and which would represent   every branch of science, including the natural sciences and the   humanities.    An organization of this kind must be based on knowledge and   wisdom. It is for this reason that Pauling has now left his   position at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena   and joined the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions at   Santa Barbara. He has taken this step, he tells us, because this   institution allows him greater freedom to continue his work for   peace.    He wants to use this opportunity for research in drawing up   concrete plans for the future.    It is Linus Pauling’s highly ethical attitude toward life – the   deepest driving force within him – that drew him into the fight   against nuclear weapons.    Through his campaign, Linus Pauling has manifested the ethical   responsibility which he believes science should bear for the fate   of mankind, today and in the future.    The scientist’s urge to wrest Nature’s secrets from her, is one   Linus Pauling can never satisfy. As long as the world exists,   there will always be bold, adventurous minds and new campaigns to   be carried on for new goals.    Should Linus Pauling, through his tireless efforts, have   contributed – if only a little – to restoring to science its   ideals, then his campaign will in itself have been of such value   that we living today can scarcely appreciate the full extent of   the debt we owe him.    1.

"39","1963","International Committee of the Red Cross, League of Red Cross Societies"," The Nobel   Committee of the Norwegian Storting [Parliament] has decided   to divide the Peace Prize for 1963 between the two sister   organizations of the Red Cross: the International Red Cross   Committee and the League of Red Cross Societies.    It is most appropriate that such a decision should be taken this   year, for it marks the centennial of the Red Cross. That it   should have been possible to constitute the Red Cross and start   its work in 1863 is one of the great miracles in human   history.    It was after the French-Sardinian-Austrian war and on the   background of the terrible massacres on the battlefields of   northern Italy that the Red Cross came into existence. On June   24, 1859, 300,000 French, Sardinian, and Austrian soldiers fought   at Solferino in northern Italy, the most merciless battle of the   war; and more than 40,000 dying, dead, and wounded were herded   into the little village of Castiglione. There was no organized   medical aid and no medical supplies, and there was no water. The   heat was suffocating; and in this hell on earth an idealistic and   pious young Swiss businessman from Geneva, Henri Dunant (he was later called by   Dickens “the man in white” and repeated the words which Dunant   adopted: Tutti fratelli. We are all brothers.), worked day and   night among the dead and the dying and pressed into his service   every man and woman of the neighorhood. The Italian peasant women   came to his aid and helped even the enemies.    Dunant had come to Italy for a conference with Napoleon1, but followed the call of his heart and   conscience.    The earlier decades of the nineteenth century had seen wars in   every country of Europe, and from the days of the disasters of   the great French armies, the minds of statesmen and soldiers were   busy with the idea of how to prevent wars and how to fight the   disorder and disorganization which followed in the wake of   war.    Fifty years before Solferino, General Dobeln, the great hero of   the Swedish war in Finland,2   wrote in his diary: “Happy the country where nothing is regarded   as little things, neither in peace nor in war.”    Dunant saw in Castiglione the indescribable suffering that came   as a result of the lack of preparation and the neglect of what   had been regarded as little things; and when later the idea of   the Red Cross was accepted with open hearts in England, it was   because the importance of “the little things ” had been   understood as a result of Florence Nightingale’s work,3 and there were public meetings very   much like those that were later arranged for the Red Cross. For   such a meeting in 1845 a young English authoress, Miss Craigie,   presented a poem called Little Things,4 which became very popular and was   recited in the schools of England and America and accepted as an   introduction to work for the Red Cross. Little drops of water,     Little grains of sand,     Make the mighty ocean     And the pleasant land.      Thus the little minutes,     Humble though they be,     Make the mighty ages     Of eternity.      Thus our little errors     Make a mighty sin;     Drop by drop the evil     Floods the heart within.      Little deeds of kindness,     Little words of love,     Make our earth an Eden,     Like the heaven above. Never have little things given greater   results. Last summer there were Red Cross societies in   eighty-eight countries, with a membership of nearly 170   million.    Henri Dunant had learnt to see the importance of little things,   and when in 1862 he published his book, Un Souvenir de   Solferino, which was a tremendous shock to public opinion in   Europe, he launched the idea to start, before any war broke out,   organizations of peaceful, idealistic women and men to work for   help to the wounded in war, friends and enemies alike. And should   it not be possible to bring about an international convention to   declare that wounded and medical personnel should be regarded as   neutral and under protection of the governments at war? His book   made an impression like that of Uncle Tom’s Cabin by   Harriet Beecher Stowe,5 and   stirred the conscience of responsible people all over   Europe.    In his native city of Geneva, La Societe genevoise d’utilite   publique [the Geneva Public Welfare Society] appointed a   committee of five – among whom was Dunant – to make his idea a   reality. And these five private individuals, without any official   status, really succeeded in arranging a conference at Geneva in   October, 1863, in which sixteen countries participated among them   Norway and Sweden. Here the Red Cross was organized, and in honor   of Dunant it adopted as its international emblem the inverted   Swiss flag – the red cross on white.    Until then every country – if it had any organized military   medical service at all – had had its own flag and symbols, and   there was general confusion behind the battlefields.    In 1864, the year after, delegates of twelve states, invited by   the Swiss government on the initiative of the Committee of Five,   met at Geneva and adopted the first Geneva Convention for   protection of sick and wounded in land warfare.    Gradually – and in the early years slowly – the Red Cross became   the mighty institution which it is today.    It is wholly independent of any government and completely   neutral. Its highest authority is the Red Cross Conference which   usually meets every four years and consists of delegates from the   National Red Cross Societies, the International Red Cross   Committee, the League of Red Cross Societies and representatives   of the governments which have signed the Geneva Convention. The   delegation of each national Red Cross has only one vote. The   decisions of the Conference bind the National Red Cross Societies   morally, but the Conference can only give advice and express   wishes.    The first International Red Cross Conference was in Paris in   1867, and the most recent one was in New Delhi in 1957 on the   invitation of the Indian Red Cross.    A permanent International Red Cross Commission of nine members   has been established to discuss every problem which arises   between the conferences and to decide when and where the next   conference shall meet. Five of the nine are elected by the   Conference from the national Red Cross organizations, two are   appointed by the Committee and two by the League.    The work of the International Committee has two branches, the   General Affairs Division and the Executive Division. The General   Affairs Division has worked to spread knowledge of the Geneva   Conventions and the principles of the Red Cross, a work which has   been of particular importance in all the new states; at the same   time the Committee has tried to make governments improve and   extend the Geneva Convention, which did not correspond to the   modern form of war, and four new conventions were adopted at a   conference in 1949, for the protection of the victims of sea   warfare, for the shipwrecked, for prisoners of war, and for the   protection of nonmilitary persons in time of war. But governments   proved most reluctant to accept any conventions that would forbid   atomic warfare and use of weapons whose destruction cannot be   controlled by those who make use of them.    The Red Cross Conference at New Delhi again adopted such   resolutions, and they were sent to the governments of all   countries, with the remarks of the International Committee. Most   governments have given no answer, and Mr. Boissier has commented   that it is not difficult to understand this silence. It will be   necessary to fight fear and hatred. And in this work is the   future of the Red Cross.    In many quarters there has been an idea that the Committee as a   Swiss body is more completely neutral and impartial than the   League. It was the Committee that was asked to take care of all   transportation and distribution of aid in Hungary after the   uprising of the people,6 but it   was the League that took care of the refugees, at a cost of more   than 100 million Swiss francs; and corresponding large sums of   money were given to the Algerian refugees7 and to the Congo8 – and it was a delegate of the   Committee who was killed at Katanga.    It was the Committee that was permitted by the government of   Nepal to give aid to the refugees from Tibet9 – for Switzerland, not being a member   of the United   Nations, had taken no part in any decision against Communist   China.    In the same way it was on the invitation of the Japanese Red   Cross, that the Committee repatriated North Korean prisoners of   war in Japan. Up to 1962 some 75,000 had been brought back to   their home country, and in Europe the Committee has been active   in repatriating refugees in even greater numbers and bringing   together families that had been dispersed. And the Committee   under the peace treaty with Japan has distributed the   compensation given to those who had been prisoners of war in   Japan, and in Europe to the victims of medical experiments in   Germany.    The work of the Committee is so closely coordinated with that of   the League that to all practical purposes they form a unity, and   in many fields they work hand in hand with the United Nations.   The great worldwide humanitarian work of the League falls outside   the sphere of the Peace Prize, but the cooperation between the   Red Cross Societies of ninety different countries of different   races, creeds, and color is of very real importance for   international understanding and peace.    In Mohammedan countries the Red Cross became the Red Half-Moon on   white, in Iran the Red Lion and Sun. But they all work loyally   together, and the successful efforts of the Red Cross Societies   in China and Japan which led to the repatriation of 30,000   Japanese prisoners in China in 1952 promoted peace in the Far   East, and corresponding efforts which led to an exchange of   prisoners between Poland and West Germany in 1955 had real   importance. Particular stress has been laid on the work of the   Junior Red Cross Societies. The Red Cross youth movement started   in the U.S. in 1923 and has been in constant evolution. Today   there are some sixty-two million members, and it cannot be   doubted that if millions of young women and men are taught in the   schools that we are all brothers-“Tutti fratelli” and that little   deeds of friendship and little words of love should bind the   world together, the ideas of Nobel will triumph.    1.

"40","1964","Martin Luther King Jr.","   Not many years have passed since the name Martin Luther King became known all over the world. Nine years ago, as leader of the Negro people in Montgomery in the state of Alabama, he launched a campaign to secure for Negroes the right to use public transport on an equal footing with whites. But it was not because he led a racial minority in their struggle for equality that Martin Luther King achieved fame. Many others have done the same, and their names have been forgotten. Luther King’s name will endure for the way in which he has waged his struggle, personifying in his conduct the words that were spoken to mankind: Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also!1 Fifty thousand Negroes obeyed this commandment in December, 1955, and won a victory. This was the beginning. At that time Martin Luther King was only twenty-six years old; he was a young man, but nevertheless a mature one. His father is a clergyman, who made his way in life unaided and provided his children with a good home where he tried to shield them from the humiliations of racial discrimination. Both as a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and as a private citizen, he has been active in the struggle for civil rights, and his children have followed in his footsteps. As a boy Martin Luther King soon learned the role played by economic inequality in the life of the individual and of the community. From his childhood years this left its indelible mark on him, but there is no evidence to suggest that as a boy he had yet made up his mind to devote his life to the struggle for Negro rights. He spent his student years in the northern states, where the laws provided no sanction for the discrimination he had encountered in the South, but where, nevertheless, black and white did not mix in their daily lives. Yet living in the northern states – especially in a university milieu – was like a breath of fresh air. At Boston University, where he took a doctor’s degree in philosophy, he met Coretta Scott, who was studying singing. She was from his own state of Alabama, a member of the black middle class which also exists in the South. The young couple, after being married, were faced with a choice: should they remain in the North where life offered greater security and better conditions, or return to the South? They elected to go back to the South where Martin Luther King was installed as minister of a Baptist congregation in Montgomery. Here he lived in a society where a sharp barrier existed between Negroes and whites. Worse still, the black community in Montgomery was itself divided, its leaders at loggerheads and the rank and file paralyzed by the passivity of its educated members. As a result of their apathy, few of them were engaged in the work of improving the status of the Negro. The great majority were indifferent; those who had something to lose were afraid of forfeiting the little they had achieved. Nor, as Martin Luther King discovered, did all the Negro clergy care about the social problems of their community; many of them were of the opinion that ministers of religion had no business getting involved in secular movements aimed at improving people’s social and economic conditions. Their task was “to preach the Gospel and keep men’s minds centered on the heavenly! ” Early in 1955 an attempt was made to unite the various groups of blacks. The attempt failed. Martin Luther King said that “the tragic division in the Negro community could be cured only by some divine miracle!” The picture he gives us of conditions in Montgomery is not an inspiring one; even as late as 1954 the Negroes accepted the existing status as a fact, and hardly anyone opposed the system actively. Montgomery was a peaceful town. But beneath the surface discontent smoldered. Some of the black clergy, in their sermons as well as in their personal attitude, championed the cause of Negro equality, and this had given many fresh confidence and courage. Then came the bus boycott of December 5, 1955. It looks almost as if the boycott was the result of a mere coincidence. The immediate cause was the arrest of Mrs. Rosa Parks for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white man. She was in the section reserved for Negroes and was occupying one of the seats just behind the section set aside for whites, which was filled. The arrest of Mrs. Parks not only aroused great resentment, but provoked direct action, and it was because of this that Martin Luther King was to become the central personality in the Negro’s struggle for human rights. In his book Stride toward Freedom he has described not only the actual bus conflict, but also how, on December 5 after the boycott had been started, he was elected chairman of the organization formed to conduct the struggle.2 He tells us that the election came as a surprise to him; had he been given time to think things over he would probably have said no. He had supported the boycott when asked to do so on December 4, but he was beginning to doubt whether it was morally right, according to Christian teaching, to start a boycott. Then he remembered David Thoreau’s essay on “Civil Disobedience” which he had read in his earlier years and which had made a profound impression on him. A sentence by Thoreau3 came back to him:”We can no longer lend our cooperation to an evil system.” But he was not convinced that the boycott would be carried out. As late as the evening of Sunday, December 4, he believed that if sixty percent of the Negroes cooperated, it would prove reasonably successful. During the morning of December 5, as bus after bus without a single Negro passenger passed his window, he realized that the boycott had proved a hundred percent effective. But final victory had not yet been won, and as yet no one had announced that the campaign was to be conducted in accordance with the slogan: “Thou shalt not requite violence with violence.” This message was given to his people by Martin Luther King in the speech he made to thousands of them on the evening of December 5, 1955. He calls this speech4 the most decisive he ever made. Here are his own words: “We have sometimes given our white brothers the feeling that we liked the way we were being treated. But we come here tonight to be saved from that patience that makes us patient with anything less than freedom and Justice. But, [he continues] our method will be that of persuasion not coercion. We will only say to the people, “Let your conscience be your guide.” Our actions must be guided by the deepest principles of our Christian faith … Once again we must hear the words of Jesus5 echoing across the centuries: “Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, and pray for them that despitefully use you.” He concludes as follows: “If you will protest courageously and yet with dignity and Christian love, when the history books are written [in future generations], the historians will [have to pause and] say: “There lived a great people – a black people who injected new meaning and dignity into the veins of civilization.” This is our challenge and our overwhelming responsibility.” This battle cry – for such it was – was enthusiastically received by the audience. This was Montgomery’s moment in history, as Martin Luther King calls it. His words rallied the majority of Negroes during their active struggle for human rights. All around the South, inspired by this slogan, they declared war on the discrimination between black and white in eating places, shops, schools, public parks, and playgrounds. How was it possible to obtain such strong support? To answer this question we must recall the strong position enjoyed by the clergy among the Negroes. The church is their only sanctuary in their leisure hours; here they can rise above the troubles and cares of everyday life. Nor would the appeal that they go into battle unarmed have been followed, had not the blacks themselves been so profoundly religious. Despite laws passed by Congress and judgments given by the American Supreme Court, this struggle has not proved successful everywhere, since these laws and judgments have been sabotaged, as anyone who has followed the course of events subsequent to 1955 knows. Despite sabotage and imprisonment, the Negroes have continued their unarmed struggle. Only rarely have they acted against the principle given to them by requiting violence with violence, even though for many of us this would have been the immediate reaction. What can we say of the young students who sat down in an eating place reserved for whites? They were not served, but they remained seated. White teenagers mocked and insulted them and stubbed their lighted cigarettes out on their necks. The black students sat unmoving. They possessed the strength that only belief can give, the belief that they fight in a just cause and that their struggle will lead to victory precisely because they wage it with peaceful means. Martin Luther King’s belief is rooted first and foremost in the teaching of Christ, but no one can really understand him unless aware that he has been influenced also by the great thinkers of the past and the present. He has been inspired above all by Mahatma Gandhi6, whose example convinced him that it is possible to achieve victory in an unarmed struggle. Before he had read about Gandhi, he had almost concluded that the teaching of Jesus could only be put into practice as between individuals; but after making a study of Gandhi he realized that he had been mistaken. “Gandhi” he says, “was probably the first person in history to lift the love ethic of Jesus above mere interaction between individuals to a powerful and effective social force …” In Gandhi’s teaching he found the answer to a question that had long troubled him: How does one set about carrying out a social reform? “I found” he tells us, “in the nonviolent resistance philosophy of Gandhi … the only morally and practically sound method open to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom.” Martin Luther King has been attacked from many quarters. Greatest was the resistance he encountered from white fanatics. Moderate whites and even the more prosperous members of his own race consider he is proceeding too fast, that he should wait and let time work for him to weaken the opposition. In an open letter in the press eight clergymen reproached him for this and other aspects of his campaign. Martin Luther King answered these charges in a letter written in Birmingham Jail in the spring of 1963. I should like to quote a few lines: “Actually time itself is neutral … Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts of men, willing to be co-workers with God, and without this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation.”7 In answer to the charge that he has failed to negotiate, he replies: “You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to … foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.” He reminds them that the Negroes have not won a single victory for civil rights without struggling persistently to achieve it in a lawful way without recourse to violence. When reproached for breaking the laws in the course of his struggle, he replies as follows: “There are two types of laws: just and unjust … An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law … An unjust law is a code that a numerical or powerful majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself … One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty.” Martin Luther King also takes the church to task. Even during the bus conflict in Montgomery he had expected that white clergy and rabbis would prove the Negroes’ staunchest allies. But he was bitterly disappointed. “All too many others,” he recalls, ” have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained-glass windows.” It is not difficult to understand Martin Luther King’s disappointment with the white church, for what is the first commandment of Christian teaching if not “Thou shalt love thy neighbor?” Yet even if victory is won in the fight against segregation, discrimination will still persist in the economic field and in social intercourse. Realistic as he is, Martin Luther King knows this. In his book Strength to Love he writes: “The Court orders and federal enforcement agencies are of inestimable value in achieving desegregation, but desegregation is only a partial, though necessary, step towards the final goal which we seek to realize, genuine intergroup and interpersonal living … But something must touch the hearts and souls of men so that they will come together spiritually because it is natural and right …” True integration will be achieved by true neighbors who are willingly obedient to unenforceable obligations. Martin Luther King’s unarmed struggle has been waged in his own country; its result has been that an obdurate, centuries-old, and traditional conflict is now nearing its solution. Is it possible that the road he and his people have charted may bring a ray of hope to other parts of the world, a hope that conflicts between races, nations, and political systems can be solved, not by fire and sword, but in a spirit of true brotherly love? Can the words of our poet Arnulf Overland8 come true? The unarmed only
can draw on sources eternal.
The spirit alone gives victory. It sounds like a dream of a remote and unknown future; but life is not worth living without a dream and without working to make the dream reality. Today, now that mankind is in possession of the atom bomb, the time has come to lay our weapons and armaments aside and listen to the message Martin Luther King has given us through the unarmed struggle he has waged on behalf of his race. Luther King looks also beyond the frontiers of his own country. He says: “More than ever before, my friends, men of all races and nations are today challenged to be neighborly … No longer can we afford the luxury of passing by on the other side. Such folly was once called moral failure; today it will lead to universal suicide … If we assume that mankind has a right to survive, then we must find an alternative to war and destruction. In our days of space vehicles and guided ballistic missiles, the choice is either nonviolence or nonexistence …” Though Martin Luther King has not personally committed himself to the international conflict, his own struggle is a clarion call to all who work for peace. He is the first person in the Western world to have shown us that a struggle can be waged without violence. He is the first to make the message of brotherly love a reality in the course of his struggle, and he has brought this message to all men, to all nations and races. Today we pay tribute to Martin Luther King, the man who has never abandoned his faith in the unarmed struggle he is waging, who has suffered for his faith, who has been imprisoned on many occasions, whose home has been subject to bomb attacks, whose life and the lives of his family have been threatened, and who nevertheless has never faltered. To this undaunted champion of peace the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament has awarded the Peace Prize for the year 1964.

"41","1965","United Nations Children's Fund"," The death of Alfred Nobel at San Remo on   December 10, 1896, robbed the world of a highly talented person.   At the same time the world was enriched by a document, a   testament, which has provided growth and stimulus to the ideals   and the compelling desire for research that provided the guiding   star in Alfred Nobel’s rich but lonely life.    In his will Nobel directed that the interest on his fortune   should be divided among those persons who have rendered the   greatest services to mankind. On the subject of the Peace Prize   he categorically states that it is to be awarded to the person   who has done most to promote brotherhood among the nations.    Alfred Nobel, particularly in the later years of his life, was   much preoccupied with the problem of peace. This emerges inter   alia from his correspondence with Bertha von Suttner, the author of the   pacifist novel “Lay Down Your Arms.” Many people imbued with   constructive ideas have, like Nobel, both before and after his   time, devoted their attention to this apparently simple but as   yet unsolved problem, that of promoting brotherhood among men and   building a world free from war. During the course of time many   profound theories have been developed to show how international   relations should be organized in order to ensure the attainment   of peace.    Personally, I have found no answer either in the works of the   philosophers or in those of the legal experts. Maybe, after all,   the only valid solution is to be found in the simple words our   own poet Bjørnstjerne   Bjørnson wrote as he lay on his deathbed in Paris in   1910. These words formed the first line of a poem which was never   completed but which begins as follows: “Good deeds save the   world.”    We have come together here today to pay tribute, by the award of   the Nobel Peace Prize, to an organization – UNICEF – because in   giving life to Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson’s words, it has   fulfilled the condition of Nobel’s will, the promotion of   brotherhood among the nations.    UNICEF was set up by a United Nations resolution on December 11, 1946. The   resolution was unanimous, but I well remember1 that in United Nations circles in New   York that autumn we had a great many discussions with various   politicians as to whether the UN really ought to organize a   children’s fund. The United Nations, many maintained, was a   political forum which was not justified in dealing with such   “minor, peripheral” problems as aid to children. During the war   the organization UNRRA had carried out large-scale humanitarian   work for children, prisoners, and refugees in Europe and in   China; for various reasons it was now being liquidated.2    A number of people expressed the opinion that, now that peace was   a fact, national children’s organizations should take over the   work of caring for the children of each country.    Today there is no disagreement on justifying UNICEF as part of   the United Nations.    As you know, it is not always easy to achieve unanimity in the   United Nations. This is understandable when one considers that we   are dealing here with 118 member states representing every race,   nation, political ideology, and religious creed. But everyone has   understood the language of UNICEF, and even the most reluctant   person is bound to admit that in action UNICEF has proved that   compassion knows no national boundaries. As soon as all the   resolutions relative to the form of organization, mandate, and   financing of UNICEF were clarified, the organization set to   work.    It was a blessing for UNICEF and the millions of children it took   to its heart that from the very first day of its existence it had   a leader like Mr. Maurice Pate.3   He was UNICEF’s never slumbering conscience. He never allowed   formalities to impede him in his work; in his opinion the   essential object was that good deeds should be carried out as   swiftly and as effectively as possible. He recruited his   fellow-workers from among those who were prepared   uncompromisingly, to quote Bjørnson, to   pursue “the policy of compassion.”    Maurice Pate was the head of UNICEF for eighteen years, up to his   death this year. He was an unassuming person, but on the road   that leads to peace, where politicians are still groping their   way in the dark, Maurice Pate has lit many a candle. He has been   succeeded by Henry Labouisse,4 a   man eminently qualified by experience for this task, who was   chosen by Maurice Pate, nominated by the Secretary-General, and   unanimously approved by the Executive Board.5    UNICEF’s first field of operations was in Europe.    What did Europe look like in 1946? And how were Europe’s children   living at the conclusion of the World War? The Swedish poet   Hjalmar Gullberg provides us with an unforgettable picture in his   poem “Europe’s Children”:    “That we had fixed the padlock on our fate, That hardly mattered;   Though finespun dreams had lulled the very soul, Our peace of   mind was shattered: Beyond the palings, Europe’s children hold   aloft Their begging-bowl.”    These were the children UNICEF came to help in Europe during that   fearful, bitter winter of 1947 – undernourished, ill, clad in   rags, homeless, and starved after five years of war and   occupation. We came across them everywhere – in the ruins of   cities, in refugee camps, in bombed villages in Hungary,   Yugoslavia, Albania, Poland, Italy, Greece, Rumania, and Austria.   UNICEF itself calculated that in Europe in 1947 the number of   needy children amounted to twenty million. It was for these   children in fourteen different countries that UNICEF provided a   lifeline – a stream of food, medicine, clothes, and footwear.   Never before had we witnessed an international relief campaign   for children on such a scale. During the winter of 1947-1948   UNICEF was able to report that it gave six million children and   mothers one meal everyday.    Fortunately the economic reconstruction of Europe after the war   proceeded relatively quickly. After four or five years our   countries were able to look after their children   themselves.    But no sooner did the European aid program approach a point of   solution than the outlines of another menacing specter appeared,   the inconceivable social misery of the developing   countries.    As each of these countries solved its problem of national   independence, the plight of their child population came more   sharply into focus. Suddenly in one single year, 1960, we find   seventeen new states inscribed on the map of Africa. In a matter   of a few years the membership of the United Nations rose from   fifty-one states to 118. The majority of these new states are   what we call developing countries.    Various factors, among them, the modern mass media of   communication – TV and broadcasting – with their dissemination of   factual information on the social misery endured in these   countries, made it a moral imperative for the wealthy nations of   the West to come to the assistance of these countries.    The United Nations Economic and Social Council soon realized the   scope of this task, and the efforts of its many specialist   organizations, such as the World Health Organization, FAO, and UNICEF, were directed to this   work.    In 1946 UNICEF had been organized as a provisional emergency   organization. In 1953 the United Nations General Assembly decided   to make UNICEF its permanent child-aid organization, with the   emphasis on work in the developing countries.    UNICEF now took up the second great task in its history, that of   improving the indescribably miserable conditions in which   hundreds of millions of children lived in the developing   countries.    UNICEF cannot do this work on its own. It can work only in   countries whose governments solicit its aid, and the countries   receiving this aid must contribute at least as much as UNICEF   itself in carrying out aid programs. While the aid given by   UNICEF generally consists of technical assistance, and of   commodities and equipment which must be purchased with foreign   currency, the recipient country makes its contribution in the   form of its own products, local personnel, transport services,   and so on. The interest in UNICEF’s aid programs for children has   been so great that the contribution of governments now comprises   two and a half dollars for every UNICEF dollar that is given. In   fact, the aim of UNICEF’s work is precisely to provide a spur to   self-help.    The aid given must cover all children in an area, regardless of   race, creed, nationality, or political conviction.    At the head of UNICEF today there is a board consisting of   representatives from thirty member countries; it is this board   that lays down the broad outlines of the work to be carried out,   evaluates requests for help, and decides the extent of such help.   Today UNICEF’s Secretariat consists of some 600 persons, some of   them working at the headquarters in New York, and some at the   thirty regional offices in Europe, America, Asia, and   Africa.    UNICEF is financed by gifts from governments, private   individuals, and organizations. In 1964, 118 countries   contributed a total of thirty-three million dollars.    What does UNICEF accomplish with this money?    First of all, it must be borne in mind that the field of work to   be covered is enormous, embracing over 118 developing countries,   with a total population of 750 million children, whose needs for   better food, better health, and better teaching are far, far   greater than the modest 200 million kroner now at the disposal of   UNICEF. This sum corresponds approximately to the amount which is   spent in the world today every two hours for armaments.    However, let us not be dismayed at the thought of the still   inadequate amounts of money available. What is most important is   that for the first time in history we possess an international   device capable of tackling the giant task of liberating the   children of the developing countries – who are, all of them, our   joint responsibility – from ignorance, disease, malnutrition, and   starvation. The most important thing is not the precise amount in   terms of hard cash; what is far more important is the   breakthrough of international cooperation that UNICEF   represents.    The English historian Arnold Toynbee says that our century will   probably be remembered, not for its two world wars, but as the   period in history when, for the first time, the idea of mutual   help between people, aimed at raising the standard of living   everywhere, was accepted.    Today, through its work, UNICEF is helping to confirm this   conception of the twentieth century.    When UNICEF started operations in the developing countries, the   task appeared so overwhelming that it was difficult to know where   to begin. To people aware of the tremendous advances made by   medical science in the countries of the West and the   comprehensive health services enjoyed by the inhabitants of these   countries, it seemed outrageous that hundreds of millions of   children should be suffering from diseases which we today have   means of combating. This group wanted to give first priority to   the campaign against such national scourges as malaria, trachoma,   tuberculosis, and yaws.    Others pointed to the limitless extent of undernourishment and   malnutrition on the one hand, and the tremendous surplus stores   of grain and meat in Western countries on the other hand. They   would have preferred to concentrate on the campaign to raise the   standard of nutrition.    A third group pointed to the necessity of overcoming illiteracy,   since an ignorant population could not possibly achieve the   economic growth that was needed.    Which of these courses did UNICEF choose?    It can be said that all three problems were approached   simultaneously, for it was realized that these evils – disease,   starvation, and ignorance – form arcs of the same vicious   circle.    When we consider the results that UNICEF has achieved today, we   must keep in mind that they have been achieved in fruitful   cooperation with the World Health Organization, with FAO,   UNESCO, and the various   technical aid organizations within the United Nations.    Cooperating with the World Health Organization, UNICEF has made a   sizeable contribution in the fight against malaria, a disease   which by 1955 attacked an estimated 200 million victims annually,   of whom two million died. When one hears these staggering   figures, he asks himself: Is there any use at all in taking up   the fight?    One of the best examples of the progress that has been achieved   comes to us from Mexico, where UNICEF, together with other UN   organs, was able to call on the services of 2,800 men who, on   foot, on horseback, and in motorboats, traversed the length and   breadth of the country, disinfecting three million houses with   DDT in the course of 1960 alone. Not a single death due to   malaria was reported in 1960. Agricultural production, too, went   up; and the government is now planning to move several million   people from the central, overpopulated highland areas down to the   areas along the coast which are now free from malaria.    In combating the painful and sinister disease of yaws, UNICEF has   made a major contribution. In 1946 this scourge afflicted a total   of fifty million victims; while the disease is not fatal, it   results in the stunting and disfigurement of the human body. And   yet this sickness, which brings so much misery to the individual,   can be completely cured by a single shot of penicillin at a cost   of five kroner.    When Indonesia became independent in 1949, its government asked   UNICEF to assist in the fight against yaws. It was calculated in   1950 that ten million people in Indonesia suffered from this   ailment. With the World Health Organization, UNICEF has succeeded   in liberating whole villages from this disease; and in a few   years’ time yaws will be completely eradicated in   Indonesia.    We could also mention the ten million children who were treated   for the tremendously infectious eye malady known as trachoma, or   the treatment given to millions of lepers in as many as   thirty-five countries. Mass examinations of the population and   anti-TB vaccinations have also been carried out on a massive   scale.    In the prosperous parts of the world we are concerned with our   diet problem. Many people are concerned because they eat too   much, and they worry about the ill effects. In the developing   countries, unfortunately, the problem is the very opposite.   Experts calculate that in these countries half the population are   undernourished or suffer from malnutrition. One of the results is   an infant mortality rate of up to four hundred per thousand. In   Norway it is seventeen per thousand.    UNICEF has launched a number of projects in an endeavor to   improve the nutrition of mothers and children. This work is   carried on through information work in the nearly 20,000 health   centers for mothers and children that UNICEF has organized. It is   also done by granting financial aid for the building of dairies,   of factories for the production of dried milk and for the   conservation of milk, or – as in Chile – for building a factory   for the production of large quantities of fishmeal. The aim is   primarily to encourage the production of foodstuffs rich in   protein, such as fish, which can be bred on a large scale in fish   farms or in paddy fields under water.    UNICEF’s initiative in these areas is important because it   represents the first systematic attempt ever made to coordinate   scientific endeavors all over the world to produce food rich in   protein for children in the developing countries.    I have mentioned a third area: the struggle against illiteracy,   to which UNICEF, in collaboration with UNESCO, has made a notable   contribution.    If we review UNICEF’s activities, we shall find that during these   years it has carried out hundreds of aid programs in developing   countries in the health-nutrition-and-education field.    Today UNICEF is about to embark on a third stage in its   development.    At the moment there is a tremendous interest in most developing   countries in working out nationwide schemes of economic planning.   In the discussion revolving around these development plans, the   primary matter of interest is how large investments can be made   in industry, agriculture, and communications. And yet, maybe   these words of Nehru6 contain a   dangerous truth: “In one way or another in all our thinking on   development plans for factory plants and machinery, we lose sight   of the fact that, in the last analysis, development depends on   the human factor.”    It is this fundamental viewpoint that prompts UNICEF’s efforts at   the present time to ensure that the interests of the children are   safeguarded in the development plans now being drawn up. UNICEF   is here building on the principle of the child’s right to social   security and education and of other rights adopted by the United   Nations in 1959 in the Declaration of the Rights of the   Child.7 And in the same way as we   have seen the fundamental principles of the Declaration of Human   Rights incorporated in the constitutions of many of the new   countries, it is hoped that it will be possible to incorporate   the rights of the child in the economic and social structure of   these new states.    It is this hope that inspired the invitation that was sent out to   attend the round table conference in Italy, initiated by UNICEF   in 1964. Those who took part in this conference were ministers,   economists, and child-welfare experts. The conclusion arrived at   was that, in the long run, no economic development is possible   unless the growth of a healthy and enlightened generation of   children is given priority in the plans for development.    Maximum aid must be given by the prosperous countries if this   gigantic task is to be accomplished; and we possess the material   and technical potential for giving this aid. The miracles of   technology seem to be limitless; we have within our grasp the   possibility of satisfying practically every material need on   earth. In fact, in our ambition we move beyond the confines of   this world, literally stretching our arms toward the moon. On the   other hand, there are millions of people who do not possess a   spade for digging their meager soil.    Today the people of the developing countries are fully alive to   their own misery; and they are determined to leave it behind.   They contemplate the riches of the West – our surplus food, our   fantastic technology, the health and good things that we enjoy in   life, all our material well-being – and they compare them with   the misery of their own children.    This contrast creates a dangerous tension factor which threatens   the peace of the world.    The aim of UNICEF is to spread a table, decked with all the good   things that nature provides, for all the children of the world.   For this reason the organization is a peace factor of great   importance. UNICEF has realized that children provide the key to   the future; the children of today make the history of the future.   UNICEF is now forging a link of solidarity between the rich and   the poor countries. In an age when so many people are terrified   of the destructive effects of the forces that science has placed   in our hands, UNICEF offers young people in all countries an   alternative worth living and working for a world with:    Freedom for all people,    Equality between all races,    Brotherhood among all men.    1.

"42","1968","René Cassin"," The last time the Nobel Peace Prize was   awarded to an individual was in 1964. The prize for that year was   given to Martin Luther King.   Today he is no longer alive. On April 4 of this year, so bitter a   year for human rights, he fell at his post as leader of the   Negroes’ nonviolent struggle for their rights. His death was one   of the most grievous losses ever suffered by the world’s   champions of peace and goodwill.    The Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament   gratefully remembers Martin Luther King and invokes peace for his   memory.    On November 27, 1895, in the Swedish Club of Paris, Alfred Nobel   signed his testament which later became so famous. This was   almost exactly one year before his death on December 10, 1896, at   San Remo in Italy.    As is well known, Nobel decided that the income from his fortune   should be divided into five equal parts and given as prizes to   those who had made the greatest contributions to mankind. There   is one sentence in this very short testament of his which makes   us think of this year’s Peace Prize laureate, Professor Réne   Cassin. That sentence is: “It is my express wish that in awarding   the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the   nationality of the candidates, so that the most worthy shall   receive the prize, whether he be a Scandinavian or not.”    It is this respect for human worth, irrespective of nationality,   race, religion, sex, or social position, which animates Professor   Cassin’s life and work. And it is primarily for his contribution   to the protection of human worth and the rights of man, as set   forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that   the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament today awards the   Nobel Peace Prize to Réne Cassin.    Réne Cassin was born in 1887 in Bayonne in southern France.   He drafted the United Nations’ Declaration of Human Rights which   was adopted on December 10, 1948, exactly twenty years ago today.   At that time Cassin was about sixty years old. But although it   was only then that his name became internationally known, he   already had a long and rich life of service to mankind behind   him.    Shortly after Cassin had completed his legal education, he was   mobilized in the First World War. In 1916 a German bullet made   him a war invalid and from then on he was mobilized in the   demanding struggle for peace.    Let me mention the great efforts he made during the aftermath of   the war in behalf of the disabled soldiers, the war widows, and   the 800,000 orphaned French children. The organization which he   formed and directed for their benefit had nearly one million   members.1 And it was Cassin who   was the driving force behind the social legislation which assured   these war victims the social and economic protection they had a   right to.    His work for those affected by the war was not limited to France.   In 1921 and the years following, he arranged several conferences   of war veterans from Italy, Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and   Austria. As late as 1932 and 1933 large demonstrations were   organized in support of the Disarmament Conference.2 Because of the disastrous political   developments during the 1930’s in Europe – the growing fascism   and nazism – these attempts to establish a climate of peace and   understanding among the war veterans from all countries came to   an end.    From 1924 until 1938 Cassin worked within the League of Nations   for disarmament. When the war in France in 1940 led to an   armistice after a few months, Rene Cassin was the first civilian   to leave Bordeaux in response to General de Gaulle’s appeal. On   June 20 he reached London, where he became de Gaulle’s minister   of justice in exile. Here he prepared, among other things, the   agreement between Winston Churchill and   de Gaulle which was to become the charter of the Free French   forces.3    The Vichy government4 then   deprived him of his French citizenship and sentenced him to death   in absentia.    The end of the Second World War was the beginning of perhaps the   most important stage in Réne Cassin’s life. It was at this   time that the people of all countries first came to understand   clearly what the dimensions and what the nature of Hitler’s war   had been. It had not been merely a total war for a political   objective. It had been an annihilation of ethnic groups, a   genocide which the world had never before experienced.    Public opinion was stunned by the reports of the atrocities in   the concentration camps and of the extermination of those of   Jewish origin. The general horror found expression in demands   made on the governments of all nations to prevent a repetition of   this assault on the value of human beings by adopting an   international Bill of Rights.    This idea was realized in 1945 when the United Nations included   the establishment of a Commission on Human Rights in its Charter.   The Commission’s task was to compose a Universal Declaration of   Human Rights and an international convention which would bind the   states to make these rights a reality.    Through one of history’s whims it was a representative of France,   Réne Cassin, and a representative of the United States,   Eleanor Roosevelt5, who became   the architects of the Declaration of Human Rights. Over a hundred   years before, both of these nations had adopted declarations   guaranteeing the basic rights of man. I am referring to the   American Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the French   Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.    But the Declaration of Human Rights, which Eleanor Roosevelt and   Réne Cassin were to leave their marks upon so firmly, moved   the stakes farther ahead than had either the American Declaration   of Independence in 1776 or the French Declaration of the Rights   of Man in 1789 – that is, it was also in the articles which dealt   with economic and social rights, being influenced by the Russian   Declaration of Rights of 1918.6    Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the Commission on Human   Rights, and Réne Cassin its vice-chairman. But it was Cassin   who drew up the Declaration.    Perhaps some will say that the work for the rights of man, the   struggle against discrimination toward the colored races, toward   minorities, religious groups, and women – that all of this is   noble, but does it have anything to do with peace?    No one has given a better, more truthful answer than Nordahl   Grieg7 has given in these words   in his poem “To Youth&quot: Here is your protection against     violence,     Here is your sword,     The belief in our life,     The worth of mankind. The fifty nations which adopted the   United Nations Charter in San Francisco in April,   1945, were also fully cognizant of the fact that lasting peace   had to be built upon respect for the rights and worth of the   individual human being. For what kind of peace can there be in a   country where the people are not free – where they cannot express   their thoughts or print their words, where they are not equal   before the law, where they are subject to torture and degrading   treatment?    In the Preamble of the Charter it is established that the   objectives are peace and security. In the next section the member   countries confirm their belief in the fundamental rights of man   and the worth of the individual. It was this firm belief in the   relation between respect for the rights of man and preservation   of peace which lay behind the United Nations’ decision to work   out this first universal declaration of human rights.    The Commission on Human Rights was confronted by a very difficult   task.    To be sure, the United Nations Charter does mention several times   that it will promote human rights. But we do not find these   rights defined anywhere in the Charter. So the question was: what   did human rights mean to the people from these fifty or sixty   nations, coming as they did from all parts of the world and from   different levels of cultural development, with diverse   traditions, religions, and ideologies? The West European peoples   have a somewhat similar understanding of this concept. But what   do the Chinese, the Indonesians, and the people on Haiti see in   the words freedom, equality, and cultural and economic rights?   Were there in general any points of contact between the welfare   states’ conception of these terms and that of the developing   countries? For example, in the European countries, we can agree   rather readily on what we mean by “the woman’s legal position in   society.” But how is it interpreted by the people in those parts   of the world where a woman’s value is equated with that of four   camels?    In view of all these difficulties, it is not surprising that it   took the Commission two years to work out formulations which   everyone could accept at the United Nations’ General Assembly at   Paris in 1948. But even there, where a completely prepared draft   was presented to us,8 we spent   two months in ninety-seven meetings discussing the Declaration.   And a total of 1,200 ballots was taken on proposed amendments   before the Declaration, with its thirty articles, was finally   adopted.    But we had thus brought into existence a Declaration which stands   as a standard for the common values of man, wherever he may live   in the world, whatever the social system he may live under. The   countries which voted for the Declaration did not commit   themselves, but declared themselves in agreement that all people   should have the right to life, liberty, and security of person;   that all are equal before the law; that everyone is entitled to   freedom of conscience, of religion, of expression, and of   assembly; that everyone is entitled to the right to work, to   equal compensation for equal work, to reasonable working hours,   and to free education. Finally, the last article, Article 30,   states: “Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as   implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in   any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of   any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein.”    To us who sit here, these rights sound like self-evident truths.   A glance at conditions in the world around us will convince us,   however, that in many states, yes, in most states, the promises   of this simple Declaration are written in sand.    In the area of international law, however, the Declaration was a   product of new thought. Whereas earlier treaties had regulated   the relationships between nations and governments, this new   Declaration made the individual himself the focus.    Man should be guaranteed these rights in whatever system of   social organization he may live. Therefore, we can say that the   Declaration of Human Rights is the constitution of a world   society. It expresses our common ideals, and it embodies a goal   which everyone can strive to attain. It is a standard by which we   can measure the quality of the political system of any   country.    The Declaration puts, therefore, a dividing line in history. It   breaks away from the old, set doctrines of international law;   yes, it allows us to look out over the boundaries of the old   sovereign states toward a world society.    I know that the skeptics and pessimists will be quick to say that   this lies a long way off. And I know they are right. But let us   look for some bright spots. For they are there. We can see how   the principles in the Declaration of Human Rights have already   taken root in men’s minds. Many of the seventy or eighty new   sovereign states established since the war have incorporated   parts of or even the entire Declaration in their   constitutions.    From a historical point of view I still believe that it is   correct to say that the adoption of the Declaration of Human   Rights on December 10, 1948, marked the beginning of a new era.   It might very well be the beginning of a revolutionizing   evolution which will realize President Roosevelt’s dream – a   world with freedom from fear and freedom from want.9    The Commission on Human Rights spent two years on the rough draft   of the Declaration. In its extremely laborious work, in which   each and every concept and the validity of each and every word   were thoroughly aired in all languages, Professor Cassin held a   key position. He formulated, defined, and clarified. He was   crystal clear in his formulations and steadfast in his goal, but   always cooperative and tolerant of the opinions of others. He   upheld his ideas vigorously, but whenever he realized they had no   immediate chance of being accepted, he was wise enough not to   force the issue but to bide his time. The years that followed,   which saw many new nations and new needs arise, proved to be   ready for several of the proposals initially rejected in 1948 but   now integrated in the text of the Convention.    Cassin also played a positive role as a mediator between the   Western European way of thought, which emphasized civil and   political rights, and the Eastern European viewpoint, which laid   more weight on economic, social, and cultural rights.    And when the declaration of Human Rights – that came from many   minds, many religions, many ideologies, and many hearts – was   finally constructed, it was primarily the engineering feat of   Réne Cassin. Then, how satisfied is Professor Cassin today   with his work? In an article in the Jerusalem Post several weeks   ago he says:    “The Declaration holds up an ideal for us, and it draws the guide   lines for our actions. But a glance at reality today is enough to   show us that we are far from the ideal. No country, not even the   most advanced, can pride itself on fulfilling all the articles of   the Declaration. Once the war and the ideals for which we fought   have faded in the distance and new states have gained their   independence, they are inclined to conduct their domestic affairs   as they wish without regard to human rights.    We are witnessing the violation of the right to live. Murders and   massacres are perpetrated with impunity. The exploitation of   women, mass hunger, disregard for freedom of conscience and for   freedom of speech, widespread racial discrimination – all these   evils are far too prevalent to be overlooked.”10    But Professor Cassin does not despair over these shortcomings. He   points to the significance of educational work, not only among   children, but also among adults, in producing fertile soil for   the growth of the Declaration’s ideas. And it was no coincidence   that Cassin also became one of the authors of the UNESCO Charter.11    In the work of making the Declaration of Human Rights legally   binding among the states, Réne Cassin has actively   participated in the preparation of the two Covenants, which,   eighteen years after the Declaration, were unanimously adopted by   the United Nations General Assembly on December 1966.    During the eighteen years separating acceptance of the   Declaration in 1948 and realization of the Convention in 1966, an   important political development has taken place in individual   countries and in the world as a whole. As an indication of this   development, one can cite the fact that approximately sixty new   countries became members of the United Nations between 1948 and   1966.    These new states had some interests entirely different from those   of the other states in the United Nations. For them it was not a   question of the old World’s classical political rights but of the   principles concerning the right of self-determination for their   countries and of control over their economic development.   Consequently, one can say perhaps that these merging nations   stood at the beginning of a development which the industrialized   countries had long since completed.    This strong new element in the United Nations also left its   imprint on the texts of the two Covenants, giving them a wider   scope than the Declaration had originally aimed at. Nevertheless,   for the first time in history, two international conventions   intended to give man certain fundamental rights were unanimously   adopted.    No country has yet ratified these two Covenants, one on civil and   political rights and one on economic, social, and cultural   rights. Thirty-five states must ratify them before they are   valid. It should be mentioned as a hopeful note that the   Norwegian government has declared itself willing to submit to the   Parliament a proposal for the ratification of the Convention as   soon as it is technically possible. It is reasonable to expect   that the other Scandinavian countries will do the same.    It was on just such a cold December day as this, exactly twenty   years ago, a little before midnight in the Palais de Chaillot,   this historic declaration of human worth and human rights was   adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations.12    To the millions of people who live today in the darkness of   oppression, this document was unknown. But a small light was lit,   and the moral commandments contained in the Declaration, like   those written on the tablets of Moses, will in the years to come   play a forceful role in reforming the conscience of man and his   understanding of what is right and wrong.    Today, where there is no respect for human rights and freedom,   there is no peace either. Every day youth falls on the   battlefield. Every day prisoners are led to prisons and torture   chambers. They fight and they suffer for the ideals which the   Declaration of Human Rights proclaims.    But the demand is made not only of them. It is made also of each   and every one of us who live in such secure conviction that we   have received these rights as inalienably our own. It is this   very year of 1968 – precisely the Year of Human Rights – that has   given us the tragic proof of the old truth: Peace, like freedom,   is indivisible; it must be captured anew by everyone every single   day.    1.

"43","1969","International Labour Organization"," When Alfred Nobel died on December 10,   1896, his will and testament revealed that he had instituted five   Nobel Prizes: one for physics, one for chemistry, one for   literature, one for medicine, and a peace prize.    While Swedish institutions were entrusted with the task of   awarding the first four prizes, Nobel decided, for reasons not   exactly known, that a committee of five members, appointed by the   Norwegian Parliament, should be entrusted with the great honor   and responsibility of awarding the Peace Prize.    Alfred Nobel not only specified who was to award the Peace Prize,   but he also laid down the rules to be followed by the committee   in choosing a candidate for the prize. He states in his will that   the Peace Prize is to be awarded to the person who has done most   to promote fraternity among the nations.    With this consideration in mind, the Nobel Committee of the   Norwegian Parliament has awarded the Peace Prize for 1969 to the   International Labor Organization.    Beneath the foundation stone of the ILO’s main office in Geneva   lies a document on which is written: “Si vis pacem, cole   justitiam.” If you desire peace, cultivate justice.    There are few organizations that have succeeded to the extent   that the ILO has, in translating into action the fundamental   moral idea on which it is based.    Why, we may ask, did the demand for social justice receive such a   tremendous impetus when the ILO was founded fifty years   ago?    I think the answer is to be found in the fact that at the   conclusion of the First World War in 1918, the underprivileged   members of the community were in the historical position of being   able not only to obtain the ear of Europe’s leading politicians   for social justice, but also of being strong enough, should the   need arise, to back their demands with force.    During the war, the working class had loyally set aside their own   claims in order to serve their national cause, and they had in   full measure borne the sufferings and privations of war.    But at trade union congresses held in 1916, 1917, and 1918, the   demand was made that the trade union movement should participate   in discussing the future peace treaty. It was emphasized that   workers should be guaranteed a minimum standard of working   conditions after the war and that a permanent body to ensure the   carrying out of international legislation in this respect should   be established.    In the wake of hostilities came a spate of violent social and   political upheavals. It is sufficient to remind you of the   Russian Revolution of 1917 and the German Revolution of   1918.    With such a background, it was something of a political   imperative, when the peace treaties in Versailles in 1919 were to   be drafted, to include clauses which aimed to secure peace not   only among nations but also among classes in the various   countries.    At its very outset the Peace Conference took the unprecedented   step of setting up an international committee for labor   legislation. The committee consisted not only of government   delegates but also of employers and employees, including Samuel   Gompers1, the U.S.A. trade union   leader, and France’s Leon   Jouhaux. Politicians were represented by Harold   Butler2 of the United Kingdom and   Eduard Benes3 of   Czechoslovakia.    In this way the ILO, along with the League of Nations, became   part of the Versailles treaties, in which guidelines for   international socio-political cooperation were laid down.4    Reading this special section of the Versailles Treaty and bearing in mind that it was   written in 1919, one is compelled to agree with Paal Berg5 when he declares that this was one of   the most remarkable diplomatic documents ever seen. In the   Treaty, for instance, is the following:    …the League of Nations has for its object the establishment of   universal peace, and such a peace can be established only if it   is based upon social justice.    And whereas conditions of labor exist involving such injustice,   hardship, and privation to large numbers of people as to produce   unrest so great that the peace and harmony of the world are   imperiled; and an improvement of those conditions is urgently   required: as, for example, by the regulation of the hours of   work, including the establishment of a maximum working day and   week, the regulation of the labor supply, the prevention of   unemployment, the provision of an adequate living wage, the   protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury   arising out of his employment, the protection of children, young   persons and women, provision for old age and injury, protection   of the interests of workers when employed in countries other than   their own, recognition of the principle of freedom of   association, the organization of vocational and technical   education and other measures; the failure of any nation to adopt   humane conditions of labor is an obstacle in the way of other   nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own   countries.6    This statement is followed by the guidelines for the ILO and the   principal tasks this organization should aim to accomplish. These   are summed up in nine points, which have often been called the   “Magna Carta” of the working class. Among other things these   include: the principle that labor is not a piece of merchandise;   the right of employees, as well as of employers, to organize   themselves; the right of workers to receive a reasonable wage;   the eight-hour day or the forty-eight-hour week; a ban on child   labor; equal pay for men and women for the same work; and every   country is furthermore to organize a system of labor inspection   in which women, too, are to play their part in ensuring that   labor legislation is adhered to.    The ILO was organized as a specialized organization, under the   League of Nations, to carry out this program.    And what has been the result? Have the fine words in a solemn   document come true, or were they merely writing in the sand, a   remote vision glimpsed by impractical dreamers?    As we look at the world around us today, we must admit that many   of the aims that the ILO set itself have been achieved in many   parts of the industrialized world.    Working earnestly and untiringly, the ILO has succeeded in   introducing reforms that have removed the most flagrant   injustices in a great many countries, particularly in Europe. By   means of a levering of income and a progressive policy of social   welfare, the ILO has played its part in these countries in   bridging the gap between rich and poor.    How has the ILO succeeded in carrying out such significant parts   of its program?    I believe that part of the answer is to be found in the special   form of organization peculiar to the ILO.    The ILO’s resolutions, passed at the annual Labor Conferences,   are backed by discussions and negotiations in which not only   government delegates participate, but also independent   representatives of leading employers’ and employees’   organizations in every single country.    Joint discussions of problems between these three independent   interest groups create a possibility of arriving at realistic   solutions of important social problems, as well as of deciding   how these measures are to be carried out in practice in the   various countries.    This is the structure of the organization. But its decisive   feature, what makes the mechanism work, is naturally the people   themselves, farseeing men of goodwill, inspired with a belief in   the possibility of building a peaceful world based on social   justice.    What means are at the disposal of the ILO in order to implement   its program?    In the first place, the ILO aims to create international   legislation ensuring certain norms for working conditions in   every country.    In the course of its fifty years of existence the ILO has adopted   a total of 128 conventions and 132 recommendations. These cover a   wide range, from working hours to equal pay for equal work, from   health insurance to the abolition of forced labor, from social   security for foreign workers to the task of securing the rights   of trade unions.    But are these measures respected in the various countries, are   they incorporated as part and parcel of the national laws? Or do   delegates in Geneva vote for the most sweeping resolutions, which   are then consigned to the bottom drawer in some government   department after the delegates go home?    It is precisely in this area that the ILO, one of the first   international organizations in the world to do so, has pioneered   in the international sphere, by creating organs which carry out   the work of supervising the implementation of the conventions   adopted by member states and their embodiment in national law and   practice.    Time does not permit me to illustrate this important point in   detail. Let me merely mention that the ILO’s constitution obliges   member states to draw up annual reports, stating what measures   have been taken to observe the provisions contained in the   ratified conventions.    Another important point is that the ILO constitution gives the   organizations in a country the right to lodge a complaint if a   government fails to carry out the conventions which the   authorities of that country have ratified. The right to lodge a   complaint also includes the right of a state to prosecute a   member state for violating provisions in conventions that both   states have ratified.    During these fifty years the ILO has adopted over 250 conventions   and recommendations. And even though not all its 121 member   countries have come anywhere close to ratifying all the   conventions, I believe we are justified in saying that the ILO   has permanently influenced the social welfare legislation of   every single country.    Norway has not ratified all the conventions as yet, but I am glad   to be able to state that Norway occupies seventh place among all   member countries of the ILO with regard to the number of   ratifications, having ratified a total of sixty-three out of 128   conventions.    The Norwegian minister of social welfare, Mr. Aarvik, declared at   this year’s Labor Conference in Geneva that, “out of sixty-three   agreements that our country has ratified, not less than   forty-three have had an important influence on the development of   working conditions and social welfare in Norway.”    When war broke out in 1939, the ILO was naturally faced with   great difficulties. The organization moved to Montreal in Canada,   where it continued its work for freedom and democracy against   Nazism and dictatorship.    One of the most important events in the activities of the ILO   during the war was the Labor Conference held in Philadelphia in   1944 on the occasion of the twenty-fifth jubilee of the   organization.    Forty-one states, among them Norway, were represented at this   conference. The Philadelphia Conference constitutes an historic   milestone in the development of the ILO, because, apart from   confirming the principles of the organization as adopted in 1919,   it also drafted a declaration expressing a new and more dynamic   conception of the ILO’s aims and responsibilities with regard to   combating insecurity and poverty.    At the invitation of President Roosevelt the conference was   concluded with a meeting in the White House in Washington. In a   speech to the conference, Roosevelt stated that the Philadelphia   Declaration was an historic document on a level with the United   States’ own Declaration of Independence in 1776.    When the war was over and the United Nations Organization was established   in 1945, the ILO was linked to UNO as an independent specialized   organization.    The ILO now had a far wider field of action than it had enjoyed   during its first twenty-five years.    Just as it may be said that one of the motivating forces for the   foundation and constitution of the ILO in 1919 was the social and   political upheaval that followed in the wake of the First World   War, so we can say that shifts in the international political   balance of power after the Second World War proved deciding   factors in expanding the aims of the ILO from 1945 on.    The old European colonial powers disintegrated, and over sixty   new states were given independent status on the map of the world   and in time, too, in the ILO. The ILO was no longer an   essentially European organization dominated by the special   conditions in industrialized Europe. The ILO had become primarily   a global organization, whose membership represented practically   all races and religions in the world, whose traditions, culture,   and history, economic and social problems were entirely different   from those with which the ILO had had to deal before the   war.    After the First World War the main task of the ILO was to build a   bridge between the poor and the rich within individual countries.   After the Second World War its task was a far more formidable   one, that of building a bridge between the poor and the rich   nations.    Today it can be said that the dominant feature in the work of the   ILO during the last twenty years has been technical aid programs   in the developing countries. Working in close cooperation with   UNO and its many specialized organizations – such as FAO, UNESCO, the World Health   Organization, the International Atomic Energy Commission, and   others and with financial support from UNO, the ILO has succeeded   in carrying out research projects and making basic investments in   developing countries, with a view to developing their   agriculture, industry, and other sides of their economic   life.    The birth of new states in Africa and Asia has not only enlarged   the ILO’s scope of activity; it has also created a certain   internal political tension in the Organization, which we   sincerely hope can be overcome.    The basic reason for this tension is that the ILO’s special form   of organization, with independent representatives for   governments, for free trade union organizations, and for   employers’ associations, has created problems with regard to the   membership of new countries because many of them have not as yet   developed free labor organizations. In these new countries,   governments nominate both workers’ and employers’   representatives. This is in complete violation of one of the   fundamental principles on which the whole organizational   structure of ILO is based. As yet we do not know how this   conflict will develop, but it is vital to the whole future of the   ILO that it should be solved in such a way that the independent   and political neutrality of the ILO can be preserved.    It is primarily the economic and social problems in the   developing countries that have confronted the ILO with the   tremendous task which it has undertaken to accomplish during the   next ten years and which has been called the World Employment   Program.    In the rich industrialized countries we consider an ample supply   of labor a sign of wealth. Since the war we have also gradually   learned the technique of controlling the economic climate in such   a way that we have avoided the unemployment with which, as a mass   phenomenon, we were familiar before the war.    In the developing countries, on the other hand, unemployment and   underemployment are today social evils which hold millions of   people in the grip of hopeless poverty.    A certain growth can be noted in the economic life of these   countries, but on the other hand a population explosion is taking   place which prevents this growth from promoting a rise in the   standard of living of the whole nation.    Millions of people consequently live on the borderline of the   physical subsistence level without any hope of enjoying their   share in a progressive development.    The ILO calculates that by 1970 the population of the world will   have reached a figure of 3,600,000,000 people. Of these,   1,500,000,000 will comprise able-bodied men and women. But in the   course of the decade commencing in 1970, the able-bodied   population of the world will increase by 280,000,000 people. It   is disturbing to contemplate that the bulk of this growth,   namely, 226,000,000 people, will take place in countries with the   least possibility for finding them employment; whereas the   industrialized countries, in which today there is frequently a   pressing need to increase the labor force, will show an increase   of only 56,000,000 people.    How then will the ILO tackle this gigantic task of finding work   for the whole population of the world? And what possibilities has   the ILO of solving the problem which has loomed largest during   our century, that of reducing, nay, removing, the gap between the   rich and the poor nations of the world, and of adjusting the   population explosion to a harmonious, economic, and social   evolution?    At the ILO’s Fiftieth-Jubilee Conference in Geneva this summer   the director-general of the ILO, Mr. David A. Morse, expressed   the hope he entertains for carrying out this plan in these   words:    “Let us make it possible for future generations to look back on   this fifty years’ jubilee conference as the prelude to an epoch,   an epoch where the instinctive solidarity between the people of   the world is mobilized in a joint worldwide attack on   poverty.”    This massed campaign against poverty will not only be organized   by the ILO – it will be supported by all the UNO special   organizations, as part of UNO’s Second Development Decade.    The first task of the ILO will be to send experts to those parts   of the world covered by the project – Latin America, Asia, and   Africa – to work with national authorities in drawing up a   long-term plan formulating objectives for vocational training and   employment of the population.    The other task will be to participate in a program of action   which will give effect to the plans that have been drawn   up.    The ILO cannot, of course, on its own create new jobs; but it can   give advice and help to countries desirous of putting their   populations to work.    The ILO can assist in such areas as the implementation of   agrarian reforms, agricultural projects, industrialization,   public works, the development of training and vocational guidance   programs, choice of investment possibilities, development of   trade, and so on.    For this reason the ILO’s plan does not consist merely of   collecting statistical data on the population aspects of the   problems involved. It will also have a direct bearing on the   entire economic and social development in these areas.    Through this work the ILO is endeavoring to promote the capacity   of developing countries to help themselves. No help from outside,   however well-intentioned and selfless it may be, can take the   place of the developing countries’ own will to help   themselves.    For this reason, carrying through the World Employment Program   will prove a challenge both to the developing countries and to   the industrialized countries; if they can work realistically   together, they will also achieve their ideal aim, a world living   in peaceful coexistence.    The ILO’s main task will be to ensure that this new world is   based on social justice; in other words, to fulfill the command   that is inscribed on the document in Geneva: “Si vis pacem, cole   justitiam.” If you desire peace, cultivate justice.    And let us add, as a summing up of our experience during these   fifty eventful years and as a guideline for the future: “Just as   peace is indivisible, so also is justice.”    1.

"44","1970","Norman Borlaug"," In the will and testament drawn up by   Alfred Bernhard Nobel on November 27, 1895, he laid down the   conditions to be fulfilled by a recipient of the Nobel Prize.   Paragraph One states, inter alia, that the award of the   prize shall be made to the person who, during the preceding year,   “shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind”.    The Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament must   bear this criterion in mind in selecting the prizewinner from   among the many candidates proposed.    What might be a “benefit” to humanity today? Many answers could   be given, just as varied, as many-sided, and as interesting as   man himself.    Does history not offer one signpost indicating and for all time   identifying the basic needs of man which it would be a “benefit”   to satisfy?    One of the great historical events in Europe during the course of   our dramatic century, the Russian Revolution of 1917, had this   inscription on its banner: “Bread and Peace.” Bread and peace   present a combination of the vital needs mankind has always set   as a goal vital to the development of its potential.    Freedom from starvation was furthermore one of the freedoms our   first global peace organization, the United Nations, recognized in 1945 as a basic   human right to be secured for all people. On October 16, 1945,   FAO – that is to say, the United Nations Organization for Food and   Agriculture, the first of UNO’s specialized agencies – was   established.    In 1949 FAO’s secretary-general, the nutrition expert Lord Boyd Orr, was awarded the Nobel   Peace Prize.    This year the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament has   awarded Nobel’s Peace Prize to a scientist, Dr. Norman Ernest   Borlaug, because, more than any other single person of this age,   he has helped to provide bread for a hungry world. We have made   this choice in the hope that providing bread will also give the   world peace.    Who is this scientist who, through his work in the laboratory and   in the wheat fields, has helped to create a new food situation in   the world and who has turned pessimism into optimism in the   dramatic race between population explosion and our production of   food?    Norman Borlaug, a man of Norwegian descent, was born on March 25,   1914, on a small farm in Cresco, Iowa, in the United States, and   originally studied forestry at the University of Minnesota. It was as an   agriculturalist, however, that he was to make his greatest   contribution.    In 1944 Borlaug was appointed to a post as a genetics expert with   the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1942 this Foundation, in   cooperation with the Mexican government, had launched an   agricultural program in Mexico. This project was directed by two   outstanding plant pathologists, Professors Stakman and J. George   Harrar1. Its aim was research into   and a better exploitation of agricultural know-how, with a view   to developing Mexico’s agriculture and in this way increasing and   improving local food supplies. For the outstanding contribution   to peace this agricultural program represented, the Rockefeller   Foundation was proposed in 1962 as a candidate for Nobel’s Peace   Prize by ten members of the Swedish Parliament.    It is interesting to note that the Norwegian Academy of Sciences   in Oslo, as far back as 1951, elected the leader of this project,   Professor Stalman, a member of its Mathematical Natural Science   class.    Twenty years later, in 1970, his pupil, Dr. Norman E. Borlaug,   was made an honorary doctor by the Norwegian Agricultural College   at Ås. The rector of this institution, Professor Jul   Låg, declared that this honor had been awarded for the   following reason:    “The basis for the award of the honorary doctoral degree to Dr.   Borlaug is the impressive result he has achieved in wheat   improvement, and the organization of the exploitation of the   results of this improvement in agriculture, particularly in the   developing countries. The new breeds of grain evolved by Dr.   Borlaug and his assistants have resulted in improvements in   harvest, quantitatively and qualitatively, that previously were   considered hardly possible.”    This distinction is only one of a great many academic honors   conferred on Dr. Borlaug by universities and similar institutions   in the USA, Pakistan, India, and Canada.    Dr. Borlaug went to the International Maize and Wheat Improvement   Center in 1944. Today he is director of the Wheat Improvement   Program in Mexico.    Ever since that day, twenty-five years ago, when Dr. Borlaug   started his work on the improvement of grain, and right up to the   present, he has devoted all his energy to achieving the   historical result which today is referred to all over the world   as the “green revolution.” This revolution will make it possible   to improve the living conditions of hundreds of millions of   people in that part of the globe which today might be called as   the “non-affluent world.”    Nations with ancient cultures, which right up to modern times   have suffered the scourge of recurrent hunger crises, can now be   self-supporting in wheat. A long and humiliating dependence on   the so-called rich nations of the world for their daily bread   will have been brought to an end.    Behind the outstanding results in the sphere of wheat research of   which the dry statistics speak, we sense the presence of a   dynamic, indomitable, and refreshingly unconventional research   scientist.    Dr. Borlaug is not only a man of ideals but essentially a man of   action. Reading his publications on the green revolution, one   realizes that he is fighting not only weeds and rust fungus but   just as much the deadly procrastination of the bureaucrats and   the red tape that thwart quick action. The following warning   reminds us of this: “a strangulation of the world by exploding,   well-camouflaged bureaucracies is one of the great threats to   mankind.”2    Dr. Borlaug cannot afford to wait: there is an important cause   weighing on his mind, something that must be carried out and must   be carried out now.    He puts it like this: “I am impatient and do not accept the need   for slow change and evolution to improve the agriculture and food   production of the emerging countries. I advocate instead a ‘yield   kick-off’; or ‘yield blast-off’. There is no time to be lost,   considering the magnitude of the world food and population   problem.”3    Apart from his work as a scientist and as an outstanding   organizer in exploiting the results of research, Dr. Borlaug has   also been an inspiring leader for the many young scientists who   have been trained at the Wheat Institute in Mexico.    Dr. Borlaug prefers to teach his pupils out in the fields. Many   people, we are told, who ask him to lecture or write a paper, get   the following reply: “What would you rather have – bread or   paper?”    In 1944, when Dr. Borlaug started work on the Mexican   agricultural project, there were not so many people concerned   with the relationship between the trends in population growth and   the increase in food production in the world.    After the war, when most colonial empires were gradually   dismantled, and sixty to seventy developing areas emerged as   independent national states, it was primarily the incredibly poor   standard of health in these countries that appealed to our   conscience.    Through its World Health Organization, the United Nations   launched a formidable attack in the 1950s on the major national   diseases in these new states. One of the results of the   preventive medical measures set afoot was a drastic decrease in   the mortality rate of the developing countries. And it was not   until the 1960s that the prospects of a population explosion   constituted a menace, not only to the developing countries but to   the whole world.    The population explosion is being attacked essentially from two   angles: by information on family planning and by an increased   effort, first and foremost through research, to increase the   agricultural yield.    When Borlaug and other scientists initiated their work at the   Wheat Center in Mexico, the Mexican authorities had little faith   in their country’s potential as an agricultural country. It was   assumed that the country had neither the climate nor the soil   required for advanced agriculture. The country spent a great deal   of its foreign currency importing the necessary wheat.    Wheat researchers attached to the Rockefeller Foundation’s   project were set the task of helping Mexico, in as short a time   as possible, to help herself. The scientists were to play the   role not of consultants entrenched behind their documents in   their offices, but of active participants in the practical manual   labor and toil in the fields.    For many young scientists this last principle may have entailed a   somewhat unpalatable reassessment of their social status, but it   was undoubtedly a wholesome maxim.    In his writings on the green revolution, Dr. Borlaug relates that   the Mexican wheat program aimed to analyze all the factors that   hampered production. Furthermore, the idea was to train young   scientists in all scientific disciplines associated with   production. The purpose of this research, Dr. Borlaug continues,   was to endeavor to develop a variety of wheat with greater   yields, with a great degree of resistance to diseases, and with   qualities that rendered it suitable for use in connection with   improved agronomic methods, that is to say, the use of artificial   fertilizers, improved soil culture, and mechanization.    The result of the concerted attack launched by the team of   scientists on all these problems was the new Mexican breeds of   wheat, which are now generally known, which produce astonishingly   large yields, which are resistant to disease, and which   facilitate intensive use of fertilizers. Unlike previously known   breeds of wheat, the new types can be transferred to remote parts   of the world that differ in climate.    The most important event in the Mexican Wheat Improvement Program   was the development of the so-called “dwarf varieties”. After   years of research on the part of Dr. Borlaug and his   collaborators to develop, by crossing and selection, the   so-called Japanese breed of wheat, they evolved the now   world-famous “dwarf variety”.    These are breeds of wheat which, unlike previously known   long-bladed varieties, have short blades. The long-bladed   varieties of wheat, on which work was done in the 1950s, gave   increased yields but snapped when they were given more than a   certain amount of artificial fertilizer. The new dwarf varieties   were able to stand two or three times more artificial fertilizer   and to provide an increase of yield per decare from the previous   maximum of 450 kilos to as much as 800 kilos per decare. These   varieties can be used in various parts of the world because they   are not affected by varying lengths of daylight. They are better   than all other kinds in both fertilized and non-fertilized soil,   and with and without artificial irrigation. In addition they are   highly resistant to the worst enemy of wheat, rust fungus or   oromyces.    Thanks to these high-yield breeds of wheat, Mexico was   self-supporting in this grain in 1956, and in recent years this   country has exported several hundred thousand tons   annually.    At the invitation of FAO, Dr. Borlaug visited Pakistan in 1959.   He was instrumental in having a number of Pakistani wheat experts   sent to Mexico to study the wheat research center there. After   striving hard to convince Pakistani authorities and other foreign   experts, Dr. Borlaug persuaded the political leaders of Pakistan   to recognize the advantages of introducing the new Mexican breeds   of wheat into their country. At that time the agriculture of West   Pakistan was producing a steady annual deficit in relation to   national needs. Wheat yields were low, approximately 100 kilos   per decare on an average. Farming methods were primitive, the   soil had been overcropped, and artificial fertilizer was a   rarity.    After a successful struggle to overcome bureaucracy, prejudice,   and even rumors to the effect that Dr. Borlaug’s variety of wheat   would produce sterility and impotence among the population, it   was finally decided that Pakistan should import a certain   quantity of Mexican seed corn of the new breed. Once the seed   corn had been introduced and had yielded superb results in the   form of increased crops, the triumphal march of the green   revolution was ushered in. Pakistan’s present-day wheat   production amounts to seven million tons, and the country is   self-supporting in wheat. That this could be achieved in the   course of three or four years was due in no small measure to the   fact that the President of Pakistan had personally supported the   program very strongly, and to the fact that the results achieved   in Mexico could be used as a basis, thus saving the country a   great many years of research and experiment.    Dr. Borlaug was in India in 1963 in order to find out whether the   breed of wheat he had developed in Mexico could be used in this   country too, and history repeated itself. The highest results in   the history of India were achieved in 1968 with a crop of   seventeen million tons. This event was celebrated in India with   the issue of a new postage stamp bearing the inscription “The   Indian Wheat Revolution 1968.”    After the successful results achieved in Mexico, India, and   Pakistan, the new varieties of wheat were introduced into certain   parts of Turkey, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Tunisia, Morocco, and   Lebanon. The Soviet Union, too, is now interested in establishing   contacts with the International Maize and Wheat Research Center   in Mexico.    This occasion is neither the time nor the place to give a   detailed account of Dr. Borlaug’s great results in wheat research   during the last twenty-five years. But it has been established   beyond doubt that his efforts have made possible an unequaled   increase in wheat production and an improvement in quality that   have postponed a crisis that a great many scientists have   predicted would be the result of the growing gap between the   population explosion and food production.    An assessment of the effects of Dr. Borlaug’s great contribution   makes obvious the fact that a whole series of factors is   involved, affecting not only economic, social, cultural, and   political affairs -and these not solely in the various developing   countries – but also affecting international relations. Problems   of major importance such as the aid given by the industrialized   countries to the developing countries must also be basically   reassessed. It is obvious that we can no longer count on the   export of grain to the developing countries. Loans for the   purchase of industrial equipment and technical know-how must be   given greater priority.    The new variety of wheat will be able to effect a total   transformation of the economic picture in the developing   countries.    Society will be richer and industry will be more varied if the   politicians at the same time pursue an economic policy which aims   at general economic growth. The increased earnings of agriculture   will ensure “ring-effects” in the form of growth impulses in all   the activities created by more productive agriculture. It will be   possible to increase employment: sowing, fertilizing, hoeing,   harvesting, marketing will have to be carried out several times a   year. Seasonal unemployment will be reduced: a balanced economic   policy, correctly pursued, should make it possible to provide   work for the large surplus of available manpower in the   developing countries. It is maintained, for example, by Lester   Brown in his book Seeds of Change that there might be a   shortage of labor on a local basis.    The new technology in agriculture could also stimulate such   branches of the economy as industry, building and construction   work throughout the social economy. For instance, the increase in   crop yields will require the building of artificial fertilizer   factories, roads, irrigation works, railways, warehouses, silos,   and mills. Outlying districts will be able to receive the   economic pollination necessary for the building of schools and   hospitals. From whatever angle we consider them, the effects of   the green revolution will entail increased total production that   will make the developing countries economically better off and   more independent of the aid provided by the affluent countries,   as far as foodstuffs are concerned.    In an article published in Foreign Affairs, the   agricultural expert Lester Brown states that the new breed of   grain in our age will have the same inpact on the agricultural   revolution in Asia that the steam engine had on the Industrial   Revolution in Europe in the eighteenth century.4 Or, as Eugene Black puts it, the new   grain varieties will be “engines of change.”5    Not least, these “engines of change” will transform the position   of the peasant in the community and the peasant’s attitude to his   own situation in life. A new policy of income distribution,   socially oriented, will enable the peasant to break out of the   vicious circle of poverty and the apathy which is a natural   consequence of penury that offers no future prospects. Many   writers who have dealt with the peasant population of developing   countries have maintained that the peasants are conservative, in   the sense that they do not want change. But Dr. Borlaug – who is   a great admirer of the peasant – maintains that when changes   involve a rise in the standard of living, the Asiatic peasant,   too, will accept change. To quote Dr. Borlaug: “Although the   peasant farmer may be illiterate, he can figure.”6    The new varieties of grain and the capital input required will   increase the peasants’ demands on the authorities for education,   transport, agricultural credits, and the like. The capital-hungry   peasants could constitute a political pressure group which the   authorities would have to take into consideration in framing   their economic policy. There would thus be an increase in   political activity.    Dr. Borlaug realizes, however, that even though the new varieties   of grain will involve a considerable increase in the crop   harvested by the peasants, the green revolution may also create   social problems of a negative kind. Social injustices may well   occur if politicians in the developing countries should fail to   ensure the requisite conditions by means of equitable taxation, a   system of agricultural credits at reasonable rates of interest, a   properly adjusted price policy, and a defensible employment   policy.    In his speech on August 20 of this year at the Agricultural   College at Ås, Dr. Borlaug expressed his social views as   follows: “I’ve worked with wheat, but wheat is merely a catalyst,   a part of the picture. I’m interested in the total economic   development in all countries. Only by attacking the whole problem   can we raise the standard of living for all people in all   communities, so that they will be able to live decent lives. This   is something we wish for all people on this planet.”    But this will be the responsibility and challenge to be faced by   the political authorities in the countries concerned. Through his   scientific contribution and his tremendous talent for   organization, Dr. Borlaug has introduced a dynamic factor into   our assessment of the future and its potential. He has enlarged   our perspective; he has given the economists, the social   planners, and the politicians a few decades in which to solve   their problems, to introduce the family planning, the economic   equalization, the social security, and the political liberty we   must have in order to ensure everybody – not least the   impoverished, undernourished and malnourished masses – their   daily bread and thus a peaceful future.    And this is precisely where Dr. Borlaug has made his great   contribution to peace. During the twenty-five years that have   elapsed since the end of the war, those of us who live in the   affluent industrialized societies have debated in almost   panic-stricken terms the race between the world’s population   explosion and the world’s available food resources. Most experts   who have expressed an opinion on the issue of this race have been   pessimistic.    The world has been oscillating between fears of two catastrophes   – the population explosion and the atom bomb. Both pose a mortal   threat.    In this intolerable situation, with the menace of doomsday   hanging over us, Dr. Borlaug comes onto the stage and cuts the   Gordian knot. He has given us a well-founded hope, an alternative   of peace and of life – the green revolution."
"45","1971","Willy Brandt","   The 1971 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Willy Brandt. The solemn Prize Award Ceremony took place on December 10 in the assembly hall of the University of Oslo. Their Majesties the King and Queen of Norway honored the ceremony with their presence. Mr. Willy Brandt was in attendance. The Nobel Foundation was represented by professor Otto Frostman. After the opening of the ceremony with the «Egmond ouverture» by Ludwig van Beethoven, rendered by an orchestra conducted by Mr. Öivind Bergh, the following speech was made by the President of the Nobel Committee, Mrs. Aase Lionæs, in honor of the 1971 Laureate, Mr. Willy Brandt: Your Royal Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen. A new war is casting its shadow on the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony. The fields once blessed by richer harvests through the research in wheat by the Laureate of last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, Normann Borlaug, are now bomb craters of death. Two developing countries that are in desperate need of peace to rise from poverty, India and Pakistan, are now at war. The degree to which politicians worldwide have closed their eyes and hardened their hearts to the new afflictions imposed on the innocent victims of war in these countries is appalling. Against this dark background, we double our thanks to those that work hard for peace. Our thoughts today focus mainly on someone who is no longer with us: Dr. Ralph Bunche. Ralph Bunche was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950 for his contribution to the armistice between Israel and the Arab states. Dr. Bunche was a noble and faithful advocate of peace throughout his long life – of peace between races and peace between peoples. He has been one of UN:s most unselfish servants for 25 years. He will always be remembered with profound gratitude by the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Storting (Parliament). Seventy years have now passed since the first award of the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1901, the prize was shared between the Swiss Henri Dunant and the Frenchman Frédéric Passy. Henri Dunant’s compassionate work for prisoners of war and people disabled in war lead, as is well known, to the foundation of the Red Cross in 1864 and the establishment of the Geneva convention. And Frédéric Passy’s pioneer work for volontary arbitration in international conflicts resulted, among other things, in the institution of the Interparliamentary Union in 1889. At this milestone, it seems natural to stop for a moment to think of the man who, through his exceptional will, laid the foundation for the Nobel Prizes, the most glorious of all international marks of honour. Many have wondered why Alfred Nobel, whose main research area was chemistry, would give one fifth of his estate for the founding of a peace prize. The suggested reasons for this have also been many. Maybe he was influenced by the peace ideals of the English poet Shelley or maybe, more likely, it was his close friendship with the peace advocate Bertha von Suttner that lead him in this direction. In a letter to her, Nobel discusses the possibility of organized work for world peace, a rather remarkable idea at the time and, as it turned out, also a profetic one. He writes: «The best solution would be a treaty, whereby all governments commit themselves to jointly defend one another in case of an attack. This would subsequently lead to partial demobilization.» With the creation of the UN in 1945, this vision of Nobel’s became one of the fundamental principles in the organization’s Charter. Many attempts have been made during these 70 years to realize Nobel’s dream of peace. This year, the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Storting have chosen to give the Peace Prize to a man for whom the ideal of peace has been a guiding-star throughout his active political career – Federal Chancellor Willy Brandt. Willy Brandt is the fourth German citizen who has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. We remember his predecessors: Foreign Secretary Gustav Stresemann, Mr. Ludwig Quidde, the historian, and the journalist Carl von Ossietzky. Willy Brandt was born in Lübeck in 1913. His early youth coincides with one of the most tragic periods in the modern history of Germany, the advance of Nazism and the atroceous violations by the Hitler dictatorship of human dignity, first in Germany but later also in many other European countries. The pattern of Willy Brandt’s life was formed by his resistance to the Nazi regime violations. Already in 1933, at the early age of 19, he came to Norway as a political refugee. In Norway, he spent seven important years of his youth as an active journalist. Brandt shared his time between work, studies and intensive efforts to help the victims of Nazism, both those that were refugees outside Germany and those that were held captive in German concentration camps. On November 23 of 1936, the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Storting decided to award the Peace Prize to the German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky. Ossietzky was a journalist with «die Weltbühne», a periodical in which he repudiated the German mobilization without compromise. Ossietzky was arrested already the night of the Parliament fire. After that, he spent five long years of suffering and humiliation as Hitler’s prisoner in the concentration camps of Papenburg-Esterwegen. In 1946, Albert Einstein wrote the following on the subject of Ossietzky having been awarded the Peace Prize: «The bestowal of an honour of this magnitude on this simple marture will be forever meriting for the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament.» The candidature of Ossietzky was discussed all over the world. One of the contributions in this discussion came from Heinrich Mann, who wrote the following: «Ossi, who can no longer speak or write, has still had the good fortune of having the world’s conscience emerging for a moment and witnessing on his behalf, and the language that was spoken was his name.» In remembering the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Ossietzky in 1936, we shall not forget the hard work of the young German refugee Willy Brandt in support of Ossietzky’s candidature. When Ossietzky was finally elected for the prize, he did not let his fears stand in the way. Imprisoned and marked by death, he resisted Göring’s pressure to renounce the prize. When the war reached Norway in 1940, Willy Brandt, as many others, was forced to leave the country. As Hitler-Germany had deprived Willy Brandt of his German citizenship, the Norwegian Parliament granted him Norwegian citizenship while he was a refugee in Sweden. In Sweden, Willy Brandt continued his work for democracy in Germany and for the freedom of Norway. There is hardly any other Norwegian journalist, who has written so many articles and so many books on Norway’s struggle for freedom as Willy Brandt. Among the many publications, I can mention but a few: The war in Norway, Norway continues its struggles, The struggle of the University of Oslo, Norway’s way to freedom and many, many more articles and lectures to create the necessary understanding in Sweden for the struggle for freedom in the occupied Norway during the first years of the war. Our country is deeply indebted to Willy Brandt for his deeds during these evil years. With the coming of peace in the spring of 1945, Willy Brandt was offered prominent positions in Norway and Germany, as well as in other countries. After one year as a Norwegian press attaché in Berlin, he chose to make his living in his native country, a country in ruins suffering from total defeat. With Germany at a zero position, economically and morally, Willy Brandt wanted to be part of the building of a democratic Germany together with other freedom-loving people. What we remember best of Willy Brandt’s work in Germany during the first post-war years is his courageous work for the freedom of Berlin. And Norway’s and other countries’ concern for Berlin’s struggle for freedom might be related to a feeling that defeat for Berlin would also mean defeat for peace in Europe. Willy Brandt wrote in his book «My way to Berlin»: «If we had given up Berlin, world peace would be even more fragile today. Keeping the peace is essential, but it is not less important to secure freedom and contribute to the breakthrough of justice ». The self-control and the courage, which I suspect was often a courage of despair, that Willy Brandt displayed in critical situations when he was the mayor of Berlin – a city under great political pressure and great unrest and with the erection of the «Wall» in 1961 – saved Berlin from the risk of a catastrophy of great dimensions. After Berlin, Willy Brandt left for Bonn and the Bundestag (Parliament). He became the leader of the Social Democratic Party and was the party’s candidate for Chancellor in 1961, 1965 and 1969. In 1966, the political situation in Germany led to a coalition government between the two major parties, the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats. In this government, Willy Brandt served as Foreign Secretary and Vice Chancellor. And it is from this new and wider political perspective that he is able to take the international initiatives on behalf of his government that led towards the present hope of international détente. This possibility of renewal and a more distinct formulation of Germany’s foreign policy goals became, of course, even greater in 1969 when Brandt was made Federal Chancellor. It was the beginning of a new chapter in Brandt’s life and in the history of Germany. As is well known, the 1969 election lead to a new coalition government in Germany, this time between the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats. The declaration of this new government, with Brandt as Chancellor and Walter Scheel as Foreign Secretary, made it clear that the government wanted to pursue a policy characterized by continuity as well as by renewal. On the area of foreign policy, this resulted in an intensification of the previously pursued policy as well as in new signals. When the Federal Republic was formed in 1949, Konrad Adenauer became its first Chancellor. Adenauer stated, in his first Government Declaration, that West Germany belonged with the West European countries. From this evaluation of the international situation, the Federal Republic sought organized economic and military co-operation with Western Europe. Also many West European countries had expressed their will to look to the future rather than to the past, to reach out across the narrow and dangerous boundaries of nationalism in order to build a peaceful co-existence that would also include Germany. It was this policy of peace that helped Germany out of its isolation and the associated dangers and that led to the Rome Treaty and the birth of the European Community, EEC, in 1958. As Head of Government, Willy Brandt has not deviated from the principles of extending West European co-operation. On the contrary, he has added a new dimension to it, by stressing that a strong and co-operating Western Europe is a prerequisite to achieve a change from confrontation to co-operation between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. As is well known, there was a stagnation within the European Community from the beginning of the sixties when it came to its efforts of enlarging the Community. At the EEC summit meeting in the Hague in 1969, Brandt submitted a declaration of enlargement of the Community, which has been of great importance. This initiative by Germany was the starting-point for renewed negotiations about enlargement of the EEC. On November 6, 1970, the Chancellor said the following with reference to Germany’s contribution to the summit meeting in the Hague in the German Bundestag: «The Federal Republic of Germany has been a mainstay in the efforts to strengthen and increase West European unity and co-operation. And the new progress that is being made can again be related to German initiatives.» On October 28, 1969, at the Government Declaration parliamentary debate, Brandt said the following: «The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has stood the test for twenty years, is the organization that vouches for our security also in the future. The firm unity of the Treaty is a prerequisite for solidary efforts for détente in Europe.» Based on the strength and unity of West European economic and political co-operation, and with the support of the 15 NATO member countries, Willy Brandt’s government now took up a more active policy of détente towards the Soviet Union and other East European countries. The Nobel Committee expressed the following in its reflection to award Willy Brandt the Peace Prize: «The Nobel Committee has placed importance on the concrete initiatives that can lead to such a détente that Willy Brandt took when he was Foreign Secretary of the Federal Republic of Germany, from 1966, and when he was its Chancellor, from 1969.» These concrete initiatives are specified in 4 clauses in the Government Declaration of October 28, 1969. Clause 1 deals with efforts to be taken to deepen and enlarge the European Economic Community and strengthen the political co-operation within it. Clause 2 speaks of a non-violence agreement with the Soviet Union. Clause 3 expresses the will to initiate talks with Poland with a view to normalizing the relations with this country. Clause 4 contains a declaration that the Government wishes to sign a non-proliferation treaty. The Government signed a non-proliferation treaty already during its first year. With this first step, Brandt’s government paved the way for a meaningful dialogue between East and West. With his expeditious mode of action, he contributed to the clarity of and the trust in the Federal Republic’s will for détente. A policy of détente to successfully bring the peoples of Europe together requires both parties to step out of the trenches of the cold war. Brandt wrote in a book entitled «After the victory», published in Stockholm 1944: «The day will come when the absolute hatred of war will be forgotten. On this day, there will be a Europe for all Europeans.» Brandt’s East European policy is an attempt to bury hatred and seek reconciliation across the mass graves of the war. How important it was for him personally to carry out this task of reconciliation is demonstrated by his kneeling by the Jewish memorial in the former ghetto of Warsaw. The first concrete result of Brandt’s efforts for relaxation in Germany’s relations with the Soviet Union was the signing of a non-violence agreement in Moscow on August 12, 1970. In this agreement, it is established that all controversal issues shall be solved in a peaceful manner, and that peace only can be secured if both countries refrain from violating each other’s borders. Both countries declared that they do not have territorial claims on other countries and that they would respect the integrity of all other countries within their present boundaries. The agreement also contained mutual wishes for more economic, technical and cultural co-operation. The Federal Republic also confirmed in a letter from Foreign Secretary Walter Scheel to Foreign Secretary Gromyko that the agreement did not conflict with the political objectives of the Federal Republic of Germany, which were to act for a peaceful order in Europe that would make it possible for the German peoples to reunite through the right of self-determination. At the signing of this agreement, Willy Brandt made a televised speech to the German people, in which he referred to the Government Declaration: «Our national interests do not allow us to stand between East and West. Our country needs West European co-operation and understanding as well as the understanding of Eastern Europe. The German people needs peace in the full sense of the word, also with the Soviet Union and all peoples of Eastern Europe.» And he continued: «This has been and is our guiding rule, and it is this work for peace which is served by the agreement.» On December 7, 1970, shortly after the signing of the Moscow agreement, an agreement for normalizing the relations with Poland was signed. The most important part of this agreement was the Federal Republic’s recognition of the western border of Poland, i.e., the Oder-Neisse line. Furthermore, it was agreed that the two countries would have no territorial claims on each other. A German wish, that people of German descent who lived in Poland would be able to leave Poland at their own discretion, was not dealt with in the agreement but nevertheless accepted. In a speech made in Warsaw to the German people, Brandt said among other things: «I am well aware of the fact that this is a difficult journey. It will be of importance for a future in peace. The Warsaw Agreement shall be the symbolic end of sufferings and sacrifices of an evil past. It shall build a bridge between countries and peoples. It shall open a way that leads to the reunion of families that live apart and to borders that separate less than before.» A condition by the government of the Federal Republic for submitting the two agreements to the parliament for ratification was, however, that an agreement be made between the four occupying powers to secure the connection of West Berlin to the Federal Republic of Germany. This condition seems to have been fulfilled by the Four-Power Agreement that was made on September 3 of this year. In this general agreement, the four occupying powers agree to refrain from threats to use instruments of force in Berlin and to solve all problems in a peaceful manner. Movements between West Berlin and the Federal Republic have been facilitated, and the possibilities for the inhabitants of West Berlin to travel to East Berlin and the DDR are greater. The fact that the inhabitants of West Berlin will be able to visit their families behind «the Wall» is, from a humane point of view, of course one of the most important achievements. The agreements put a final end to an era where West Berlin was the place for confrontations between East and West; confrontations that have caused political crises and near-war conditions. Brandt made the following statement when interviewed by «Die Zeit» in November this year: «Of course, the Berlin agreements cannot solve all long-term problems for the city. This will only be possible when we have come substantially closer to a European peace order. «The Wall» is still there, but it is less impenetrable.» It is the four problem areas that I have tried to outline here that are the essence of Willy Brandt’s policy of co-operation and détente. This policy of his might pave the way for further initiatives to reduce tension in Europe. Willy Brandt himself mentions in an interview that there is hope for a mutual reduction in military forces as well as for de-escalation of armament in Europe, especially in Central Europe. Let us hope that a development in this direction in Europe will lay the foundations for a global order of peace. Last year, the Soviet Russian author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Alexander Solzjenitsyn, sent a letter to the Swedish Academy for the Prize Award Ceremonies, in which he says: «… However, I cannot disregard the fact that the award of the Nobel Peace Prize takes place on the Human Rights’ Day. The Nobel Prize winners cannot avoid the responsibility of this coincidence.» Willy Brandt’s peace plan for Europe is the evidence that such responsibility exists. His work for peace means possibilities for peoples of all countries to lead a dignified life without fear. What people want is to live in a Europe without separating walls and borders guarded by rockets, a Europe where – using the words of Henrik Wergeland – the branch of a rose bush is enough to designate a border. Willy Brandt’s peace work has had a difficult starting-point. We have experienced one of the most barbaric wars in history. We are in the midst of a devastating war in Southeast Asia. Peoples of the Middle East are arming themselves against each other. There are preparations for war in India and Pakistan where thousands of children already are dying of hunger and millions of hands are clasped in prayer for a meal. The only thing in abundance in these impoverished countries seems to be weapons. This brings to mind the following words by Franklin Roosevelt: «What we need more than an end to wars is an end to the beginning of all wars.» I see a hope for the future in giving this year’s Peace Prize to an active politician on the international arena. As such, he has a greater responsibility as well as greater possibilities of making a contribution that can subsequently bear the longed for fruits of peace. We can see for ourselves that Willy Brandt’s policy of peace has brought thaw to the cold political climate, and this instills hopes for a new kind of peace for the frozen earth of Europe. Achieving peace and keeping it is not a simple one-time operation. Plenty of sceptics and kill-joys will remind us about that. The struggle for peace is a continuous process – it is a project that has to be worked at every day, over and over again. But people cannot live without hope and belief. Therefore, we shall hope and therefore we shall believe that Willy Brandt’s gesture of reconciliation across the borders of old enemies will be interpreted in the spirit it was made. If these hopes are fulfilled, Willy Brandt will live on in our history as the great Peace and Reconciliation Chancellor of Germany."
"46","1973","Henry Kissinger, Le Duc Tho"," Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Ladies   and Gentlemen:    On January 23 of this year a ceasefire agreement was concluded   between the United States of America and the Vietnamese   Democratic Republic.    At its meeting on October 16 the Nobel   Committee of the Norwegian Storting decided to award the   Peace Prize for 1973 to Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho, the two   chief negotiators who succeeded in arranging the ceasefire after   negotiating for nearly four years.    For many long and bitter years the civilian population of Vietnam   and the fighting troops engaged on both sides had borne the   sufferings and privations of war. This was a war that concerned   not only Vietnam and its people; it was a war moreover that had   poisoned the atmosphere in countries and between countries all   over the world.    Never since the conclusion of the Second World War have the   people of Vietnam enjoyed unbroken peace.    At the conclusion of the World War France was faced in Vietnam   with a powerfully armed resistance movement under Communist   leadership.    Attempts to negotiate a solution to the problem of establishing   and recognising an independent Vietnamese state proved   unsuccessful. Open war broke out. Although the number of French   troops involved amounted to close on 400,000, France failed to   crush the opposition. After the defeat of France at Dien Bien Phu   in 1954 a ceasefire agreement was concluded at Geneva. A military   line of demarcation was drawn at the 17th parallel. The intention   was for the country subsequently to be unified after free   elections had been held. This, however, was not to be: the new   government in South Vietnam maintained that free elections could   not be carried out under the Communist regime in the north. As a   result two states emerged on the soil of Vietnam. Between 1954   and 1960 the two Vietnamese states took shape, a Communist state   in the north and a non-Communist one in the south.    In South Vietnam a guerilla movement, opposed to the government   in power, came into being. In the course of 1960 its activities   increased. At the end of that year a joint organisation and   command was established in the National Liberation Movement, the   FLN. It was acclaimed in North Vietnam, and the South Vietnamese   government maintained that the FLN was operating under North   Vienamese control.    During the years that followed the South Vietnamese government   failed to hold in check the increasing activities and influence   of the FLN. It was also clear that attempts to create an   effective administration and government in South Vietnam had   failed.    In 1964 decisions were made that resulted in the United States   during the next few years, committing American armed forces to   acts of war on Asian soil. These troops were at that time engaged   both in a civil war in South Vietnam and in a war between the two   Vietnamese states. This took the form of a large-scale commitment   of American forces on South Vietnamese soil, as well as air   attacks on targets in North Vietnam and on supply lines, through   Laos and Cambodia, for North Vietnamese troops. In March 1969 the   number of American soldiers in Vietnam reached maximum figures of   541,500 men. The escalation of the American commitment was   matched by a corresponding increase in North Vietnamese forces in   South Vietnam.    The world today is aware of the misery that the war has inflicted   on the people of Vietnam. The mechanical inhumanity of modern   warfare has gone hand in hand with the horrors of civil war.   There is no need here to repeat the uncertain but chilling   figures of the victims of this war – the dead and wounded, the   orphans, prisoners of war, deportees, and homeless multitudes,   fleeing from the theatre of war. The war proved a nightmare not   only to the people of Vietnam but to the entire world.    In 1969 the systematic withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam   commenced. By December 1972, out of a one-time total of half a   million, only 27,000 were still left. But the war continued, with   major offensives in South Vietnam and fresh aerial attacks on   North Vietnam – the latter as late as in December of last   year.    Nevertheless, the negotiations for a ceasefire and peace in   Vietnam, initiated in Paris in 1969, only suffered minor   interruptions. Finally, on January 23 of this year the United   States negotiator Henry Kissinger and the North Vietnam   negotiator Le Duc Tho arrived at a ceasefire agreement, which   they were able to sign on January 27.    The Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Storting was fully aware   that a ceasefire and not a peace agreement was involved. They   realised that peace has not yet come to Vietnam, and that the   sufferings of the population of Vietnam are not at an end. They   were also aware that events in Vietnam may yet endanger the   détente in the world. The ceasefire agreement was only the   first but a tremendously important step on the laborious road to   full peace in Vietnam.    It is our hope that the two chief negotiators and statesmen who   have been awarded the Peace Prize this year will show the same   understanding of the purpose and intention of the award as that   expressed by Chancellor Willy   Brandt in his speech here in this Festival Hall when he   received the Peace Prize for 1971: “Nobel’s Peace Prize is the highest honour, but at the same     time the one that imposes the greatest obligations, that can be     bestowed on any man bearing political responsibility.” In his letter of November 2 to the Nobel   Committee Henry Kissinger expresses his deep sense of this   obligation. In the letter he writes among other things: “I am deeply moved by the award of the Nobel Peace Prize,     which I regard as the highest honor one could hope to achieve     in the pursuit of peace on this earth. When I consider the list     of those who have been so honored before me, I can only accept     this award with humility.      The people of the United States, and indeed of the whole world,     share the hope expressed by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee     that all parties to this conflict will feel morally responsible     for turning the ceasefire in Vietnam into a lasting peace for     the suffering peoples of Indochina. Certainly my Government,     for its part, intends to continue to conduct its policies in     such a way as to turn this hope into reality.” I feel convinced that all right-minded   people will share the Nobel Committee’s pleasure at this   statement of Dr. Kissinger.    The Nobel Peace Prize is often awarded to persons who do not have   direct responsibility or share in the responsibility for the   policy of governments, for peace or war among nations. It has   been awarded to individuals and to organisations promoting   cooperation between nations in the endeavour to create a better   world – a world without hunger, a world of justice for workers, a   world in which human rights are respected everywhere, a world   without racial discrimination and racial antagonism. And the   Prize has been awarded to persons filled with the dream of a   world in which war is inconceivable.    But Nobel’s Peace Prize has also been awarded to persons   exercising political responsibility and heavily committed to the   confusing maelstrom of events. They were awarded the Peace Prize   because in the course of their activities they had indicated the   road that should be followed. No one could know whether this road   would be followed; but they had lit a torch on the long and   difficult road to peace among men. They were awarded the Peace   Prize because, within the framework of the politically possible,   they championed a peace which, though it might not be perfect,   was nevertheless a step along this road.    In the present-day situation it might be useful to go right back   to 1950, when the Prize was awarded to Ralph Bunche, the United Nations   representative in Palestine, for his contribution in negotiating   a ceasefire between Israel and the Arab states.    On three occasions since the days of Ralph Bunche – in 1956, in   1967, and now once again in 1973 – the ceasefire has been   superseded by open war in the Middle East. The road he indicated   by his own actions was not followed.    Today, finally, after the fourth war in the Middle East, there   are prospects that the new ceasefire, as Bunche had hoped, could   form the basis of a peace which would provide lasting security to   all the people living in this part of the world.    In 1971 the Prize was awarded to a responsible statesman,   Chancellor Willy Brandt, for his personal contribution to a   détente, and to a policy of cooperation in Europe.    He had succeeded in convincing the majority of the German people   that the basis for a policy of peace and negotiation in Europe   must be a recognition of the actual power relationship in Europe,   and in this way of the fact that two German states are now in   existence on German soil.    This was not a perfect solution. But as a responsible statesman   and the leader of a nation in the heart of Europe Willy Brandt   opted for the peace policy which was the only possible one.    In awarding the Prize in 1973 as well to two responsible   politicians at the centre of events, the Nobel Committee of the   Norwegian Storting emphasises its belief that the approach to a   solution of the many controversies that have led to or may lead   to war must be via negotiations, not through total war aiming at   total victory.    The two negotiators who were awarded the Prize represent widely   differing systems – one an essentially western system, such as   the one in which our own Storting functions, the other a   Communist system. We are under no illusion that the differences   between systems and ideologies can be ignored; but the Nobel   Committee has been anxious to emphasise that in a world yearning   for peace, no one can assume the right to force his particular   system on others by armed might. Nations with different systems   of government must be able to live together in peace and solve   their controversies by negotiation.    Le Duc Tho has informed the Committee that at present he is not   in a position to be able to accept the Prize, giving as his   reason the present situation in Vietnam. In accordance with   current regulations the Committee has been able to withhold the   Prize until October 1, 1974. It hopes that conditions in Vietnam   will develop in accordance with the aims of the ceasefire   concluded on January 23, and this will make it possible for him   to accept the Prize.    This year Henry Kissinger was appointed Secretary-of-State in the   United States. In his letter to the Committee he writes as   follows: “I greatly regret that because of the press of business in a     world beset by recurrent crisis I shall be unable to come to     Oslo on December 10 for the award ceremony. I have accordingly     designated Ambassador Byrne to represent me on that occasion.     However, I would hope and consider it a privilege, should you     so wish, to visit Oslo at a future appropriate date to deliver     the lecture which I understand is customarily given by     Laureates of the Nobel Peace Prize.” The Committee is, of course, aware of Dr.   Kissinger’s burden of work this autumn. Nevertheless they   profoundly regret that he was unable to come here today to   receive the Prize in person. We are looking forward to hearing   his lecture at a later date.    Henry A. Kissinger was born in Germany in 1923 of Jewish parents.   In 1938 his family escaped to the United States. His father, who   had been a teacher, worked in an office in New York. Henry   Kissinger was called up for military service in 1943, and became   an American citizen. He took part in the concluding military   operations in Europe, and was responsible for the administration   of a small South German town administered by the occupying allied   powers. In 1946 he won a scholarship for study at Harvard University.   In 1954 he received his doctor’s degree for a thesis on the   European peace settlement after the Napoleonic Wars.    In the 1950s he conducted a study group at the Council of Foreign   Relations in New York. This group analysed the relations of the   USA to the Soviet Union, in particular problems of military   security in the nuclear age.    In 1957 he returned to Harvard, where he was appointed professor   in 1962. In the 1950s and likewise in the 1960s he wrote a great   deal on various political subjects. He also carried out research   projects for President Eisenhower and President Kennedy. Without   associating himself with any party he also helped to draw up   Nelson A. Rockefeller’s programme during the presidential   election of 1968. After 1968 he worked in an advisory capacity   for President Nixon. From January 1969 he was to play a central   role as advisor to the President on questions of national   security. In 1973 he was appointed Secretary-of-State.    In all Dr. Kissinger’s writing we catch sight of a basic attitude   which made him particularly suited to the role he was destined to   play in 1969. This attitude emerges already in local German   accounts of his conduct as an American administrative officer in   1945-46.    People still remember the way in which this young German-Jewish   emigré, who returned to the land of his birth seven years   later, wearing an American uniform, and seventeen of whose   relations had been murdered under the Nazis, made it clear at   once: “We have not come to take our revenge.”    This attitude reveals an early developed concept of the relations   between people and nations, an attitude which tolerated no   fanaticism – not even in a young man of German-Jewish blood, not   even in his dealings with a people that had allowed fanatics to   plunge them into a moral abyss.    In his doctoral thesis Kissinger deals with the protracted period   of peace that reigned in Europe after 1814, a period that lasted   with infrequent warlike interruptions for a hundred years, right   up to 1914.    In dealing with this period many historians emphasise exclusively   the military balance of power: no single great power was   militarily strong enough to endeavour to dominate the whole of   Europe – as Napoleon had done before 1814 and Germany was to do   after 1914.    Kissinger, on the other hand, places a great deal of emphasis on   the fact that peace was bound up with an international order,   based on universally accepted principles for the behaviour of   states in their relations to one another. In those days, too,   political systems differed widely, and the great powers had a   great many conflicting interests. But by and large they respected   these principles and rules, and on this basis they tried to   prevent differences of systems and interests leading to   war.    It was therefore quite natural that Kissinger should place very   great emphasis on diplomacy as a factor for the promotion of   peace as well, diplomacy both as a profession and as an   art.    The overriding idea in Kissinger’s views on foreign policy is   that peace must be based on rules to which all states, at any   rate the great powers, adhere in their conduct. It is not   sufficient for one single state, or a number of states, to do so.   On the contrary, a dangerous situation may arise if some states   desire peace at any price and fail to ensure that other states,   too, adhere to the rules.    In his doctoral thesis he expressed this as follows: “Whenever peace – conceived as the avoidance of war – has     been the primary objective of a power or a group of powers, the     international system has been at the mercy of the most ruthless     member of the international community.” A policy of this kind could lead to war,   and the most frightening example was the Munich agreement of   1938, in which the western powers sacrificed Czechoslovakia to   Hitler. There were people who believed that as the result of this   deal peace would be secured “for our lifetime”. At the time there   was a failure to understand that Hitler entirely ignored all the   rules of the game in international relations.    It goes without saying that in the case of a man with Kissinger’s   background the experiences of the 1930s were bound to set their   mark on his thinking. Whenever political extremists acquired   power in a state, they were dangerous, in his opinion, because   they were unwilling to accept any permanent rules in   relationships between states. For this reason he looked with   profound misgiving at the Communist governments, and this was to   affect his thinking with regard to the situation in the West and   its security in the 1950s.    At the same time, however, he was aware, at an earlier stage than   most people, of the dangers to mankind that the new atomic arms   involved. He was concerned with the problem of how the United   States and Western Europe would be able to defend themselves   without having recourse to supremely absurd means – strategic   atomic arms.    He pinned his hopes on the thought that in the age of atomic arms   all great powers must realise that their most important task is   to prevent the outbreak of nuclear warfare. It was of vital   importance to them to realise this, no matter what political   systems and ideologies they represented.    But recognition of this fact would also of necessity compel them   to develop a new relationship to one another, a new system based   on universally accepted rules, as had been the case in Europe   prior to 1914. This was Kissinger’s working hypothesis, the basis   of his great experiment in foreign policy.    In a world of this kind the United States should not, in his   opinion, try to play the role of “world policeman”. The other   powers, first and foremost the Soviet Union and China, should be   invited to join in as equal partners, enjoying the same rights in   this policy and with the same responsibility for peace in the   world.    Kissinger is no technocrat: when he set out on his journeys to   Moscow and Peking after 1969 he had no cut-and-dried solutions to   the problems, devised at his desk in Washington. He approached   these problems with his working hypothesis, his message, his   queries.    This great experiment indicates a way out of the world situation   created by the Second World War and the Cold War.    The policy Kissinger has attempted to put into effect since 1969   is closely bound up with the ideas he had arrived at long before   1969. No one is in any doubt as to his personal contribution to   the policy of détente.    In a recent interview he made it quite clear that it is precisely   because they have conflicting interests and different systems and   ideologies that it has become imperative to seek a   détente in the relationship between the great powers.   This is why it is so important to reduce the danger of nuclear   warfare. The détente provides governments with opportunities   to negotiate, and to act swiftly when required, as well as the   opportunity to show moderation. This was emphasised in connection   with the crisis in the Middle East.    This year’s Nobel Prize winner has been called a realist. He   cautions against the markedly ideological and emotionally   conditioned approach in foreign policy, in his own country as   well. This realism of his is deeply rooted in a considered   conviction, a fundamental ethical attitude which has remained   unshaken through changing times and situations. His preoccupation   has been the responsibility of the statesman in an imperfect and   multifarious world, full of danger. Now he himself bears the   burden of such responsibility.    In the years that lie ahead we shall know how far his experiment   will take us on the road to a safer world. But this depends not   only on Henry Kissinger, nor only on the United States.    One of the touchstones in the conflict is the Middle East;   another touchstone is the conflict in Vietnam. Here the result   depends on all parties involved in the conflict, both the states   in the actual area of conflict and the superpowers who are   involved.    In our part of the world, too, in Europe, negotiations are at   present going on for a détente, security and   cooperation within the global framework which this great   experiment has provided.    Today a handful of great statesmen are sitting down at the   conference table, deciding the question of war and peace in the   world.    But the millions of people whose fate is at stake cannot allow   the politicians to carry the burdens and responsibility alone. By   means of an active and positive world opinion we must make our   contribution to the fulfilment of our hopes for peace.    Irrespective of national boundaries the peoples of this world,   and not least the peace organisations, must speak with one voice,   the voice of peace, so loudly that the politicians are forced to   listen.    There are people today who cynically shrug their shoulders at   negotiated agreements. This is an amoral, nay, a dangerous   attitude. Ceasefire agreements between states must not be called   in question, they must not be interpreted merely as paper   resolutions, but as a moral and inviable obligation between the   states that have signed them. Only with an honest approach of   this kind to the intentions and obligations of international   agreements can they help us along the road to peace.    The peace at which we must aim must not be limited merely to the   avoidance of military conflict. Real peace in the world can only   mean that all of us, in every country, should make it possible   for people, irrespective of race, religion, ideology, or   nationality, to live a life free from fear, free from violence,   free from terrorism – a life in which the fundamental human   rights are the secure and imperishable possession of every single   human being.  "
"47","1974","Seán MacBride, Eisaku Sato"," Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:    A few years before he drew up his last will and testament, Alfred   Nobel observed in a letter to Bertha   von Suttner that his dynamite factories would be able to   bring wars to an end a great deal more rapidly than peace   congresses would ever succeed in doing.    “The day two armies can destroy one another in the course of a   second, there will be hope that all civilised nations will   demobilise their forces and refrain from waging war.” Thus as far   back as the mid-1890s Alfred Nobel foresaw a kind of total   retaliation.    After the first atom bomb had been tried out in New Mexico in   July 1945, the scientists who had carried out the experiment   believed that the world was faced with a new opportunity of   putting an end to all wars. Armed with a weapon of this kind,   humanity had reached a threshold: if this threshold were crossed,   both aggressor and defender would be doomed to destruction.    Total annihilation was the alternative to peace. Amid the awful   terror which compelled nuclear physicists too to urge the world   to come to its senses, a hope was born that disarmament and peace   would have a chance.    Inevitably, in a world rent by internal dissension, world peace   was made dependent on the establishment of a fearsome balance of   terror between East and West.    Even on the brink of disaster wars could not be brought to an   end. The old pattern was maintained in a period we have   erroneously called the post-war period as well. Lives are being   destroyed, property laid waste, minds darkened, and fear   fermented in every corner of the world. Maybe we have gradually   come to know more about the causes of war and discord; maybe we   have gradually realised our share of responsibility, too, for   tragedies enacted far from our own borders. It is comfort of a   kind to believe this. But we have not made any appreciable   progress in introducing measures to remove these causes, despite   all our efforts.    On a day such as this, with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize,   there are nevertheless good grounds for mentioning some of the   favourable aspects of the development. In recent years both   multilateral and bilateral negotiations have been initiated, with   a view to promoting détente and practical cooperation. We   are living in an era in which dialogue has largely replaced   confrontation and isolation. Only a few years ago a negotiating   pattern of this kind, of which we can now observe the contours,   would have been considered entirely Utopian. The whole world pins   its hopes and expectations on this exchange of views and   ideas.    I can see a ray of hope in the fact that a strong and vital body   of public opinion all over the world rejects violence and the   abuse of power. We are witnessing a world-wide wave of opinion.   Do not be misled into attributing this to war weariness, because   frequently men and women who have no personal experience of war   are in the forefront of this wave. Call it rather a genuine   belief in peace. The climate of opinion of which I am speaking   does not restrict its efforts to combating war alone. In large   measure attention is drawn to social, political, and economic   oppression. And this is just and right: the struggle against   injustice is a blow struck in the cause of peace.    The injustice inflicted on others strikes every one of us, as   fellow humans. One of the great torchbearers of our age in the   struggle for human rights, the Nobel Prize winner Alexander   Solzhenitsyn, has said that our aim must be to eliminate from   mankind the very idea that anyone is allowed to use force against   justice, law, and mutual agreements. At no time surely has this   idea been more accepted and understood in ever-widening circles   throughout the world than precisely in our own age. This is a   hopeful sign, in a world full of terrifying future   prospects.    No statesman, no government, will be in a position to act with   impunity without taking this body of opinion into account.    The Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Storting is charged with the   onerous task of selecting persons or institutions that merit the   award of the year’s Peace Prize.    It could hardly be expected that the decisions of the Committee   would not give rise to discussion. This has been the case ever   since the first award was made over seventy years ago. This   eloquently proves how difficult it is to define the concept of   peace. On previous occasions of this nature the Nobel Committee   has selected laureates whose efforts on behalf of peace have   covered a great many varied fields: they have included statesmen   negotiating round the conference table, defenders of human   rights, experts on international law, rebels, humanists,   idealists, pragmaticists, dreamers. They have all been   controversial figures.    On this occasion both laureates are from countries that have   previously not produced winners of the Nobel Peace Prize. In   fact, Eisaku Sato is at the same time the first Asiatic who has   received this prize. He comes before us today as a representative   of the only nation that has experienced the unspeakable horrors   of nuclear warfare. This terrible experience has left a deep   imprint on the Japanese nation. But for the rest of us, too,   names such as Hiroshima and Nagasaki are permanent symbols of   something that we must all strive to prevent for all future   time.    Seán Mac Bride is a citizen of a country that for many years   has been the scene of bitter, grievous conflict. His experience   has acted as a spur, urging him on in his many and varied efforts   to promote international cooperation.    Each of these two Peace Prize winners represents different   aspects of peace work. With the aid of the difficult art of   politics and negotiation they have endeavoured by practical means   to promote their ideals. The goals they have reached must   constantly be achieved afresh, since the peace and the justice   that the world so sorely need are constantly threatened.    Eisaku Sato was prime minister of Japan for nearly eight years,   from November 1964 to June 1972, a longer span than any of his   predecessors. In all democracies the position of head of   government is subject to attack from many angles, and Sato was   frequently the object of violent criticism. Upon assuming the   post of prime minister, Sato declared that he would aim to secure   for Japan an influence in international politics consistent with   the country’s status as a major economic power. Observers in   other countries had every reason to watch how this programme   would be implemented. Would Japan, in her more active foreign   policy, revert to a nationalistic approach? There were many who   feared this. Increased self-assurance, resulting from economic   strength, considerations of national prestige and domestic policy   might well have dominated in Japan, as has been the case with   other great powers.    It soon became clear that Japan would pursue a foreign policy   that aimed at promoting friendship with other countries.    After the war, many nations still had vivid memories of an   aggressive and militaristic Japan. Not least in countries that   had experienced Japanese occupation, the feeling of distrust was   considerable. With a sense of great expectation the world   followed the work of appeasement on which Japan had   embarked.    The basis of Japan’s foreign policy and security policy was   conditioned by the obligations imposed on the country after the   Second World War. The constitution Japan adopted in 1947 had   expressly stated that the Japanese people renounced rights that   had previously been regarded as essential to an independent   nation. “War and the threat or use of force are renounced as   means of deciding conflicts with other nations.” This is a unique   provision in a country’s constitution. This principle was   established by the American occupation authorities, and was   markedly influenced by this fact. In Japan militarism was crushed   in 1945, and strong pacifist tendencies made their influence felt   among the people.    As head of government, Sato frequently recalled that the anti-war   provision in the Constitution must serve as a basis for the   country’s policy. He emphasised three principles upon which his   government would base itself as far as nuclear arms were   concerned: “Never to produce arms of this nature, never to own them,     and never to introduce them into Japan.” The Japanese people have supported this   peace policy laid down by Sato, reacting very forcefully to any   indication that developments might proceed in another direction.   From time to time it has been said that the Japanese people have   developed an allergy against nuclear arms. An allergy of this   kind is a healthy sign, and other countries might well learn a   lesson from this.    Whenever Eisaku Sato, in his role of prime minister, emphasised,   as he did on many occasions, that Japan would only pursue its   goals by peaceful means, he undoubtedly expressed an opinion that   had the overwhelming support of the great majority of his   people.    Shortly after Sato had taken office as prime minister he set out   to improve relations with South Korea. A friendship pact was   signed between the two countries, and ratified in the autumn of   1965. Diplomatic relations were also immediately established   between the two countries.    This agreement proved the prelude to a systematic plan for   improving relations between Japan and a number of other states in   the Pacific area. In the autumn of 1967 Sato set off on a   protracted tour, in the course of which he visited, among other   countries, Burma, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Laos, Indonesia,   Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and South Vietnam. The   objects of his journey were to strengthen friendly relations,   stimulate trade, and inaugurate discussions, with a view to   promoting political cooperation and a more active cultural   exchange. It is widely accepted that increased trade is one of   the best ways of promoting international understanding. Once a   start is made in this practical field, and mutual interests are   discovered, the road will be clear for increased contact in other   spheres as well. This approach, as we all know, has played a   major role in East-West relations in recent years. In Asia Japan,   under the leadership of Sato, set out to improve trade relations,   increase aid to developing countries, and encourage a greater   measure of regional cooperation. Japan was responsible for   initiating a ministerial conference for economic development in   South-East Asia, as well as actively promoting measures to ensure   the realisation of the International Development Bank for Asia.   Japan has herself been among the major contributors to this bank,   on the assumption that the country carries a special   responsibility for the promotion of peace in this area. In Sato’s   opinion an important factor in this respect was that countries   would be in a better position to exploit their material and   cultural resources.    The Japanese friendship policy was faced with a fundamental   difficulty from the very start, inter alia because Japan’s close   treaty relations with the USA were criticised in certain   quarters, particularly during the Vietnam war. Not only did Japan   refrain from any military participation in Vietnam, but Eisaku   Sato urged the belligerents to come together, without imposing   conditions of any kind, in order to discuss a truce and peace.   War would never solve the political problems, Sato declared in   his speech to the Japanese National Assembly in July 1965. An   attempt on the part of the Japanese Government to investigate the   possibilities for a peace initiative proved abortive in the   spring of 1966.    As head of government, it fell to Sato’s lot to maintain a   balance between conflicting interests. While adhering to the   treaty with the USA, he also demanded greater independence. It   was particularly important for the Japanese people to reach   agreement with the United States on the return of the groups of   islands that the USA had occupied since the end of the Second   World War. After five years of ceaseless endeavour Sato succeeded   in coming to an arrangement whereby Japan was given sovereignty   over Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands. His success in doing so   helped to remove a serious source of friction in relations   between the two countries; at the same time it also helped to   strengthen stability throughout this area, and to convince the   Japanese people that their foreign political aims could best be   achieved through the medium of negotiation, and not by aggressive   acts or threats.    It was of particular importance to Japan that the agreement   ensured that no nuclear arms would be stationed on the American   bases on Okinawa. The agreement, when it was negotiated in 1951,   could be hailed as a step in the direction of fulfilling the   Japanese wish to safeguard its national security. Both the   security agreement and the actual peace pact presupposed that   Japan would have the right to self-defence, and the right to   participate in collective security compacts in accordance with   the United Nations Charter. It is on this basis that   Japan’s defence system is founded. It is generally accepted that   during the years that have subsequently elapsed Japan has shown   considerable restraint in this field. No great power has shown a   corresponding degree of moderation; in fact, a great many small   countries maintain military forces that are very much larger and   stronger than the Japanese. No single politician in Japan   deserves the sole credit for this. The Japanese people’s   opposition to any form of military resurgence is so strong that   no other policy would have been feasible.    In relations with the Soviet Union, too, marked improvements were   registered during Sato’s term of office. No peace agreement was   concluded with the Russians, because the latter insisted on the   right to the islands in the North Kurils, a claim no Japanese   government could accept. But during Sato’s term of office   cooperation was continued in the sphere of foreign policy and   trade, not least after an exchange of visits by the foreign   ministers of the two countries.    No diplomatic relations were established between the Chinese   People’s Republic and Japan. In common with a great many other   countries, the Japanese Government pursued a policy, which   entailed recognition of Formosa. In spite of this, several   important points of contact were established between Tokyo and   Peking. In connection with the Bandung Conference in April 1965   Prime Minister Sato’s special envoy had a conversation with Prime   Minister Chou En-lai in which the Japanese desire for closer   contact with the People’s Republic was expressed. Despite   political obstacles, trade between the two countries increased,   and the outside world noted inter alia that Japanese journalists   were allowed to work in Peking during the Cultural Revolution,   whereas journalists from most other countries were obliged to   leave the People’s Republic. On a number of occasions Sato spoke   of the need to hold the door to Peking open. However, as long as   Japan maintained recognition of the regime in Formosa it was   impossible to establish diplomatic relations with Peking.   Nevertheless it was of importance to the international atmosphere   that relations between the two states should all this time have   been marked by a sense of restraint.    In several disputes in Asia, particularly in the conflict between   India and Pakistan and that between Malaysia and Indonesia, Sato   intervened personally in order to persuade the parties involved   to settle their differences. The payment of considerable sums, by   way of compensation, to countries that had suffered under the   Japanese occupation, was another factor that contributed greatly   to improving relations with other countries during Sato’s   ministry. Long-standing differences were mitigated, and new   mutual “interests” were created. The good-neighbour policy, of   which Sato was the chief exponent, was well received in large   areas of Asia. That the economic influence of the Japanese should   have been the source of dispute and have encountered resistance   in no way alters the overall impression.    In awarding the Peace Prize for 1974 to Eisaku Sato the Nobel   Committee wishes to emphasise the important role the Japanese   people have played in promoting close and friendly cooperation   with other nations. Japan’s attitude has helped to strengthen   peace in East Asia, and to lay the foundation for economic growth   and progress for many countries. By countering the tendency   towards a nationalistic policy in Japan after the war, by   constantly emphasising the need for international cooperation and   understanding, by playing the role of arbitrator and thus helping   to iron out differences, Sato has made a major contribution to   peace.    The Nobel Committee has attached considerable importance to the   statements Eisaku Sato has made in which he has affirmed his   determination to adhere to his doctrine that Japan shall never   own, produce, or acquire nuclear arms. At a time of increasing   risk that more and more nations will acquire weapons of this   kind, it is important that Japan, under Sato’s leadership, signed   a pact on the non-proliferation of nuclear arms in February   1970.    At that time Sato declared that it was in conformity with Japan’s   national aims to prevent arms of this kind being acquired by more   states. The aim was to ease international tension, establish   friendly relations with every country, and help to set up   international contacts that would promote the cause of peace. It   was Sato’s hope that the non-proliferation agreement would be   followed up by effective measures resulting in a reduction of the   number of nuclear arms in the world. He also emphasised the   importance of ensuring that this pact should be the prelude to   practical progress in promoting general disarmament.    The non-proliferation agreement has as yet not been ratified by   Japan, although the government that succeeded Sato’s, confirmed   as recently as in the meeting of the United Nations General   Assembly this year that it would work to achieve this. The   responsibility for future decisions is not vested in any one   individual; I should like to emphasise that the attitude of the   Japanese people may well prove decisive in shaping future   developments. It is the hope of the Nobel Committee that this   year’s award will be interpreted as an encouragement to all who   work to ensure that the non-proliferation agreement will receive   the widest possible support.    Peace-loving people throughout the world cherish the hope that   the future development of Asia will proceed without the fear of   war and the resort to force. May the hope that the Pacific Ocean   will become a real ocean of peace be realised! In this   development Japan’s role is of decisive importance.    The other Peace Prize winner this year is the Irishman Seán   Mac Bride, who was born in Paris on January 26, 1904. As a young   man he witnessed the Irish struggle for independence, with all   its horrors. This experience was in many ways to prove an abiding   influence. After working as a journalist for a number of years he   studied law, and qualified to practise in 1937. This enabled him   to work more effectively for the legal rights of persecuted   individuals. After the Second World War he entered the Irish   National Assembly, the Dail Eireann, of which he was a member   from 1947 to 1958. From 1948 to 1951 he was Ireland’s foreign   minister. This was at a time when the Council of Europe was   drafting the European Convention on Human Rights. The object of   this work was to secure the acceptance of a convention in which   human rights would for the first time be accorded universal   international protection. It was a great day in European history   when the convention was finally signed by the foreign ministers   of member states in Rome on November 4, 1950. Mac Bride played a   dominant role in piloting this convention through to a successful   conclusion. From now on he was to devote his entire life to the   work of promoting greater respect for human rights, not only in   West Europe, but throughout the world. In speeches and in   articles he urged the authorities of every country to negotiate   and abide by international agreements guaranteeing the rights of   the individual.    In 1961 he was elected President of the International Board of   Amnesty International, and for   many years he was active as the fearless and vigorous head of   this organisation, visiting a great many countries to plead the   cause of persecuted men and women, taking up the cudgels against   torture, and urging a sense  of greater humanity and   neighbourly love. His field of activity covered Asia, Africa, and   America. His most important standby in this campaign was his own   energy and enthusiasm, and the support he received from countless   voluntary helpers in many countries. He mobilised the conscience   of the world in the fight against injustice. The organisation of   which he was the leader gradually achieved wider recognition and   greater influence. With unflagging zeal he tackled new and fresh   tasks. Mac Bride himself knows that it may take a long time to   create the change in the mental climate which in the last resort   will provide the only sure guarantee against brutality and   arbitrary encroachment on individual liberty. But he knows, too,   that there are countless people all over the world who consider   themselves bound by their conscience to play their part in this   struggle.    Mac Bride has worked both on the ideological and theoretical   plane and in the practical sphere. He has combined the duties of   an organisational leader and a field worker. In his work to   protect and strengthen human rights he has achieved a unique   position. As Secretary General of the International Commission of   Jurists from 1963 to 1970 he was also extremely active.    This commission was set up in West Berlin in 1952, its original   aims being to record acts of injustice perpetrated in East   Germany and other East European countries. But in time the   commission became active in the work of countering violations of   human rights in every country. A number of leading jurists from   various countries joined the commission. Norway was represented   by Terje Wold, at that time President of the Norwegian High Court   of Justice. The International Commission of Jurists, which issues   several valuable publications, has gained great respect for its   activities, and has maintained close contact with the United Nations   Organisations. An expression of the esteem in which the   commission is held is afforded by the fact that over fifty   countries, including Norway, make voluntary contributions to its   work.    Seán Mac Bride was extremely active as Secretary General,   and contributed in large measure to enhancing the reputation of   the commission.    He has always emphasised the importance of extending and   enforcing the legislative obligations to protect personal rights.   The individual state must assume obligations of this kind both in   its own national legislation and also as an integrated part of   international conventions. In this way, he believes,   international law can be developed and extended to provide a   guarantee of greater protection for the individual. When   Seán Mac Bride participated in a Nobel symposium in Oslo in   September 1967, for example, he launched the idea of establishing   a convention among the nations of East Europe for the protection   of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The convention   contracted by the member-states of the European Council was to   provide a pattern for a convention of the kind he envisaged. By   means of regional agreements of this kind he hoped it would be   possible to bring about a real measure of progress in the work of   securing such rights. He also maintained that a great deal could   be done to ensure that UNO’s Declaration of Human Rights became a living reality.   His ideal would be the establishment of a universal Human Rights   Court, with the authority to deal with complaints from   individuals who were being subjected to persecution in violation   of the universally accepted principles of justice. Seán Mac   Bride is of the opinion that no state can claim absolute national   sovereignty where human rights that are universally recognised   are concerned. Rights of this kind are the common property of all   mankind; the authorities of a country have no right to violate   these fundamental individual rights. We still have a long way to   go before we can reach this goal; but Mac Bride has emphasised   the value of discussing this idea, since a process of this kind   in itself serves to stimulate afresh our sense of neighbourly   love and respect for our fellow human beings.    Every violation of human dignity, no matter where it occurs, is   an affront to humanity itself.    Mac Bride’s active participation in organised peace work of a   great many kinds, inter alia in the International Peace Bureau, is widely   known and recognised. The history of the Peace Bureau goes right   back to the year 1892: it was established as a parent body for   the many pacifist associations that existed all over the world   and was to play an important part in the setting up of the League   of Nations. After the Second World War the Bureau was   reorganised, but its objectives remain unchanged, viz. to promote   international understanding and nonviolent solutions to   international conflicts.    The Peace Bureau was awarded the Nobel Prize as far back as 1910.   Over the years Mac Bride has occupied various leading positions   of trust within this organisation.    True to his entire attitude to the obligations of international   cooperation Mac Bride launched at an early stage the idea of   establishing a High Commissariat in the United Nations for the   protection of individual rights. This question has been debated   for a number of years in UNO’s committees and in the General   Assembly. Norway is one of the countries that has most actively   supported this proposal. Discussions in UNO last year and this   year unfortunately reveal that we still have a long way to go   before it will be possible to realise this idea. In the meantime   the work will have to be continued, with a view to making steady   if slow progress towards this goal.    During UNO’s Human Rights Year in 1968 Mac Bride took the   initiative in setting up a joint committee for the various   non-governmental organisations that championed the cause of human   rights. He himself was placed in command of this cooperative   venture, which proved capable of exercising greater influence   with its concerted efforts. His skill as a practical negotiator   is widely recognised and respected, and his powers of conviction   and idealism have been in evidence at countless conferences and   meetings.    For over twenty years Mac Bride has occupied a central position   in the work of promoting the cause of human rights. He has seen   his efforts crowned with success. All over the world his exacting   message, which in its simplest form is akin to the classical   “Love thy Neighbour”, has found an audience. That respect for   human rights is growing, despite all that we know still remains   to be done, is due not least to the endeavours of Mac   Bride.    In awarding this year’s Peace Prize to Seán Mac Bride the   Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Storting is paying its tribute   to an advocate and champion of this important work for peace. The   Committee is convinced that Mac Bride’s numerous friends and   supporters all over the world will share with him his pleasure on   this day, which is actually Human Rights Day. On previous   occasions the Nobel Committee has had an opportunity of awarding   the prize to others who have made a great contribution to the   cause of human rights. The name of Seán Mac Bride takes its   place in this circle of Peace Prize laureates who have shown   humanity the way through the darkness.    Mac Bride is at present facing a new and demanding task as UN’s   High Commissioner for Namibia. He has personally expressed   optimism with regard to the future prospects of this work. The   world will follow his future work in the service of the United   Nations with anticipation and expectation."
"48","1975","Andrei Sakharov","    Translation Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Ladies   and Gentlemen:    The   Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament has awarded the   Nobel Peace Prize for 1975 to Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov.    In the will and testament that Alfred Nobel drew up prior to his   death in 1896, he directed that the Peace Prize should be awarded   to the person who had “done the most or the best work for   fraternity between peoples, the abolition or reduction of   standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace   congresses”.    As is only to be expected, the Nobel Committee’s interpretation   of these premises has varied in accordance with changing   attitudes to the concept of peace over the years.    In the ranks of Peace Prize laureates during these last   seventy-four years examples of this are readily available. The   Committee has rewarded: champions of the ideas of international law;     champions of social justice, such as Léon Johaux;     for humanitarian achievements, such as Albert Schweitzer;     for pacifist work, such as Bertha     von Suttner and Carl von     Ossietzky;     for the promotion of human rights, such as Réne Cassin, Martin Luther King, and Albert Lutuli. From the very start the decisions made by   the Committee have frequently been the subject of criticism and   debate. This need not, however, mean that they were   incorrect.    The Nobel Committee is an independent body, independent of any   state authority, party, group, or individual. The basis of its   decisions rests exclusively on the directions and intentions   contained in Alfred Nobel’s will and testament.    For the Committee to allow its work to be influenced in any way   by fear or to be dictated by convenience or opportunism would   constitute an unforgivable dereliction of its duties.    This year the Nobel Committee has awarded its Peace Prize to one   of the great champions of human rights in our age.    In setting forth its reasons for its present choice the Committee   states inter alia: “Sakharov’s fearless personal commitment in upholding the     fundamental principles for peace between men is a powerful     inspiration for all true work for peace. Uncompromisingly and     with unflagging strength Sakharov has fought against the abuse     of power and all forms of violation of human dignity, and he     has fought no less courageously for the idea of government     based on the rule of law.      In a convincing manner Sakharov has emphasised that Man’s     inviolable rights provide the only safe foundation for genuine     and enduring international cooperation.      In this way, in a particularly effective manner, working under     difficult conditions, he has enhanced respect for the values     that rally all true peacelovers.” We were repeatedly told during the great   war that raged between 1940 and 1945 that this war was being   fought in order to safeguard the human rights of future   generations. Those who fought for this noble ideal, and the many   millions who gave their lives to achieve it, won the war on the   field of battle; but their great goal, the enduring establishment   of human dignity, was not achieved.                During the post-war years the United                Nations has worked energetically and untiringly to draw up and                gain universal acceptance for a global declaration and two conventions                on fundamental human rights. It has done so in the conviction that                these rights and freedoms are absolute imperatives for the maintenance                of lasting peace in the world. Most countries have accepted this                line of thought.    And yet today – despite all the sacrifices and efforts that have   been made – in every part of the world there are millions of   people who cannot be said to enjoy the most elementary human   rights; there are even regions where people previously enjoyed   these rights, and where, after the conclusion of the last war,   they forfeited them.    Réne Cassin, the architect of the global declaration and   one-time Peace Prize laureate, is fully aware of this. He has the   following comment to make on the present situation: “The declaration sets up an ideal for us to follow, and it     lays down guidelines for our actions.      Yet a glance at the world of today is sufficient to show that     we still have a long way to go before we can achieve this     ideal. Not a single country, even the most advanced, can pride     itself on fulfilling all the articles of the declaration.      We witness violations of the right to live. Murder and massacre     are allowed to pass unpunished. Women are exploited, there is     widespread famine, contempt for freedom of conscience and     freedom of speech, widespread racial discrimination – all these     evils are far too widespread to be overlooked.” Yet this tragic situation must not lead to   resignation. On the contrary, it is a challenge to all   responsible people, irrespective of national boundaries, to   intensify their struggle to establish respect for human dignity   and to rally around the courageous individuals who refuse to bow   their necks to the yoke.                This year’s prizewinner, Andrei Sakharov, was born in Moscow in                1921. He studied physics at the University of Moscow, and attracted                considerable attention at an early age with the publication of a                number of scientific treatises.    During the years from 1948 to 1968 Sakharov worked at an   institute for nuclear research, secret as a member of a team of   scientists engaged in the development of nuclear arms.    Sakharov himself emphasises that his own contribution to the work   of this team of scientists was not directed solely to military   ends, but aimed as well at the harnessing of nuclear power for   other purposes, e.g. in industry and in the production of   energy.    Although the Soviet Union in 1949, in common with the United   States of America, had produced her own atom bomb, nevertheless   the United States was far more advanced than the USSR in nuclear   technology. Sakharov was of the opinion that, in the interests of   peace, it was important to narrow this lead, in order to   establish a balance in the arms race capable of deterring both   parties from initiating a war.    At the age of thirty-two Sakharov was elected to the Russian   Academy of Science, of which he was the youngest member. For his   scientific work on behalf of his country he has twice been   awarded the Order of Lenin, on one occasion the Stalin Prize, and   on three separate occasions he has been nominated a Hero of   Socialist Labour.    In 1968, however, a significant change occurred in his status and   way of life. He was removed from his research post and allocated   to work in the Physics Institute of the Academy of Science.    This change in Sakharov’s circumstances and standing was a direct   result of a change in his way of thinking, and his frank   admission of this.    He describes this in his book “Sakharov Speaks”: “Beginning in 1957 (not without the influence of statements     on this subject made throughout the world by such people as     Albert Schweitzer, Linus     Pauling, and others) I felt myself responsible for the     problem of radioactive contamination from nuclear     explosions.” Sakharov made no secret of the fact that he   had arrived at these conclusions; in fact, he expressed himself   frankly to the authorities in letters, in which he set forth his   ideas on the situation. He hoped that this might provide a basis   for a free and open exchange of opinion, but in this he was   profoundly disappointed.    In one important respect, however, Sakharov believes that his   views have had some effect. This was when the USA and the Soviet   Union completed an agreement in 1963 on a ban on nuclear tests in   the atmosphere, in space, and in the ocean.    In 1968 Sakharov issued his famous “Manifesto on progress,   co-existence, and intellectual freedom”. Sakharov’s “Manifesto”   is not based only on conditions in his own country; it is written   from a global point of view and constitutes an earnest appeal for   peace to responsible men and women in every country.    The principal problem with which he deals here is the threat of   the total annihilation of our civilisation which would result   from a nuclear war. He maintains that this danger can only be   averted by means of worldwide cooperation transcending national   and ideological boundaries.    In this connection he is particularly concerned with close   contacts between the USA and the Soviet Union. It is his belief   that peaceful co-existence between these two super powers could   be achieved if some measure of approximation were to take place   between the political systems of these two states.    Sakharov believes that this form of cooperation offers the only   alternative to a nuclear war which he describes as collective   suicide.    As far as his own country’s contribution to this convergence is   concerned, he emphasises reforms such as democratisation,   debureaucratisation, demilitarisation, and social and scientific   progress.    In close cooperation between these two super powers Sakharov also   envisages a possibility for a tremendous joint approach to a   solution of world hunger, overpopulation, and pollution.    In his opinion, too, a substantial aid programme might provide a   lasting foundation for a harmonious social and economic   development of the third world.    The wholesale contributions made by the industrial countries   would, Sakharov believes, involve a considerable reduction in the   amount of money spent by these countries on armaments.    As we all know, these are ideas that have been repeatedly debated   in the United Nations. The philosophy at the back of this line of   argument has, inter alia, found expression in the appeal   which the United Nations made in 1970 in rich member-countries   allocate one per cent of their gross national product for aid to   the developing countries.    Sakharov’s “Manifesto”, which caused such a stir in large parts   of the world, was the first publication in which he gave a   cohesive presentation of his views on the conditions necessary to   a policy of détente and intellectual freedom.    In subsequent publications, such as “Sakharov Speaks” and “My   Country and the World”, his views on some of the problems he   dealt with in his “Manifesto” have undergone a change. The reason   for this, he says, is to be found in the dramatic international   development of recent years, in conversations he has had with   people from his own country and abroad, as well as in his own   widened personal experience. It is not so much the dream of the   future with which he is preoccupied, as all the dangers that   threaten, those that interpose themselves between the dream and   reality.    In assessing the ideas set forth in his “Manifesto” Sakharov   personally emphasises that at the time he wrote it, he was still   living in an isolated and highly privileged scientific milieu,   without any contact with the community outside.    This is how he describes his life at this time: “I was isolated from the people.” And in an interview he continues: “Thus, in evaluating my essay of 1968 you must understand     this and take into account the route I followed from work on     thermonuclear weapons to my concern about the results of     nuclear tests – the destruction of people, genetic     consequences, and all these things.      My life has been such that I began by confronting global     problems and only later on more concrete, personal, and human     ones.” It was his intimate contact with the daily   life of fellow human beings and his concern that compelled him to   commit himself to an intense struggle to find a solution for   problems which he indicated openly in letters written to the   authorities, and for which he demanded reforms.    In an attempt to submit his proposals to a wider public, Sakharov   founded the “Committee for Human Rights” in 1970, together with   some friends and colleagues.                The aim of this committee was to work, within the framework of the                law, to institute constructive reforms for the promotion of human                rights, in accordance with the humanist principles formulated in                the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights of 1948.    Sakharov maintained that they should strive to achieve the   following chief aims: the abolition of secret trials; a new press   law ensuring that people would have full information; reforms in   the prison system; the amnesty of political prisoners; the   abolition of the death penalty; open frontiers; and a ban on the   use of psychiatric institutes for political ends.    It must be gratifying for Sakharov to know that his ideas on the   conditions necessary for peace and détente have found an   echo in the “Agreement on Security and Cooperation in Europe”,   which was signed on August 1 this year by thirty-five different   nations in Helsinki.    Section VII of the Helsinki Agreement states: “The participating States will respect human rights and     fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought,     conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as     to race, sex, language or religion.” It goes on to state: “They will promote and encourage the effective exercise of     civil, political, economic, social, cultural and other rights     and freedoms all of which derive from the inherent dignity of     the human person and are essential for his free and full     development.” It is an historic event that the leading   states of the world should have established in this document that   human rights are an essential factor in détente between   nations.    No state and no single politician can suppress or evade the moral   and political obligations that these Articles impose by taking   refuge in formalistic arguments couched in terms of international   law. To do so would be a betrayal of mankind and of peace.    Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov has shown that he is prepared to bear   his share of the burden.    In the words of the Nobel Committee: “Andrei Sakharov’s great contribution to peace is this, that     he has fought in a particularly effective manner and under     highly difficult conditions, in the greatest spirit of     self-sacrifice, to obtain respect for these values that the     Helsinki Agreement here declares to be its object.” Sakharov’s struggle for human rights, for   disarmament, and for cooperation between all nations has peace as   its final goal. For his endeavours to improve the lot of people   in every country we pay our tribute to him here today in awarding   him the Nobel Peace Prize for 1975.    The Nobel Committee deeply deplores the fact that Andrei Sakharov   has been prevented from being present here today in person to   receive the Peace Prize.    This is a fate he shares with the man who, forty years ago in   1935, was awarded the Peace Prize. His name was Carl von   Ossietzky.    The title page of Sakharov’s celebrated “Manifesto” of 1968   carries these words of Goethe as its motto: “Only the man who has to fight for them daily deserves     freedom and life.” Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov has in truth   fulfilled Goethe’s conditions for possessing both freedom and   life."
"49","1976","Betty Williams, Mairead Corrigan","    Translation Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:    On August 10, 1976, a remarkable incident occurred in one of the   streets of Belfast in Northern Ireland. A man, in an attempted   getaway, comes tearing down the street in his car, trying to   shake off his pursuers. Suddenly a shot rings out, and with a   mortally wounded driver slumped over the steering-wheel, the   vehicle swerves into a fence, knocking down a mother and her   three children. The mother, though badly injured, survived, while   her three children were killed on the spot.    Surely this incident was not so remarkable? No, unfortunately, it   was not. Wherever war stalks the land, and terror and violence   erupt, the killing of innocent children is in no way remarkable.   Incidents of this kind are merely a logical result of the   mindless brutality of war. We have seen and heard this so often   that we are in danger of forfeiting the ability to react in   horror. Worse still, every single act of violence merely nurtures   hatred, fostering in turn more and more violence.    The event in Belfast on that August day in 1976, however, gave   rise to something entirely different, and it is for this reason   that it was so remarkable.    In the area where the three children were killed lived a   housewife: she heard the thud as the car crashed into the fence,   and as she hurried to the spot she took in the whole horror of   the scene. At that moment something happened in that woman’s   mind: it was like the bursting of a dam.    What she saw shocked her profoundly; but even more, she was   overwhelmed with a passionate desire to make a stand against all   violence and terror. Now, for heaven’s sake, something must be   done! There was no time for deliberation and planning: she never   even thought of anything like that, but acted intuitively, as her   heart dictated. She started to go from door to door in the actual   street where the tragedy had occurred. The cup of horrors had now   run over: the time had come when the ordinary man and woman must   rise in protest against this senseless use of violence. It was no   longer a question of political attitudes or religious   convictions. There was only one remedy: the people themselves   must cry halt. Radio and television showed a certain amount of   interest in the housewife’s campaign, and she was given an   opportunity of making a broadcast appeal to the Irish people not   to capitulate to terror. Peace must not be allowed to sit idly on   the touchlines: now, for once, peace must march!    Her appeal found a ready response. More and more people rallied   to her call. One of the first to do so was an aunt of the three   children, and these two women now marched boldly out into the   no-man’s land of war, proclaiming their simple, heartening   message of reconciliation. From these small beginnings sprang   what today, the world over, is known as the Peace Movement of   Northern Ireland.    Today, that housewife and the aunt of those three children are   with us, and today these two, Betty Williams and Mairead   Corrigan, have come to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for   1976.    One of the main reasons why the women proved so successful in   their campaign is that on both sides of the frontline a desperate   yearning for peace had taken root. What Betty Williams and   Mairead Corrigan said re-echoed the thoughts of tens of   thousands, and in this way they became the spokesmen of the   desire for a commonsense approach that filled the average man and   woman – despite their feeling of helplessness in the face of   violence.    But more than that, their courageous action cast a fresh light on   the very essence of the grievous conflict that racked Northern   Ireland. More clearly than ever before it appeared in its true   light as a disease that ravaged the whole nation. People’s minds   had somehow got stuck in a groove: sound common sense could no   longer get a hearing. The spirit that was now spread abroad was   what the Norwegian poet Bjornstjerne Bjornson called “passions’   crying need”.    The conflict in Northern Ireland springs from noxious roots   deeply embedded in history. Countless attempts have been made to   resolve it, so far in vain. Those who endeavoured to speak in the   name of moderation appeared to speak to deaf ears. A mood of   hopeless resignation prevailed: terror and violence became part   and parcel of people’s everyday lives. Barricades were thrown up   in the streets. Sharp boundary lines divided one part of a town   from another. An ominous silence developed between neighbours;   even children were trained and committed to the use of violence.   Society was at war with itself, and even though reason declared   that the use of arms could never bring about a lasting peace, no   one was capable of suggesting a viable alternative.    There is something unreal about the turmoil in Northern Ireland,   something nightmarish. A peaceful street is suddenly transformed   into a theatre of war, and the victims of that war are your own   friends and neighbours. Even schoolchildren are fair game. In   homes, in shops, in offices, and in pubs and factories the very   air is poisoned with suspicion and hatred. No struggle can be   more bitter than one fought between people who in reality are so   close to one another. This in truth is what might be described as   passions’ crying need.    It was in a situation of this kind that Betty Williams and   Mairead Corrigan stood forth; and with unerring instinct they   started at the “wrong end” – not at the top, among the shrewd   heads that were filled with so much political insight – no, they   approached the ordinary men and women of every day, with a clear   and simple message: we must put an end to the use of violence and   to acts of terrorism. We must build our future on peace and   cooperation. War is only senseless and evil, incapable of solving   any problem.    It would be simple to maintain that this is all self-evident and   that anyone could say this in despair at the meaningless   sufferings of war. Yes, but in reality the solution of each and   every human conflict is to be found in the simple and obvious   action of someone taking the first steps on the road to   reconciliation and cooperation.    This, at any rate, is what happened in Northern Ireland. Men and   women from both camps came together and marched in demonstrations   in support of the peace for which they all longed. Barbed-wire   barriers were removed; barricades were torn down, the ominous   silence was broken. Neighbours and countrymen shook hands and   started to talk together, to live together, and to build   together. The reaction to the campaign initiated by Betty   Williams and Mairead Corrigan was wholesome and genuinely human.   It provided a proof of the inspiration that will flow precisely   from the simple, the true, and the genuine – which, of course, is   also so obviously right.    The Peace Prize winner Andrei   Sakharov once said that in a great many situations we need to   formulate ideal goals, even though at any given moment it is   impossible to envisage the road that leads to that goal. Without   such ideals, too, there can be no hope, and we shall be fumbling   in the dark, in a blind alley that offers no hope.    These words of Sakharov’s are true as well of Betty Williams and   Mairead Corrigan. They never claimed that they were in a position   to indicate the only royal road that would lead to their goal;   but they were in no doubt about the first step that must be taken   along this road. There would have to be an end to guerilla   warfare and acts of violence; and it should be possible to do   this if people would only rise up in protest against the war and   join hands in the cause of peace. That would be the first   step.    In actual fact, in so doing they struck a devastating blow at the   very basis of guerilla warfare, since it goes without saying   that, if violence were rejected by the great bulk of the   population, guerilla activities would automatically no longer   prove viable.    And it is precisely here that the dynamic force of the Northern   Irish Peace Movement is to be found: what it declares – and   proves in action – is that the people of Northern Ireland, who   have lived in a state of confrontation for decades, are now tired   of all this. The desire for peace has been given fresh impetus;   more and more people realise that terror can never provide an   answer to social injustice, and act accordingly.    That so many people in Northern Ireland have recognised this, and   have adjusted their lives in conformity with this, is what we all   hope may prove to be the first dawn of a new day bringing lasting   peace to the sorely tried people of Ulster.    The road leading to lasting peace may yet prove long and arduous,   and there are almost certainly a great many people who still   doubt whether the Peace Movement can in the long run achieve   anything. Admittedly, all too often champions of non-violence   have been shouted down, ridiculed, and labelled utopians. The   Peace Movement of Northern Ireland must be prepared to face such   charges, and have no doubt already had to do so.    One incontrovertible fact remains: they took the first courageous   step along the road to peace. They did so in the name of humanity   and love of their neighbour: someone had to start   forgiving.    Love of one’s neighbour is one of the foundation stones of the   humanism on which our western civilisation is built. But it is   vital that we should have the courage to sustain this love of our   neighbour in the very circumstances when the pressure to abandon   it is at its greatest – otherwise it is of little worth. This is   why it is so important that it should shine forth when hatred and   revenge threaten to dominate.    This spirit of human brotherhood is also the foundation for the   human rights which we believe are a part of the concept of peace.   We must ensure that each and every one of us enjoys the right to   a life of human dignity. The future of the world depends on our   success in fostering increased respect for this right.    I do not know whether Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan were   aware of the consequences when they started their peace movement;   but I am quite sure that they have sensed how these forces have   gathered strength around them during the time that ensued. They   unleashed a fervent desire and hope for peace that was latent in   so many minds, and out of this grew a peace movement, almost   before they themselves realised it. With poignant simplicity and   confidence they have accepted responsibility for something that   they started; and they have done this with the close cooperation   and excellent assistance of a great many efficient   fellow-sympathisers.    No one knows today whether this organised movement will ever   achieve its goals; but its leaders have every right to believe   and hope and work for the achievement of these goals. In Northern   Ireland as well as elsewhere in the world there are a great many   people who share their hope and belief. Betty Williams and   Mairead Corrigan have shown us what ordinary people can do to   promote the cause of peace. They have taught us that the peace   for which we strive is something that has to be won within and   through the individual human being. This is the message to which   they have given renewed force through their activities.    Alfred Nobel was constantly concerned with this. Possessed as he   was with the questing mind of the inventor, he developed a great   many theories on the question of how to secure peace. In 1891 he   wrote to a friend that in many critical situations success in   achieving a pause in the use of violence would prove decisive.   This would provide an opportunity of working still further on   this basis. The important thing was to mobilise good will in each   of the opposed camps. A basis existed for friendship for all   people, and the important thing was merely to discover this   basis.    It was with this in mind that he stipulated in his will and   testament that his Peace Prize should be awarded to those who had   done most to promote the cause of the brotherhood of man.    There are some, no doubt, who will say that this is much too   naive in the brutal world familiar to us today. To this Alfred   Nobel would probably have said: Give me a single example of   progress for mankind which has not been derided by sceptics as   utopian and escapist!    The two women who share the Peace Prize for 1976 have refused to   bow to bleak scepticism: they simply acted. They never heeded the   difficulty of their task: they merely tackled it because they   were so convinced that this precisely was what was needed. There   was no talk here of ingenious theories, of shrewd diplomacy or   pompous declarations. No, their contribution was a far better   one: a courageous, unselfish act that proved an inspiration to   thousands, that lit a light in the darkness, and that gave fresh   hope to people who believed that all hope was gone.    We admire Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan for tackling so   fearlessly the perilous task of leading the way into no-man’s   land, in the cause of peace and reconciliation. It is for this   deed that the Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to honour   them. What they have done is an example to the world. Their   action harmonised with what is the very basis of our   civilisation, and it sprang from a vision which shines like a   bright torch into the future. What they have built – to quote   once again Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson – is: “A rainbow bridge of prayer above earth’s     fretful air,     a beacon light for man,     ablaze with Christ’s belief that love would conquer     grief;     for thus His promise ran.”"
"50","1977","Amnesty International","    Translation Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, This year the Norwegian Nobel Committee is   awarding two Peace Prizes, one to the initiators of the Northern Ireland Peace   Movement and one to the organisation Amnesty   International. These two movements have one thing in   common: they have sprung spontaneously from the individual’s deep   and firmly rooted conviction that the ordinary man and woman is   capable of making a meaningful contribution to peace. This is remarkable in an age when we live   with the desperate pressure of the conviction that only the   military power blocs equipped with nuclear arms are in a position   to decide, for one and all of us, the question of war or   peace. The two prizewinners have given a clear and   simple No to violence, torture, and terrorism, and an equally   clear and unreserved Yes to the defence of human dignity and   human rights. This is a philosophy and an attitude in   harmony with the creed expressed by the Norwegian poet Nordahl   Grieg: In brutal strife     your sword and shield shall be     belief in life     and human dignity. The two awards today clearly emphasise the   Nobel Committee’s interpretation of the peace concept. They   establish the fact that peace is not merely abstinence from war,   but in addition respect for the human rights proclaimed in the   Helsinki Agreement of 1975; freedom of thought, conscience,   religion or faith are essential prerequisites for peace. The Peace Movement in Northern Ireland   champions the right of the individual to live a life free from   fear, from violence and acts of terrorism, in other words   “external” peace. Amnesty International fights for man’s   right to freedom of conscience, in other words, to a life in   “internal” peace. Taken together, these two peace movements   represent an aim which ordinary mortals associate with the dream   of peace. Amnesty International, founded in London in   1961 by the English lawyer Peter Benenson, can today look back on   sixteen years of activity. It was a mere coincidence that led to the   establishment of this organisation, which today is global in its   scope, comprising some 100,000 members and some 2,000 groups in   33 different countries. Sitting in the compartment of a train in   London, one day in 1960, Peter Benenson happened to read in the   papers of two Portuguese students who had been sentenced to long   terms of imprisonment for making critical remarks on Salazar’s   regime. Peter Benenson was not only profoundly   shocked, he decided then and there that he would try to help the   two young men who had been the victims of this violation of   justice. His impulsive reaction to the sentence   passed on these two may have sprung from an interpretation of the   concept of freedom which says that: “Freedom merely for adherents   of a government, or of one party, is no freedom; freedom will   also mean freedom as well for those who hold different   views.” Together with a number of others who shared   his views Benenson organised, in the years that followed, the   movement which is known today as the prisoners’ friend, Amnesty   International. The great and ambitious goal of this organization   is to contribute to the implementation, in every country, of the   principles of the Declaration of Human Rights. It is now almost thirty years since this   Declaration was adopted by the United Nations. A great many   high-minded people have striven to put its ideals into practice;   nevertheless, in recent times we have witnessed an increasing use   of brute force, of violence on an international plane, of torture   and terrorism. A great many people have been seized with a   paralysing sense of horror and impotence. Faced with this   situation, Amnesty, so far from shrinking from its task, has   stepped up its efforts to ensure that governments in all   countries should feel morally obliged to abide by the United   Nations’ Declaration of Human Rights. A number of nations maintained during the   Belgrade Conference that for one country to call attention to a   violation of human rights in another country constituted   interference in the internal affairs of that country. I cannot believe that a ruse of this nature   aimed at glossing over injustices perpetrated in one’s own   country will be countenanced by international opinion today. On   the contrary, the view is now gaining ground that no state can   lay claim to absolute national sovereignty where human rights   that are universally recognised are involved. These rights are   man’s common property, and no power constellation, no dictator,   is entitled to deprive us of them. The primary aim of Amnesty International is   to work to secure the release of people imprisoned for their   opinions who have made no use of violence or incited others to do   so. These prisoners are called “prisoners of conscience”. The demand for their release only applies   to this category of prisoner; as far as all prisoners are   concerned, Amnesty International maintains as a general principle   that they must be accorded legal defence and that their trials   should be conducted openly. Furthermore, all persons in custody,   both during the process of interrogation and the carrying out of   their sentence, must be guaranteed humane treatment.. As far as the position of prisoners of   conscience was concerned, it was first and foremost Articles 18   and 19 that needed to be emphasised. These two Articles establish everyone’s   right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion, and   speech. In recent years, too, Amnesty International   has campaigned rigorously for compliance with Articles 5 and 9,   which maintain that no prisoner must be subjected to torture or   cruel and humiliating treatment, and no one must be subject to   arbitrary arrest, imprisonment, or banishment. Finally, the movement is conducting a   vigorous campaign against the use of capital punishment. In its efforts to implement this programme,   Amnesty International has based its work on three irrevocable   principles: the organisation must at all times be neutral,   impartial, and independent. Neutrality means that Amnesty International   is to work just as energetically for every single prisoner of   conscience, no matter what political or religious views the   prisoner may hold. This does not necessarily imply that the   organisation shares the views of the prisoner, but that it   maintains his right, under any regime, to give expression to his   opinions. Amnesty International is committed to   political and geographical impartiality; its eyes are open to   coercion and injustice, wherever in the world these evils appear,   in the East or the West or in the Third World. In reviewing a   case it must be blind neither on the right eye nor on the   left. This involves a difficult balancing feat in   an age in which distortion and confusion of concepts often   appears to have become a political weapon. But unswerving   impartiality is a sine qua non if Amnesty International is to   maintain its credibility and justify its existence. The third principle of the organisation,   independence, means that it may not base its activities on   donations that might curtail its freedom or its activities. Amnesty International is today financed   almost exclusively by contributions from its national   sections. What are Amnesty’s chances of success in   promoting its programme? The organisation has refrained from   intervening in the domestic or foreign policy of its “own”   government; to avoid involvement in internal political strife an   Amnesty group never “adopts” prisoners from its own country. Nor does Amnesty organise demonstrations in   support of its demands. Despite this, it succeeds in making its   views known. This is due not least to the revealing reports   published regularly by Amnesty on prison conditions and torture   in various countries. It is clear that the organisation’s future   will to a large extent depend on its ability to reach the ear of   a favourable, fair-minded world opinion. If it succeeds in doing   this, the most important battle for human rights will have been   won. In its organisational form and working   methods Amnesty differs from other movements. It is based on   relatively small groups, so-called “adoption groups”, which   “adopt” prisoners from countries with a different political   background. The various groups have close links with   the head office in London, where the great task of tracing,   helping, and securing the release of prisoners incarcerated for   reasons of conscience is carried on. The “adoption groups” base   their work for prisoners on a comprehensive body of information   comprising the prisoners’ situation, the state of justice in the   country concerned, and the possibility of despatching observers   to investigate the prisoner’s case and his situation. One of the main preoccupations of Amnesty   International is the constant efforts being made to ensure the   negotiation of international agreements capable of securing the   human rights of prisoners, and to protect them against physical   and mental torture. The United Nations have admittedly long   since adopted minimum standards for prisons, but the great   question is whether these are practised. In order to secure implementation of its   demands that the Declaration of Human Rights should be adhered to   by member nations of the UNO, Amnesty has mooted the idea of a   special High Commissioner for Human Rights. Norway is one of the   member countries supporting this proposal. In the light of the fact that thirty-five   nations have this year foregathered in Belgrade for protracted   negotiations, on the very subject of following up the promises   embodied in the Helsinki Agreement to promote human rights, it is   tragic to observe that this year, too, the UNO has failed to   implement the proposal for establishing a High Commissioner. Still more deplorable is the fact that the   very countries in which these rights are today so monstrously   trampled underfoot should have opposed this proposal – and that   they should be numerous enough to succeed. What, one might ask,   are the results of Amnesty International’s activities during   these last sixteen years? How many prisoners, for example, have   been released as a result of Amnesty’s efforts? Perhaps the best   answer is provided by a single set of statistics covering the   period 1972 to 1975, which reveals that of the approximately   6,000 prisoners for whom Amnesty was working at that time 3,000   were released. A great many factors, quite apart from Amnesty,   may well have contributed to this result; nevertheless, these   figures provide some indication of the scope of the work. I do not consider it so important, however,   to submit exact statistics. Nor is it likely that this is   possible. It is still more important to consider Amnesty   International’s worldwide activities as an integral part in the   incessant pressure exerted by all good forces on governments and   on the United Nations   Organisation, representing a coordinated and necessary effort   to achieve an international society founded on justice. The many thousands of individuals the world   over, working in the “adoption groups”, develop, moreover, a   close personal relationship to the prisoners they have “adopted”.   It must be a great source of joy to be able in practice to assist   an individual prisoner and his family, by sending letters and   showing solicitude in so many ways. Likewise, it must be a source of infinite   comfort to the individual prisoner to feel that he has not been   forgotten by the outside world, that someone is working to   achieve his release, a release, maybe, from the most wretched   dungeon. Amnesty has shone a torch of hope into his   cell, maybe precisely when its inmate is sunk in the depths of   despair and degradation. The prisoner derives comfort and strength   from the knowledge that he is “not alone in his suffering”. He   can shed his fear of the grim reality of the saying that “a   person who has been forgotten is lost”. In deciding to honour Amnesty International   with the Nobel Peace Prize in the year 1977 – the year of   “prisoners of conscience” – the Nobel Committee does so in the   conviction that the defence of human dignity against torture,   violence, and degradation constitutes a very real contribution to   the peace of this world. In a word, it may be said of Amnesty   International’s activity today that this organisation has given a   human answer to the appeal of the Norwegian poet Arnulf   Øverland: Don’t suffer too lightly, oh, never more     Injustice and wrongs that another bore. But this work to protect human dignity is   not a sacrifice we make for others: it is important that all of   us should understand that in this age we must act accordingly in   recognition of the earnest appeal contained in Aleksandr   Solzhenitsyn‘s words: You’re defending yourself –     Your future itself is at stake."
"51","1978","Anwar al-Sadat, Menachem Begin","    Translation Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:    The   Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded the Peace Prize for   1978 to Anwar al-Sadat, President of Egypt, and Menachem Begin,   Prime Minister of Israel, for their contribution to the two frame   agreements on peace in the Middle East, and on peace between   Egypt and Israel, which were signed at Camp David on September   17, 1978.    Never previously in the history of the Peace Prize, stretching   back over a period of almost eighty years, have we witnessed an   award ceremony such as this in King Haukon V’s medieval castle of   Akershus, with its memories of far-off times of war and unrest in   the chronicles of our land.    Never has the Nobel Committee considered it apposite to award the   Peace Prize to statesmen from the troubled and sadly devastated   Middle East.    Never has the Prize been closely associated with agreements such   as the two Camp David agreements, which provide the basis for the   award to the two statesmen on whose shoulders such grave   responsibilities have fallen.    Never has the Peace Prize expressed a greater or more audacious   hope – a hope of peace for the people of Egypt, for the people of   Israel, and for all the peoples of the strife-torn and   war-ravaged Middle East.    The award of the Prize to the President of Egypt, Anwar al-Sadat,   and the Prime Minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, is moreover   historical in the wider sense, in that we only know of one   previous peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. This, as   Israeli scholars have revealed, took place some 3,000 years ago;   it was the peace concluded between King David’s son, wise King   Solomon, and the Egyptian Pharaoh.    It was in this part of the world that the cradle of our   civilisation was to be found, more than 6,000 years ago. Here,   communities with a high standard of culture, which were to   exercise a profound influence on the development of human society   in other parts of the world, grew up and flourished. Today, every   single schoolchild knows from his or her history books that it   was here that our written history first began; and adherents of   three historically related religions – Islam, Judaism and   Christianity have turned their gaze with unflagging devotion to   that part of the world from which their religion sprang.    The Middle East, situated as it is at the junction of Asia,   Europe, and Africa, has been not only a meeting-place for   cultures, but also a battleground for economic interests and   foreign conquerors. Again and again cultural splendour and   material prosperity have been rudely interrupted by wars, foreign   domination, and internal schism.    In our own time the struggle of the Arabs to free themselves from   alien domination was crowned with success when Egypt shook off   the British yoke. In this struggle for national liberation Anwar   al-Sadat played a leading part.    At the same time the national movement sprang up in the little   Jewish communities that for two thousand years had been scattered   around in various countries all over the world but holding fast   at all times to memories and hopes of their historical homeland.   The anti-Semitism which culminated with Hitler’s mass slaughter   of Europe’s Jews drove them to seek security and rebirth in their   own country of Israel. With the active participation of the   United Nations,   the state of Israel was established in 1948. The state and nation   of Israel had now become a political and human fact.    The establishment of an Israeli state ushered in a new conflict   throughout the Middle East. In the course of the last thirty   years this dispute between the Jews and Arabs has unleashed four   wars, which have not only caused tremendous material damage but   also exacerbated hostility between them.    Side by side with war and destruction, however, the constructive   forces of peace, too, have hewn out a path for themselves.    Over the years a great deal of goodwill has been harnessed to   breach the psychological wall which has all too long constituted   a bar to understanding and human contact between the Arab states   and the Israelis. This is a wall of frightening dimensions, which   President Anwar al-Sadat once compared to the Great Barrier Reef   off the coast of Australia.    Two men who played a vital role in paving the way for this peace   deserve to be mentioned: former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the President of the   United States, Jimmy Carter.    Henry Kissinger’s peace mission in the Middle East was launched   immediately after the conclusion of the fourth war between Israel   on the one hand and Egypt and Syria on the other.    We recall his energetic attempts to get the belligerent parties   in the so-called Jom Kippur War to come together for a peace   conference in Geneva.    The conference did in fact materialise, in December 1973, and   resulted in agreement between Egypt and Israel on a number of   important points, such as the exchange of prisoners, the   withdrawal of troops to delimited zones, security guarantees, and   other measures aimed at consolidating the truce, and with a peace   agreement as a long-term goal.    Henry Kissinger’s work in promoting the agreements concluded   between the belligerents after the Jom Kippur War in 1973   provided the basis for President Jimmy Carter’s move in   organising the meeting at Camp David in 1978.    The dramatic highlight in the efforts to arrive at a peaceful   settlement was provided by President Anwar al-Sadat’s courageous   journey to Jerusalem on November 19, 1977.    With his bold visit to the Israeli parliament, Knesset, President   Sadat cut the Gordian knot at a single stroke.    The way was now open for the meetings at Camp David, where the   first constructive steps were taken in the form of two agreements   of fundamental importance:   The frame agreement for peace in the Middle East and;   The frame agreement for concluding peace between Egypt and   Israel.    It is for their work in laying a foundation for future peace   between these two one-time enemy countries that the President of   Egypt, Anwar al-Sadat, and the Prime Minister of Israel, Menachem   Begin, have been honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize for   1978.    The four wars in the Middle East merely foreshadowed fresh   conflicts, new material destruction, and human tragedy.    Amid this darkness we glimpsed a sudden light, and a victory is   won without a war, as President Sadat sets off on his journey to   “the City of Peace”, as he called Jerusalem in his historic   speech in the Knesset.    His outstretched hand and offer of peace, friendship, and   cooperation sets the spirit of the frame agreement, pointing the   way to realities in a final peace agreement based on normal   diplomatic, economic, and cultural links.    The masterbuilder responsible for the bridge that had to be built   between Egypt and Israel in order that these two one-time enemy   nations should have any opportunity of coming together to frame   an agreement, was the president of the USA, Jimmy Carter.    President Sadat has described the importance of this vital step   in the work of pioneering a peace in the following words: “Jimmy   Carter was the Unknown Soldier”.    With regard to the second frame agreement from Camp David for   peace in the Middle East important and apparently time-consuming   negotiations on the West Bank, Gaza, and the Golan Heights still   remain to be completed.    The future alone can provide an answer to these questions.   Meanwhile, the world must be allowed to share in the happiness of   the people of Egypt and Israel, that, for the first time since   the re-establishrment of the state of Israel in 1948, an   agreement has successfully been reached which, on a long-term   basis, provides a genuine opportunity for peace in an area over   which the shadow of war had hovered so long.    Without speculating on conflicting theories on the actual driving   forces at work in history, there is surely general agreement that   two men, the president of Egypt, Anwar al-Sadat, and the prime   minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, have played key roles in the   quest for peace between two former enemies which today is such a   source of gratification to true friends of peace the world   over.    These two men have a great deal in common: they were born in a   century marked by global wars and gigantic revolutions, of racial   problems and foreign domination.    Both of them have been active in the mainstream of history, in   its political and social conflicts. From their earliest years   they have identified themselves with the fate of their countries,   they have fought and suffered, in prison and in labour camp, for   the sovereignty of their native land and for the freedom of   man.    Their lives and paths have crossed in an act of peace that may   well usher in a new era, a future of material renewal and peace,   not only for their two respective countries, but for the entire   Middle East.    President Anwar al-Sadat was born on December 25, 1918. He spent   the early years of childhood in the little village of Mit   Abul-Kum on the banks of the Nile. His memoirs are deeply imbued   with his intense feeling of kinship with the earth and the life   of the village in which he was born.    His childhood is summed up in one lyrical phrase: “Everything I   experienced in Mit Abul-Kum made me happy”. This included his   sense of oneness with Nature, his participation in the collective   work of the peasants, and not least, life in a family which   included a paternal grandmother who, though unlettered, was noted   for her wisdom.    Today, whenever he speaks of his grandmother, President Sadat   does so with such warmth and devotion that we immediately sense   how love for her still lives on in his heart.    He still recalls her simple words: “Nothing is of such great   importance as the fact that you are a child of this earth. The   earth can never die – in it lies the mystery of creation.”    President Sadat defines his faith thus: “I shall never go astray,   because I know with such certainty that I have my roots in the   village, deep down in the soil from which I, like the trees and   other growing things, have sprung.”    Throughout his turbulent life Sadat has felt a need for the inner   harmony and balance which affinity with the soil has given   him.    During his childhood and adolescent years Egypt was under British   domination.    Early on Sadat determined to fight for the independence of his   country. For this reason he chose the profession of army officer,   and together with Gamal Abdel Nasser, a friend from his school   days, he founded in 1939, at the age of 21, a secret group of   officers whose aim it was to free Egypt from foreign rule. In the   course of this struggle he was arrested in 1942 and stripped of   his officer’s rank. After a successful escape from prison, he   remained in hiding until he was arrested in 1946 and sentenced to   three years’ imprisonment.    In 1950 he was reinstated in the Army. In 1952 Sadat was one of   the leading spirits in the Egyptian revolution which led to the   fall of King Farouk.    In 1969 he was appointed Vice-Presidernt of Egypt by President   Nasser, and on Nasser’s death in 1970 he was elected President of   Egypt.    President Sadat has piloted his country through a difficult   period, involving war as well as far-reaching economic   problems.    It is to President Sadat’s credit that he realised that the   solution to important social and economic problems in his own   country demanded too the conclusion of a peace settlement with   Israel.    All in all, President Sadat’s policy during all these years has   reflected a willingness to re-think old problems and courage to   break away from traditional diplomatic methods.    During the thirty preceding years, the peoples of the Middle East   have on four separate occasions been the victims of warfare, and   there seemed no prospect of peace. President Sadat’s great   contribution to peace was that he had sufficient courage and   foresight to break away from this vicious circle.    His decision to accept Prime Minister Menachem Begin’s invitation   of November 17, 1977, to attend a meeting of the Israeli   parliament on November 19 was an act of great courage, both from   a personal and from a political point of view. This was a   dramatic break with the past and a courageous step forward into a   new age.    In Jerusalem Sadat frankly submitted his demands, but in return   offered recognition of Israel as a state, as well as conciliation   and peace.    Sadat’s outstretched hand was accepted by Israel’s prime   minister, Menachem Begin, the other main protagonist in the Camp   David agreement.    The political situation into which Menachem Begin was born, in   1913, in the Polish town of Brest-Litovsk provided a   starting-point and a decisive guideline for his turbulent   career.    The impression made on him by the violent and increasing   anti-Semitism nourished in him at an early age the yearning and   the determination to return to the ancient home of the Jews in   Israel.    While studying law he joined the Jewish Youth Movement. In May   1939 he was imprisoned for participation in a demonstration in   favour of the right of the persecuted European Jews to emigrate   to Palestine. After a brief spell in prison he fled to Lithuania,   in the hope that from this country he and his family might make   their way to Palestine. The Soviet Russian occupation of   Lithuania in 1939, however, effectively prevented this. He was   arrested and sentenced to eight years’ forced labour in a   Siberian prison camp.    After the German attack on the Soviet Union he was released, in   company with thousands of other political prisoners, as the   authorities hoped in this way to be able to provide sufficient   recruits for a Polish army to be deployed in the struggle against   Nazism. Begin now joined the Polish forces which were being   trained on Soviet soil and despatched to Transjordan. In 1942 he   made his way from that country to Palestine, which at that time   was being administered as a British mandated territory.    At this time the British authorities imposed very severe   restrictions on immigration permits for Jews who during the war   were under the threat of extermination in the German gas   chambers.    Menachem Begin deployed all his energy to circumvent these   rigorous regulations. He joined the national combatant   organisation Irgun Zvai Leumi, and soon rose to be its   leader.    During the first few years Irgun collaborated with the British   authorities in the struggle against German Nazism.    However, when the British, despite systematic Nazi extermination   of the European Jews, persisted in maintaining their immigration   policy for Palestine, Irgun adopted a more obdurate line under   Begin’s leadership, demanding now not only an open door for   Jewish refugees, but also the right to the establishment of an   independent Jewish state.    From then and up to 1947 Begin and the underground movement Irgun   waged a relentless struggle against the British administration.   At one time the British authorities set a price of £30,000   on his head.    In 1947, when fighting broke out between Arabs and Jews, Irgun   was finally recognised by the Jewish authorities, and integrated   as a regular unit in the Jewish military organisation   Haganah.    When the state of Israel became a reality in 1948 Begin founded   his own political party, Herut, which was radically opposed to   the Israeli Labour Party, Mapai, led by Ben Gurion.    At the 1977 elections the Conservative alliance known as Likud   won a major political victory, and on June 21, 1977, Menachem   Begin became prime minister of Israel, and it was he who, on   behalf of the state of Israel, accepted President Sadat’s   outstretched hand.    Egypt and Israel now enjoy the prospect of an end to thirty years   of hostility interrupted merely by brief intervals of   truce.    Complex problems of international law – as well as military and   economic problems – must be solved and old suspicions and   prejudices swept aside.    It is easy to state the nature of this formidable task. But can   it be solved, can entirely new relations be created between   people in an area where for decades the shadow of war has   eclipsed all hope?    In his historic speech to the Knesset, today’s Peace Prize   laureate Anwar al-Sadat answered this question with the following   words:    “I truly tell you: we have before us today an opportunity for   peace which time will never repeat and we must seize it if we are   really serious in struggling for peace. If we weaken or fritter   away this opportunity we shall end in a new blood-bath; he who   has conspired to lose it will have the curse of humanity and   history on his head.”    On the same occasion today’s other Prize-winner, Prime Minister   Menachem Begin, expressed his own views on the potentialities of   peace:    “We believe that if we achieve peace, true peace, we shall be   able to assist one another in all realms of life, and a new era   will be opened in the Middle East: an era of flourishing and   growth, of development and progress and advancement, as in   ancient times …”    Men of good will all over the world will now follow in their   thoughts these two prize-winners in their endeavours to solve   this great task of establishing peace.    This is a wish that has been expressed in the Camp David   agreement:    “The people of the Middle East yearn for peace, so that the vast   human and natural resources of the region can be turned to the   pursuits of peace and so that this area can become a model for   coexistence and cooperation among nations.”    Today, throughout the world, we are celebrating the thirtieth   anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.    May I express the hope that this Nobel Peace Prize ceremony,   enacted in our small and wintry country, tucked away near the   Arctic Circle, may provide an enduring reminder to the world that   it was here that representatives of Egypt and Israel shook hands   as they celebrated the greatest of all victories – conciliation   and lasting peace based on respect for human rights and human   dignity."
"52","1979","Mother Teresa","    Translation Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,    The Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded the Peace Prize for   1979 to Mother Teresa. The year 1979 has not been a year of peace:   disputes and conflicts between nations, peoples, and ideologies   have been conducted with all the accompanying extremes of   inhumanity and cruelty. We have witnessed wars, the unrestrained   use of violence, we have witnessed fanaticism hand in hand with   cynicism, we have witnessed contempt for human life and   dignity. We are faced with new and overwhelming   floods of refugees. Not without reason the word genocide has been   on many lips. In many countries completely innocent people have   been the victims of acts of terror. In this year, moreover, we   recall the way in which an entire ethnic group was virtually   exterminated in Europe only a generation ago. The Holocaust film   series has shaken us, not only as an evil memory from our own   not-too-distant past, and as we consider the world of 1979, not   one of us can be certain that the like may not recur in the   future. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has   considered it right and appropriate, precisely in the year, in   their choice of Mother Teresa, to remind the world of the words   spoken by Fridtjof   Nansen: “Love of one’s neighbour is realistic policy”. As a description of Mother Teresa’s life’s   work we might select the slogan that a previous Nobel Peace Prize   laureate, Albert   Schweitzer, adopted as the leitmotif for his own work:   “Veneration for life”. Over the years the Committee has frequently   awarded Nobel’s Peace Prize to statesmen, men who have carried   out their work under the conditions that obtain in our imperfect   world. In the opinion of the Committee they had played a dominant   role in bringing to an end wars that had already broken out,   seeking peaceful solutions to conflicts, and in preventing fresh   outbreaks of war. The Committee has awarded the prize to   idealists who explored avenues leading to a better world, in   which war would be meaningless or inconceivable and where   traditional statesmanship would be superfluous. The prize has been awarded to individuals   and organisations which, through international humanitarian work   and cooperation, have been able to contribute to the brotherhood   of nations that Alfred Nobel hoped that his Peace Prize would   promote. The prize has been awarded to scientists   and organisations dedicated to the task of tackling and   overcoming economic and social privation, not least hunger, which   is yet another threat to brotherhood and peace. The Committee has   awarded the Peace Prize to champions of equality and fraternity   among peoples of different race in every country and in every   part of the world. It has awarded the prize to champions of   human rights, of the individual man’s and woman’s claim to the   protection of his or her integrity, body and soul, against the   power of the State that is so often abused. There are many paths we can and must pursue   to reach our goals – brotherhood and peace. In awarding Nobel’s Peace Prize for 1979 to   Mother Teresa the Committee has posed a focal question that we   encounter along all these paths: Can any political, social, or   intellectual feat of engineering, on the international or on the   national plane, however effective and rational, however   idealistic and principled its protagonists may be, give us   anything but a house built on a foundation of sand, unless the   spirit of Mother Teresa inspires the builders and takes its   dwelling in their building? Mother Teresa was born into an Albanian   Roman Catholic family in the Yugoslavian town of Skopje. She   relates that at the age of twelve she felt a vocation to help the   poor. A few years later she listened to accounts of conditions in   Bengal, as related by missionaries, and decided there and then   that she would work as a missionary in India. At the age of   eighteen she joined the Irish Loreto order, whose sisters ran a   mission station in Calcutta. From 1929 to 1946 she taught at the   girls’ school run by the order in that city. It was in 1946 that she applied for   permission to go out and work among the poor in the slums of the   city. She felt this to be a fresh vocation, a vocation within a   vocation, as she herself has expressed it. She had a glimpse of the poverty and   squalor of the slums, of sick people who remained untended, of   lonely men and women lying down to die on the pavement, of the   thousands of orphaned children wandering around with no one to   care for them. It was among these people that she felt a   call to work, and to spend the rest of her life, in daily contact   with them. She left the sheltered world of the convent and the   fashionable girls’ school behind her. Her plea to be allowed to   go out into the slums and work there was granted. In 1948 she   received permission to change from the uniform of the Loreto   order to the customary cheap Indian sari. She started her work   after an intensive course in nursing. She was joined by a number of former pupils   and other young women. In 1948 this little local community was   recognised as a new, separate order, the Missionaries of Charity.   In addition to the customary convent vows, a fourth promise, “to   give wholehearted, free service to the very poorest”, was   added. Fifteen years later, in 1965, Mother   Teresa’s order was recognised as a papal congregation under the   protection of the Vatican. In the years that had elapsed the   Missionaries of Charity had witnessed a growth that no one could   have foreseen, and which was to continue. In time, more and more   women, Indian as well as foreign, volunteered for this service,   and were recruited into the order. It also received the support   of an auxiliary organisation consisting of male lay helpers. Its   activities include slum schools, homes for orphaned children,   mobile clinics, leprosy centres, hostels for the dying, food   kitchens, vocational training, and much else besides. In recent years the order has extended its   activities to cover twenty new countries, although the main   emphasis is still on India and the neighbouring state of   Bangladesh. To date, several million people have benefited from   the social welfare and rescue work of the order. The Norwegian Nobel Committee is delighted   to note this impressive and steadily growing scope of the work   undertaken by the order. It has not, however, attached decisive   importance to statistical information: it has not compared such   statistics with figures attributable to other organisations and   institutions. Many of these have carried out work that merits the   greatest respect. Nor has the Committee considered the   relationship between private and public activity in the work of   redressing and overcoming the physical privation and distress in   the world. The Committee has attached decisive   importance to the spirit that has permeated this work. This has   been Mother Teresa’s fundamental contribution to the order she   has created and run. This it is that explains both why so many   people should flock to join the order, and the interest and   respect she has encountered throughout the world. This springs   from Mother Teresa’s own fundamental attitude to life and her   very special personality. This is clearly and firmly rooted in her   Christian faith. She received the first announcement of the award   of the Peace Prize with these words: “I accept the prize in the   name of the poor. The prize is the recognition of the poor World.   Jesus said, ‘I am hungry, I am naked, I am homeless’. By serving   the poor, I am serving Him”. She is merely repeating what she has so   often said before: “Actually we are touching Christ’s body in the   poor. In the poor it is the hungry Christ that we are feeding, it   is the naked Christ that we are clothing, it is the homeless   Christ that we are giving shelter”. Or again: “When I wash that   leper’s wounds, I feel I am nursing the Lord himself”. She sees   Christ in every human being, and this in her eyes makes man   sacred. The hallmark of her work has been respect   for the individual and the individual’s worth and dignity. The   loneliest and the most wretched, the dying destitute, the   abandoned lepers, have been received by her and her Sisters with   warm compassion devoid of condescension, based on this reverence   for Christ in Man. Better than anyone else she has managed to   put into practice the recognised fact that gifts given de haut   en bas, where the recipient has a feeling of one-sided and   humiliating dependence on the giver, may prove so hurtful to the   recipient’s dignity as a human being, that it may well breed   bitterness and animosity instead of harmony and peace. She has arrived at an attitude to the   relationship between donor and recipient which eliminates the   generally accepted conceptual distinction. In her eyes the person   who, in the accepted sense, is the recipient, is also the giver,   and the one who gives most. Giving – giving something of oneself   – is what confers real joy, and the person who is allowed to give   is the one who receives the most precious gift. Where others see   clients or customers, she sees fellow-workers, a relationship   based not on the expectation of gratitude on the one part, but on   mutual understanding and respect, and a warm human and enriching   contact. She and her Sisters regard their work as a   cherished duty, and not as a burden. Many visitors have described   their first impression of her homes for dying people brought in   from the streets, or of the reception centres for outcast lepers.   Their first impression is likely to be a harrowing one. But in   next to no time they are carried away by the atmosphere of   serenity and joy that the Sisters create around them. This is the   life of Mother Teresa and her Sisters – a life of strict poverty   and long days and nights of toil, a life that affords little room   for other joys but the most precious. A Norwegian poet, who did not share the   religious creed of Mother Teresa, has written a poem containing   an idea she would have no difficulty in recognising: Life can offer one happiness,     That cannot be turned into grief:     Giving joy to another     Is a joy beyond belief. There’s a sorrow that haunts the world,     And never a tear can abate,     But when you’ve realised the truth of this     It’s already, my friend, too late. Who can stand all his life by a grave,     Weeping a bitter tear,     With so many hours in the day,     And so many days in the year? No hour, no day, is lost for Mother   Teresa’s Sisters in Calcutta; for them, these are all hours and   days of joy. Mother Teresa’s work is grounded in the   Christian faith. She has worked among and for people who are not   adherents of her religion; she has been a European among Indians,   but this has proved no obstacle, and perhaps it would be more   correct to say that the work carried out in her spirit has   overcome all obstacles. In 1972 the President of the Republic of   India had these words to say about her: “Mother Teresa is one of those liberated souls who have     transcended all barriers presented by race, religion, and     nationality. In our present- day troubled world, incessantly     plagued by conflict and hatred, the life that is lived and the     work that is carried out by people like Mother Teresa bring new     hope for the future of mankind”. An Indian journalist wrote recently that   “the Sisters with their serene ways, their saris, their knowledge   of local languages… have come to symbolise not only the best in   Christian charity, but also the best in Indian culture and   civilisation, from Buddah to Gandhi, the great saints, the seers,   the great lovers of humanity with boundless compassion and   consideration for the underprivileged: what Shakespeare called   the quality of mercy”. Mother Teresa has personally succeeded in   bridging the gulf that exists between the rich nations and the   poor nations. Her view of the dignity of man has built a bridge.   Unencumbered and naturally she has crossed the gulf by means of   this bridge. In India encounters of this kind between people have   proved possible: they have been welcomed with open arms, and for   this India, too, deserves our appreciation. Her message has found an echo among people   of a different faith: in their tradition, too, we find a groping   for the same answers to questions that form part of our human   existence. With her message she is able to reach   through to something innate in every humankind – if for no other   purpose than to create a potential, a seed for good. If this were   not the case, the world would be deprived of hope, and work for   peace would have little meaning. It would, furthermore, be   incompatible with Mother Teresa’s own view of human beings, the   men and women she serves because she wishes to serve Christ and   approach more closely to Him. Mother Teresa once said: “In these twenty   years of work among the people, I have come more and more to   realise that it is being unwanted that is the worst disease that   any human being can ever experience”. She believes that the worst   disease today is not leprosy or tuberculosis, but rather the   feeling of being unwanted, uncared for and deserted by   everybody. It was precisely people in this plight, the   poorest of the poor, who were the very first to find warmth and   shelter with Mother Teresa. Her intention was to ensure that they   enjoyed the feeling of being received and recognised as people   with their own human dignity and the right to respect. Mother Teresa works in the world as she   finds it, in the slums of Calcutta and other towns and cities.   But she makes no distinction between poor and rich persons,   between poor and rich countries. Politics have never been her   concern, but economic, social, and political work with these same   aims are in complete harmony with her own life’s work. In our endeavours, on the national as on   the international level, we have a lesson to learn from her work   for individuals in distress. On the international level our   efforts can only serve the cause of peace if they do not offend   the self-respect of the poor nations. All aid given by the rich   countries must be given in the spirit of Mother Teresa. There would be no better way of describing   the intentions that have motivated the decision of the Norwegian   Nobel Committee than the comment of the President of the World   Bank, Robert MacNamara, when he declared: “Mother Teresa deserves   Nobel’s Peace Prize because she promotes peace in the most   fundamental manner, by her confirmation of the inviolability of   human dignity”.

"53","1980","Adolfo Pérez Esquivel","  Translation Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,    The Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded the Peace Prize for   1980 to Adolfo Pérez Esquivel. He has devoted many years of his life to   the cause of human rights in Argentina and the whole of Latin   America. He is an untiring and consistent champion of the   principle of nonviolence in the struggle for social and political   liberty. He has lit a light in the dark, a light which, in the   opinion of our Committee, should never be allowed to be   extinguished. Adolfo Pérez Esquivel is, furthermore,   a champion of nonviolence in relations between nations. He has,   for instance, warned of the danger of an escalation of the   territorial conflict between Argentina and Chile. The year 1980 has proved no more   encouraging than 1979 in the struggle to promote human rights and   peace. In Asia last year one of the largest   countries in the area, Iran, rose to overthrow a tyranny and a   dictatorship, renouncing the protection of a major power that had   cooperated with the old regime, and initiating a rapid reduction   of its armed forces. It has subsequently been attacked by a   neighbouring country, and the ensuing war is still being waged.   Moreover, for a whole year the Iranians have been perplexed   spectators to a campaign launched by a superpower in an adjoining   country. This war, too, is still being fought. The war in Afghanistan, more than anything   else, has cast its dark shadow on men and women in the part of   the world to which we Norwegians belong. The fear of loss of   liberty and human rights contends in many minds with the fear of   war. This autumn Europe witnessed the   breakthrough of a movement for freedom in Poland. This movement   has been marked by moderation and a realistic approach. It has   set itself limited goals; it has clung to the policy of   nonviolence; its unshaken spiritual foundation is respect for   human rights. We await the outcome, in anxiety and hope, knowing   that it will have a profound and lasting effect on our entire   continent, as well as far beyond its borders. The two courageous women from Northern   Ireland who received the Nobel Peace Prize for 1976, Mairead Corrigan and Betty   Williams, have made it known publicly that they had nominated   Adolfo Pérez Esquivel for the Peace Prize. They themselves had been awarded the Peace   Prize because, prompted by their own bitter experience, they were   prepared to work actively for peace, brotherhood, and mutual   respect in the relations between Protestant and Roman Catholic   sections of the population in a Northern Ireland racked with   terror, hate-riddened and strickened with fear. The grievous, purely personal stresses and   strains these two brave women, of their own choice, were prepared   to undergo, and the tense situation that still prevails in their   land, illustrate how arduous the struggle for peace, brotherhood   and human dignity may prove. From his closely confined exile in Gorky   the laureate for 1975, Andrei Sakharov, has   conveyed his greetings to Esquivel, through the medium of his   wife, while at the same time the ranks of human rights   protagonists around him have been decimated by arrest and   banishment. In his message Sakharov expresses his   understanding for “the gravity and the tragedy of the problems   facing your country and other countries in Latin America. Your   vigorous struggle for justice and the help you have given to   people suffering under oppression are cherished by people who   live thousands of miles away, in another world”. Last year, Nobel’s Peace Prize was awarded   to Mother Teresa.   She had worked among the most destitute, the lonely, the outcast,   the dying in Calcutta and in other parts of the world. The Committee made it clear that the reason   for awarding her the prize was not the great scope that her   activities had achieved, but the spirit that inspired and   informed it. Those who came or were brought to her and her   sisters were to enjoy “the feeling of being received and   recognised as people with their own human dignity and the right   to respect”. To quote words used on the occasion of the   presentation of the Peace Prize to Mother Teresa in this   University Festival Hall: “Can any political, social, or intellectual feat of     engineering, on the international or on the national plane,     however effective and rational, however idealistic and     principled its protagonists may be, give us anything but a     house built on a foundation of sand, unless the spirit of     Mother Teresa inspires the builders and takes its dwelling in     their building?” In the opinion of our Committee it is this   spirit, too, that inspires her co-religionist Esquivel, in his   choice of a different and wider field of activity than Mother   Teresa’s. He has heard and answered a social and political call   to change the social and political world around him, so that   respect for Man’s right and dignity can be aroused in the hearts   of all, to the benefit of all mankind. May I quote once again from last year’s   presentation ceremony: “Mother Teresa works in the world as she finds it, in the     slums of Calcutta and other towns and cities. But she makes no     distinction between poor and rich persons, between poor and     rich countries. Politics have never been her concern, but     economic, social, and political work with these same aims is in     complete harmony with her own life’s work”. In this respect the award this year has its   parallel in last year’s. Adolfo Pérez Esquivel was born in   Buenos Aires in 1931. He is a well-known architect, and also a   sculptor. His sculptures are to be seen in various public places   in Argentina. In 1968 he was appointed Professor of Architecture   and Sculpture at the National Academy of Art in Buenos Aires. In 1971 his life took a new turn: the Roman   Catholic Church in Latin America was subject to a spirit of   ferment, which influenced him, too. Various circles within the   Church raised fresh questions, with regard to the duties of the   Church and of Christians to the community in which they live.   They espoused the cause not only of respect for human dignity in   the classical sense of the word, but also of economic and social   reforms. They sought contact with workers and peasants, and   supported the landless peasants’ demands for land and the   workers’ right to organisation and solidarity. Esquivel’s intense commitment to the cause   of human rights and nonviolent methods, however, was fuelled by   the special situation that was developing in his own country of   Argentina. There was a risk that a wave of terror and   counterterror might erupt. Esquivel joined a group who rejected   terror as a weapon, seeking inspiration instead from Mohandas   Gandhi and advocating a campaign of nonviolence as a means of   achieving liberation. At a conference in Montevideo in 1968 a   joint organisation was set up embracing active nonviolent groups   throughout Latin America. In 1974 it was decided to continue   along more permanent lines, and Esquivel was entrusted with the   post of Secretary-General, resigning from his professorship in   order to devote himself wholly to his new vocation. The name of the organisation – Paz y   Justicia (Peace and Justice) – clearly indicates the   organisation’s fundamental views and programme. Its publication,   bearing the same name, proved a link between groups of likeminded   persons throughout Latin America. Their activities were, and   still are, coordinated in the organisation’s modest offices in   Buenos Aires. As its Secretary-General Esquivel visited a   number of other countries for the purpose of conferences and   talks. On two occasions he was arrested and expelled – in Brazil   in 1975 and in Ecuador in 1976. In 1976 the organisation moved to   persuade the United Nations to establish a human rights   commission. Documents were drawn up providing evidence of   violations of human rights in Latin America. In order to solicit   support for this Esquivel visited a number of European   countries. On his return he was arrested in Buenos   Aires. No charge was preferred against him; he was not even   interrogated. He has given us little indication of the way he was   personally treated in prison. After fourteen months he was   released, but under the obligation to report to the police, as   well as being subject to other restrictions. These restrictions   were somewhat relaxed in 1979. Meanwhile, he has resumed his work   with Paz y Justicia. This year he was in a position to undertake   a number of fresh journeys, which included Europe. This autumn he   visited the neighbouring country of Chile, in order to conduct a   series of talks with a number of institutions, organisations, and   groups, among them the so-called “Group of 24”, which comprises   lawyers of various political persuasions. Early in the 1970s Argentina experienced   conditions not far removed from civil war, with extreme terrorist   organisations, highly organised and amply supplied with weapons,   creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear with murder, bomb   attacks, abductions, and blackmail. A state of bloody urban   warfare, much of it conducted at night, developed, with   terrorists from the Right and terrorists from the Left ranged   against one another. Successive governments failed to solve the   crisis and to stem the tide. The number of victims rose   alarmingly right up to the year 1976. The military regime that was then   established has, however, itself resorted to extreme violence.   Thousands of people have disappeared without a trace, and we know   that in many cases they have been tortured and killed. This has   been carried out under a veil of profound silence, without any   public announcements, without any trial or verdict. The victims   have been people far removed from terrorism in all its many   forms. In order to prevent the creation of a   climate of public opinion, and to ensure an atmosphere of   indifference and apparent assent to these methods, appeals have   been made to people’s fear of Argentina once again reverting to   the conditions obtaining in the early 1970s. There is no doubt   that this fear is still very much alive today; but in order to   ensure that the wall of silence is not breached, talking and   writing about those who have disappeared – los   desuparecidos – has at the same time become a perilous   undertaking. Among those who have disappeared are journalists who   not only knew too much but who were anxious to publish what they   knew. Throughout these troubled times Adolfo   Pérez Esquivel has stuck unflinchingly to his principles. He   was himself a supporter of far-reaching social and political   reforms. To this extent he was in a position to appreciate some   of the motives that prompted terrorism inspired by the Left. But   when, with Mohandas Gandhi as his great example, he embarked on a   hunger strike in 1970-71, he did so as a protest against   terrorism, both from the Right and from the Left, and among other   things against the abduction – and subsequent blackmail – of one   of the directors for a Fiat factory in Argentina. For this reason he occupies today a   position of great moral strength in his campaign against the   methods that are being used. He can reply calmly to those who   regard his protests against such police methods as a defense and   protection for terrorists. To quote his own words: “We have denounced repression… of all kinds. We have     denounced the killing of generals, colonels and innocent     relatives of military officials. We have no connections with     political parties of any sort, much less armed groups. We act     by means of evangelical nonviolence, which we see as a force     for liberation”. The aims symbolised by the very name of the   organisation, Paz y Justicia, go well beyond a protest against   terror and violence. In his own words: “You cannot talk solely of   human rights in terms of torture, imprisonment and killing. True,   this is the gravest aspect. But we must also look at the case of   the peasant who has no land and is dying of hunger”. For   Esquivel, as for Gandhi, nonviolence involves much more than a   mere passive acceptance of the world as it is. It is a strategy   in a struggle to change the world, using means that will not   stifle the good intentions and the results one aims to   achieve. This is what the movement and its   Secretary-General represent throughout Latin America. It is   divided into three regions, each with its own office, coordinated   from the head office in Buenos Aires. It is ecumenical, and no   one is excluded on religious grounds. Nevertheless it is rooted   in the fermentation and new ideas that have been stirring in the   dominant Roman Catholic Church in Latin America during the last   fifteen years, the visible results of which have included the two   meetings of bishops in Medellin in Colombia in 1968 and in Puebla   in Mexico in 1978. These new trends, however, which have also   encountered a certain amount of resistance, aim to forge new   links between the Church and the broad masses of the people. This   means that clergy and laymen must undertake fresh obligations   within the community. The Church must not be content merely to   carry out its ritual functions – baptism, mass, funerals – which   are part of its accepted routine. Nor must it merely be content   to provide social relief to those in need, in a spirit of   compassion and self-sacrifice – though this, too, has always been   accepted as one of its tasks. Nor must it be content merely to   exercise Man’s duty to his neighbour on the purely personal   level, and in his immediate circle. A new keyword in this Roman Catholic   philosophy has been “evangelisation”, and this word has acquired   an extended meaning. Numerous working and discussion groups have   grown up, in which men and women debate and assume obligations to   their community. The aim, too, is to include the poor and   underprivileged. Attempts have been made to organise them in a   struggle to achieve their rights, by the creation of fresh   organisations or by support for the old ones. The Church is under   strong pressure to define its own attitude to political,   economic, and social problems. A great many different trends are involved:   the organisation possesses no ready-made models or systems   engineered to produce the perfect community. Nor are there any   recipes for economic strategy capable of ensuring a state of   welfare that could be enjoyed by all. This lies outside the task   of the Church in this world. But as a minimum society is expected   not to reconcile itself to conditions that make it impossible for   men and women to gain respect for their human dignity or to   accord this respect to others. The leaders of society, too, are   expected to show in their politics respect for human dignity, in   all men and women, without any exception. The organisation   repudiates any policy inspired by greed, selfishness, and lust   for power, and which ignores the great mass of the people. This is where people like Esquivel take   their place in the social struggle; for him, the strategy of   nonviolence is the only right approach. Poverty spawns terrorism,   and terrorism increases poverty, he once said. It is clear to him   that violence as a means to an end destroys the very aim one   originally dreamt of achieving. Latin America is a subcontinent,   embracing a great many countries with an extreme range of   different conditions. Many of them are much poorer than   Argentina; many of them have inherited far deeper historical   sources of friction between sections of the population with   different origins; and many of them are much smaller and more   helpless than Argentina. Nevertheless, the Committee is of the   opinion that Adolfo Pérez Esquivel has a message that is   valid for the whole of Latin America – and not only for that part   of the world. A great many organisations in Latin America   are working on the basis of the same fundamental principles. Paz   y Justicia may not necessarily have the largest membership. These   fundamental principles are supported by many excellent spokesmen   in numerous countries, men who may be better known than Esquivel.   The reason his voice reached all the way from Latin America to   the Norwegian Nobel Committee was not because of its strength but   because of its purity and clarity. It is our hope that his work   will bear fruit in his own country, that it will hearken to his   voice and break out from the vicious circle of terror and   counter-terror, of anarchy and reaction, setting an example to   the whole of Latin America. Commenting on the Committee’s choice, an   English-speaking newspaper in Buenos Aires had the following   comment to make: “The balance of power between those who are prepared to     defend any means to achieve a particular goal and those who     insist that a crime is a crime, no matter who commits it or for     what reason, has now been changed in Argentina”. It is also gratifying to note that one of   the major Argentinian newspapers, which wrongly suspects the   Norwegian Nobel Committee of ignoring violations of human rights   in other countries with different systems and ideologies from   those obtaining in present-day Argentina, concludes by stating   that if this suspicion were to prove incorrect, then the award of   the prize should be welcomed. This inspires us with hope. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has   frequently been accused, both at home and abroad, of looking at   the world through Norwegian spectacles, from the standpoint of   Norwegian attitudes and Norwegian interests. But we gladly accept this description of   our Committee, which appeared in the great Chilean weekly   Hoy, written by the former Minister of Justice, Professor   Sinhuega, after Esquivel’s visit, in an article entitled Who   is He?: “It [the Norwegian Nobel Committee] is familiar with     Pérez’s work and ideas. It has been informed of torture     and of persons who disappeared. There [in Norway] human life     means a great deal, whatever human life is involved”. Maybe the Committee’s choice reflects the   Norwegian cultural background. This is possibly inevitable. But   in this case, as in others, this background has surely served to   build a bridge between us and champions of human dignity in other   parts of the world, people such as Adolfo Pérez Esquivel and   his fellow workers."
"54","1981","Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"," Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen: The Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded   the Peace Prize for 1981 to the Office of the United Nations High   Commissioner for Refugees. I take it that no one regards the award for   the prize as exclusively – or primarily – a gesture of thanks for   work well and truly carried out in the past. Never have so many millions of people been   driven from their native lands as the case is today. The great   majority of these are to be found in other continents than the   one to which our own country belongs. They are people from countries situated far   away, countries of which we know very little. If we wanted to, we   could so easily close the portals of our senses and the road to   our hearts. One particular group of refugees on which the   attention of the world was focused some years ago, as a result of   newspaper reportage, pictures, and TV programmes, comprises the   so-called Boat People’ escaping across the sea in the waters off   South-East Asia. We read with satisfaction that our sea   captains gave orders to heave-to whenever these wretched people   were encountered in their leaky craft, take them on board, and   transport them to some harbour. They did not choose the easy way   out – closing their eyes and sailing past. They acted according to the moral law of   the sea: you are not allowed to sail past men, women, and   children in peril on the sea, abandoning them to the perils of   wind and wave, to hunger and thirst, to pirates and sharks. On the occasion of this prize award the   question we ought to put to ourselves is as follows: Is one law   valid at sea, another law – or no law at all – in operation on   land for all of us? The award of the prize this year is one of   the very few occasions on which one and the same organisation   will be receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for the second time. The   first time this occurred was in 1955. But on both   occasions the Norwegian Nobel Committee made its decision in   accord with a tradition that has roots going far back in time.   Before the Second World War, in 1938, the Nobel Peace Prize was   awarded to the Nansen   Office, which had been established by the League of   Nations. This office bore the name of the Norwegian   Fridtjof Nansen,   the bold polar explorer, scientist, statesman, and humanitarian –   a man who looms large in the history of his own country. After the First World War he decided to   devote his life and his energy first and foremost to   international humanitarian aid for people in distress or   suffering privation, in the first place refugees and people who   had been driven from various countries. For this work he was   awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1922. For countless homeless   people, people deprived of legal rights, the so-called Nansen   Passport provided a key that would open the door to a new life in   a new country. A strong wave of public opinion here in   Norway supported Nansen in his new work – in admiration, in   pride, and in a spirit of true humanitarianism. In making its   awards the Norwegian Nobel Committee is never swayed by the hope   of maximum popularity and general approval. It must never act   under pressure from public opinion or from any form of political   pressure. It is independent of all authorities, and its duty is   to arrive at its decision in accordance with its best judgment   and conviction. Nevertheless, in making its award for 1981,   as in 1955 and as in 1938, the Committee has done so in the   certainty that in this instance it enjoyed the support of a   tradition in our people which can truly be called a living   tradition. A tradition of this kind, however, among   our people and in other countries, is a flame which must be kept   alive if it is not to die down. When a flood of refugees has   ebbed away, it is tempting to slacken in one’s efforts to provide   aid and relief. The next flood arises, making the same demands on   our conscience and on our willingness to make sacrifices. It is   easy to be seized by feelings of helplessness and fatalism. What,   we may ask, is the use of all this? Let us cultivate our own   garden. And the prosaic questions arise: Can we afford it? Have   we room? But even if there is plenty of room in our hearts, there   may be a shortage of housing and of employment. Only on a broad   international basis can effective refugee aid be organised. It is precisely in situations of this kind   that the Norwegian Nobel Committee has endeavoured to direct the   attention of the world to the problem of refugees – in 1938, in   1955, and now today in 1981. Fridtjof Nansen’s humanitarian work aimed   to relieve the harrowing human tragedies that resulted from the   First World War, and the violent upheavals that followed in its   wake. His work benefited a great many groups of refugees, not   least Russians and Armenians. During the decade that ensued the Nansen   Office made a substantial contribution to the solution or   alleviation of the problems facing these refugees. This work was   continued throughout the 1930s. New categories of refugees arose,   but gradually interest in their problem lapsed. After 1933, however, a new and frightening   series of problems arose, this time involving first and foremost   the stream of political and Jewish refugees fleeing from National   Socialist Germany. There is hardly a single country in Europe,   our own included, in which we are able today with the best   conscience in the world to review our conduct during these years,   when a new stream of refugees knocked at our doors. Fear of   competition in the labour market mingled with reluctance and   hostility of various kinds towards these new strangers. Faced with this situation, the Norwegian   Nobel Committee considered it right and proper to rouse feelings   of conscience and responsibility by awarding the Peace Prize to   the Nansen Office, which was now faced with fresh tasks. Today we   can only state, in the light of what then happened, that this was   in the eleventh hour, in the twilight of world peace. When the Second World War came to an end in   1945, Europe was strewn with human flotsam and jetsam – millions   of prisoners of war, slave labourers, displaced, homeless people,   many of them living in camps or wandering desperately around. The   task of caring for these so-called displaced persons was one that   fell to the Allied military authorities and to the United Nations   Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. It was no easy matter to separate the   refugees from the mass of displaced persons; and we know today   that many refugees, against their will and without further   investigation, were forcibly returned to the country in which   they had lived, there to face an extremely uncertain future. For the years that followed, right up to   the time of the establishment of the Office of the United Nations   High Commissioner for Refugees in 1951, we are today in a   position to state that major refugee problems were solved thanks   to the work of governments, international organisations such as   the provisional IRO (International Refugee Organisation), and   voluntary organisations. Millions of refugees and displaced   persons found a home and work in European and overseas countries.   The same relief work also covered the new stream of postwar   refugees in Europe fleeing from East to West. For refugees   outside Europe special relief organisations were set up – for   Arab refugees from Palestine and for refugees in Korea. When the Office of the High Commissioner   for Refugees was set up in 1951, a great many governments   expressed their reluctance and doubts. In their opinion the work   of caring for refugees could now be left to governments and   voluntary organisations. These, they confidently believed, could   cope with the problems. The Office of the High Commissioner for   Refugees was almost still-born: a large majority voted in favour   of the proposal in the United Nations General Assembly that the   Office should be established with a view to functioning for three   years. During these years it was in receipt of a very limited   contribution from the United Nations budget – between US$600,000   and US$700,000 – and it was expressly forbidden to solicit   governments and organisations for voluntary contributions unless   this had been sanctioned in advance by the General Assembly. In 1953 the General Assembly voted to   extend the life of the Office of the High Commissioner to January   1, 1959. Its future, however, was still uncertain. During these   years refugee problems in Europe were numerically not so   overwhelming as to convince everyone of the need for an   institution under the auspices of the United Nations. This was the position when the Norwegian   Nobel Committee in 1955 decided to give the prize to the Office   of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It was not   awarded in gratitude for work carried out: it was given with a   view to emphasising that the work must be continued, so that one   would be ready to meet new refugee problems on the basis of the   principles of humanitarianism and international justice on which   the Office was built. Hardly a year after this award of the   prize, Europe was the scene of an as yet unforeseen flood of   refugees, as two hundred thousand Hungarians escaped across the   border in October 1956 and the following months. At the same time a major refugee problem   was developing on the African continent, as a result of the war   in Algeria. The tasks taken on by the High Commissioner’s Office   are a direct forerunner of the new situation that arose in the   course of the 1960s and 1979s, and in which we are involved at   present. The refugee problem was no longer first and foremost a   European problem, but had become a global problem, and   appropriately the year 1960 was proclaimed World Refugee   Year. Today, a quarter of a century after the   event, looking back at the prize award in 1955 we can safely say   that the women and men who at that time comprised the Norwegian   Nobel Committee were not devoid of foresight and realism. But it   was no easy task in 1955 to find general acceptance for this   view. The High Commissioner, Poul Hartling, who   is present in the University Festival Hall here today in order to   receive Nobel’s Peace Prize on behalf of the Office of the United   Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, expressed himself as   follows when the Committee in October informed him of their   decision: “I am happy and honoured to receive the prize on behalf   of all refugees. For us in the Office of the United Nations High   Commissioner for Refugees, this means that the voices of the   world’s many millions of refugees have been heard and   understood”. In 1955 the then High Commissioner’ expressed   himself in similar terms. In both cases they presented a correct   picture of the Committee’s purpose in making these awards. A question that was discussed in the   Committee in 1955, and which was then raised in the public and   critical debate on this decision, was whether it was right to   award the prize to an organisation that carried out the duties   with which it had been entrusted as a result of a resolution   passed in the General Assembly of the United Nations. It was   dependent on the aid granted by governments willing to support   this work – and not all of them were – and it received advice   from these governments. Frequently – and to an increasing extent   during the decades after 1955 – it was forced to resort to   diplomacy and make itself inconspicuous, on occasions where   others could assert their opinions, The status of the Office of   the High Commissioner provided great opportunities, but also   entailed limitations. It would not have been difficult in 1955 to   pick good candidates for a prize awarded in order to direct world   attention to the fate of refugees and to the work of assisting   them. There were statesmen and politicians who had made bold   moves in order to help refugees generally or to assist particular   groups of refugees. There had been heads of state who had shown   generosity and hospitality. There were the many voluntary   organisations that had carried on over many years self-denying,   energetic, and patient relief work. But prompting the Committee’s choice, and   the reasons it gave at the time, a definite line of thought can   be glimpsed. It harboured a vision of a world community in which   the respect for man and human rights, on which all refugee work   must inevitably be based, would succeed in achieving universal   recognition and validity. A utopia, a great many people might   say, in 1981 just as much as in 1955. But this attitude also runs   as a leitmotif throughout the practical and realistic political   work undertaken to solve urgent tasks more quickly and more   efficiently. And in both its visionary and realistic form this   attitude is linked, as a symbol and an instrument, to the   United   Nations. In discussions on the urgent and difficult   refugee problems that arose in the distant 1930s, in this country   as well as in other countries, experts in international law   maintained that the right to asylum was not a refugee’s right to   asylum but the right of the individual nation to provide asylum   and refuse extradition to the country from which the person   concerned had fled. To what extent and in what way a government   wished to exercise its right of asylum depended on legislation,   political climate, and the fundamental ideals of one’s own   country. According to international law it was under no   obligation to practise universal rules. In the interwar years, too, governments   entered into agreements and undertook obligations in this sphere.   But after the Second World War the attempt was made to achieve a   breakthrough, and this resulted in the drafting of a Convention   related to the Status of Refugees. It was drawn up in connection   with the establishment of the Office of the United Nations High   Commissioner for Refugees in 1951, and came into force in   1954. It established the right to asylum as a   right enjoyed by the refugee in the land in which he was staying:   no refugee could be handed over to a country in which his life or   freedom was in danger on the grounds of his race, his religion,   his nationality, his social group, or his political opinions. The   Convention also establishes his rights as well as his obligations   in the land that grants him asylum. It goes a step further by   establishing in addition his social and economic rights, which   will enable him to build a new and independent existence and to   be integrated as an individual on equal terms with others in the   community in which he is now living. New provisions have subsequently been added   to the Convention. By no means all governments have subscribed to   the Convention or felt themselves bound by its provisions. But   their number is growing markedly, among all the nations of the   world outside Europe and North America. In a convention which in   1969 was adopted by the Organisation of African States on   “special aspects of the refugee problem in Africa” it was firmly   established that the Convention of 1951 is “the basic and   universal document where the status of refugees is   concerned”. The two Peace Prizes which, in the course   of a quarter of a century, have been awarded to the Office of the   High Commissioner are therefore not merely a recognition of   far-reaching work carried out by the Office in full agreement   with governments and in collaboration with many other   international and national organisations, both   government-controlled and voluntary. These awards were justified   by the resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations   governing the High Commissioner’s Office and by the Convention on   the rights of refugees. They represent both a symbol and a   practical instrument in the long-term work carried out to ensure   that the fundamental principles for this refugee work will   achieve universal recognition and validity. This was the line of   thought that inspired the Committee of 1955, and the Committee in   1981 has been no stranger to this approach. Today a total of ten million refugees has   been registered for the whole world. We know that in reality the   number is greatly in excess of this. Conservative estimates put   it at fourteen to eighteen millions. Only at one point of time   were the figures higher – before the ten million refugees in   Bangladesh were able to return when their country achieved   independence in 1972. Other major refugee problems, too, have   been solved wholly or partly during the last two decades. Here   the High Commissioner’s Office has participated, often playing a   vital role. But one flood of refugees has replaced another, and   the number is on the increase. The majority are no longer to be   found in Europe, but in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Half the   registered refugees are in Africa, but in Asia a new overwhelming   refugee problem has arisen as a result of the war in Afghanistan.   Well over two million Afghans have sought refuge in Pakistan – a   developing country which, without the assistance of international   organisations, is not in a position to tackle the problem   involved in caring for these refugees. As yet we can see no   solution to the problem that their future entails. According to the terms defining the work of   the High Commissioner’s Office as its commencement in 1951, its   primary task was to provide economic and social help. The   so-called stateless refugees still remaining in Europe were to be   given the legal and diplomatic protection which the governments   in the countries from which they had fled could not or would not   give them. The High Commissioner’s Office, in fact, assumed the   protective role which is normally the lot of governments in   relation to their citizens. The most important task was now to   find a final solution to the refugee problem: this would involve   either the refugees voluntarily returning to the land from which   they came, or their being fully integrated with the population of   the country to which they had fled, or that they would be allowed   to emigrate overseas. All this demanded a great deal of   diplomatic cooperation with, and urgent appeals to, a great many   governments. It is impossible in the time at my disposal   to enumerate all the categories and groups of refugees which   exist in the world in this year of 1981, and not even in the   Nobel lecture of the High Commissioner tomorrow will there be   room for them all. The list is a very long one. This is also true   of the states which have received refugees and helped to solve   their problems, and the same is true of the list of countries in   which conditions have been such that people have fled beyond   their borders. As far as a great many of these groups are   concerned, the work of the High Commissioner’s Office is of a   traditional nature. But the very magnitude of the floods of   refugees has necessitated a fundamental revision of the working   methods of the High Commissioner’s Office and an extension of its   sphere of activity. When hundreds of thousands, or even a   million, people come pouring across the borders, the first urgent   task is to provide the aid needed in order to safeguard their   lives and health. We have all read accounts and seen pictures of   families in desperate flight, and of the camps where they have   suffered from shortage of water, food, shelter, and the most   elementary medical care. Most refugees have made their way to   poor countries incapable with their own resources of rescuing   them and caring for them. It is here that the aid given by   international organisations is directed; this must be done   rapidly, often with improvised means, and the difficulties   involved are so great that this work inevitably lays itself open   to criticism. It has been the task of the High Commissioner’s   Office and voluntary organisations to be prepared to face   constantly new situations, and to ensure that the experience   gathered from one crisis is not irretrievably lost before the   next one crops up. This involves not least people fleeing from   war and chaos in their homeland. These may be wars that   constitute various stages in the discontinuance of colonial rule,   or wars between newly created states. They may be civil wars or   wars of secession in which ethnic groups are frequently opposed   to one another. Or again, there may be conditions of anarchy in   which large sections of the population are bereft of all security   and safeguards for life and property. These conditions will often   result in widespread famine, and occasionally it may be difficult   to establish which catastrophes are the work of the natural   elements and which are the work of man. The great bulk of refugees hope to be able   to return to their land of origin. Refugees fleeing from   countries struggling or at war with colonial powers have returned   once independence has been achieved. This was true of the   refugees from the war in Algeria, which was to comprise a   turning-point in the activities of the High Commissioner’s   Office. In the 1970s yet more hundreds of thousands have returned   to the one-time Portuguese colonies. This has also been the case   in Zimbabwe after the cessation of white colonial rule. In   Bangladesh, too, repatriation was the obvious solution after   secessionary wars. This ensued, too, after the civil war or   secessionary war in Sudan had been concluded with an amicable   compromise settlement. In this case the return of the refugees   also involved what has been called “internal refugees” -people   who have fled from their homes and sought refuge in remote areas   within the boundaries of their native land. The aid that had been   made available for the refugees was continued in order to assist   them to return and rebuild their lives after resettlement. The decision on the part of refugees to   return home may, of course, be an expression of the resignation   and desperation provoked by their life as refugees. This may be   true of refugees today returning to Ethiopia or to Laos and   Cambodia. In such cases the important task is to assist them   materially, and, if possible, to protect them against   persecution. But the High Commissioner’s Office has maintained   the fundamental principle that no refugee must be repatriated   against his or her will, or under any form of coercion whatever,   and in cases where this has taken place it has been in direct   violation of the wishes of the High Commissioner’s Office. There are also refugees who have little or   no hope of ever being able to return to the land from which they   came – or at any rate not unless this were made possible as a   result of a war conducted against the government in their land of   origin. This applies in Africa, e.g., to refugees from Rwanda and   Burundi. In such cases the expulsion of ethnic groups, rather   than flight, may be involved. Many of these and other refugees in   Africa have been assisted to start a new life in the adjoining   countries to which they have fled. Often, but by no means always,   refugees have been received with hospitality on the other side of   the border by a population belonging to the same ethnic group. In   other respects, too, there are grounds for expressing our   profound gratitude for the hospitality that a large number of   African states have shown. Many of these refugees have been given   grants of land to cultivate, and Tanzania has set an excellent   example by giving over 30,000 refugees full citizen rights. The opportunities for permanent settlement   in the host country are far more limited in South and Southeast   Asia, where there is a shortage of land and extreme population   density. The settling of ten million refugees from Bangladesh in   the Indian border areas was never a feasible proposition. Special   historical reasons made it possible for 700,000 refugees from   Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to be granted asylum in western   countries, in the first place in the United States, but also in   France and a number of other countries. In the 1980s, however,   there will be limits to the number of refugees from Asia and   Africa who can be received and integrated in the industrial   countries. Economic crises and unemployment have created a   situation very different from the one obtaining in the 1950s and   1960s. This also applies to refugees who are more difficult to   integrate than is the case with refugees in postwar Europe. Dealing as it does with a great many   governments, whose cooperation is desirable, in many cases as   well governments in the countries from which the refugees come,   the High Commissioner’s Office has had to make use of diplomatic   channels. It has been in a position to offer what might be called   “its good offices” as arbitrator and go-between in relations   between governments with different interests to safeguard. But   throughout this activity consideration for the refugees   themselves and their fate has been inevitably the one and only   guiding principle. We may well entertain a vision of a world   without refugees – a world in which men and women are never in   jeopardy on account of their religion, their nationality, their   political views, or their membership of any group, of a world in   which people need never flee from war and civil strife. But this   is not the sort of world in which we live. We can so easily be   seized by despair or cynicism, by the wish to cultivate our own   garden and to be sufficient unto ourselves. In the years that lie ahead, too, we shall   encounter men and women on the run. It is beyond the capacity of   mankind to predict where and when new refugee problems will   arise. But we possess the fundamental ideas on human rights and a   sense of fellow feeling that goes beyond countries and   continents, religions, cultures, and racial borders. We live in a   world community of states, as reflected in the United Nations.   But we are living, too, in the world community of men and women –   many of them men and women who are stateless. The Office of the United Nations High   Commissioner for Refugees is a bridge linking the world community   conceived as a community of states and the world community   conceived as a community of men and women. We have a duty to the   refugees, and this is a duty to ourselves and the very basis of   our own existence. We thank the Office of the United Nations   High Commissioner for Refugees for all it has done for countless   refugees, and we should like to express the hope that in the   troubled times that may lie ahead the High Commissioner’s Office   will carry the flaming torch that Fridtjof Nansen once lit in our   country and in other countries, and that the Office will turn to   us again and again and challenge us to do our duty."
"55","1982","Alva Myrdal, Alfonso García Robles","    Translation Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:    People occasionally ask whether the task of nominating Peace   Prize winners may not prove a difficult one.    It is certainly not difficult to understand the reasoning   prompting this sort of question. Naturally a Peace Prize   committee, too, is bound to feel a sense of affliction at the   setbacks suffered by the cause of peace. Great is our   disappointment every time national boundaries are violated, and   naked force of arms unleashed. One knows the feeling of despair   at the news that innocent people are being killed and old enmity   rekindled.    The world in which we live is not at peace. Tensions and   unresolved disputes are dominant features of our age. Despite   disarmament conferences and other verbal endeavours to promote   peace, the armaments race continues. Military budgets merely   mount up, and have today reached a level of close to 65 billion   dollars annually. Nuclear armaments are the cause of deepest   concern. With these weapons the killing power of the super powers   appears to have reached its maximum potential – the extermination   of the human race. There are, in short, ample grounds for   pessimism in our time.    But, as one of this year’s laureates has declared: “Giving up is   not human!” And it is, in fact, from the ranks of people imbued   precisely with such ideas that the Norwegian Nobel Committee has   this year made its choice.    Alva Myrdal and Alfonso García Robles have, in the opinion   of the Committee, proved outstanding candidates for two reasons.   In the first place owing to their magnificent work in the   disarmament negotiations of the United Nations, where they have both played   crucial roles and won international recognition; and secondly   because, too, they have made such a notable contribution to the   task of informing world opinion on the problems of armaments and   of arousing the acceptance by the general public of their joint   responsibility for the train of events.    In awarding Nobel’s Peace Prize to these two, the Committee   wishes to focus attention on what – despite the many gloomy   prospects – nevertheless constitutes a bright spot. There are   people who are not satisfied merely to draw attention to alarming   trends, but who also devote their energy and their ability to   turning the tide. Pessimism and anxiety for the future have   failed to unnerve a few hardy souls, who are endeavouring to   convey the message that the fate of mankind has by no means been   finally sealed, and that the nuclear holocaust is not the only   possible outcome of the conflicts and disputes we face.    The climate of public opinion for peace and disarmament initiated   in the western world is on the march, and is now thrusting its   way across many national boundaries. The idea of calling a halt   to the nuclear armaments race is no longer quite so impossible.   Leading politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have grasped   its sense of deep commitment, and are giving it their support. It   may well be a sign of the times that during the recent elections   to Congress and the Senate in the USA there was a substantial   majority in a number of states in favour of freezing nuclear   armaments at their present level.    The leaders of public opinions for peace and disarmament in the   West know to their chagrin what a poor hearing they command in   the East. But even here, too, they are not without their allies,   of which maybe the most important is the common fear of total   extermination in a nuclear war, a fear which we may assume is   felt just as forcibly over there as in our part of the world.   After all, overriding all conflicting interests there exists a   common interest in survival.    Nevertheless, under no circumstances would it be human to give   up. And this is precisely the keynote of the message we have   received from this year’s Peace Prize winners.    Alva Myrdal’s commitment to the service of disarmament has long   since established her international reputation. The many awards   and other marks of high honour she has received testify to her   standing in the international community.    Her commitment, moreover, reveals a tremendous span, both in   terms of time and spheres of interest. As far back as the 1930s   she played a prominent part in developing the modern Swedish   welfare state. She was a staunch champion of women’s liberation   and equal rights. She has proved a brilliant diplomat, and was   the first woman to be appointed head of a department in the   United Nations.    On an occasion like this it is only right and proper that a   Norwegian Nobel Committee should recall her fearless and   notable work on behalf of Norway during the Second World War. For   this she was deservedly awarded His Majesty King Haakon VII’s   Freedom Cross.    Alva Myrdal belongs to the world community: but she is   ideologically firmly rooted in Nordic constitutional principles   and in our democratic ideals. These were the ideals that   motivated her when she acted as head of delegation during the   disarmament negotiations in Geneva. Nor is that all: in other UN   contexts, too, she has been a staunch spokesman of peace and   disarmament.    As a researcher and disarmament expert, with a wide knowledge of   the problems of world politics, she has commanded attention in   the international forum, and not least in her literary work where   her influence has been profound.    It is no doubt typical of great personalities that it is easy   both to agree and disagree with them. Alva Myrdal is hardly an   exception to this rule: but on one point all will agree – her   name has become a rallying point for men and women who still   cling to the belief that in the last resort, mind is bound to   triumph over matter.    Today, in her eighty-first year, she can look back on a life   which must of necessity have been not only rich but also   dramatic. It must have alternated between hope and   disappointment, and almost certainly, too, between encouragement   and discouragement.    So much the greater on such occasions the joy of witnessing the   fruits of one’s labour, heralding the consummation of the dream   conceived in the finest moment of life. In this connection it   might be fitting to recall Bjornstjerne Bjornson’s words All that your hopes have illumined,     all that your fears have bedewed – now grows apace. For obvious reasons Alfonso García   Robles is less well known in the Nordic countries. But, as we all   know, a considerable part of the world is situated outside the   North. And in international disarmament work García Robles   bears a name that is truly illustrious. He was the driving force   behind the agreement, signed in Mexico City in 1967, that   declared Latin America a denuclearised zone. And in view of the   fact that the wording of this treaty is so markedly the work of   Garcia Robles, it gives us at the same time a very fair   description of the man and his way of thinking.    The outstanding feature of this agreement – the first of its kind   in the world – is a realistic view of the destructive power   inherent in nuclear arms. The starting point for the agreement   that was reached is a clear recognition that nuclear arms are in   essence not defensive weapons, but weapons of self-destruction.   They are – to quote the words of the agreement – an attack on the   integrity of the human race, and could in the final resort even   render the world uninhabitable.    It has rightly been maintained that the first essential condition   required for the solution of political problems is the moral   courage to look these problems in the face. Frequently this is   precisely what is lacking, and this is maybe particularly   applicable to the problem of nuclear arms. It is such a   temptation to shut one’s eyes. It is as though the process of   comprehension were obstructed. We are not in a position to pursue   our own reasoning to its logical conclusion. At some point or   other we recoil, lacking the courage to know what we actually   know. The truth concerning the situation that has been created by   modern nuclear weapons is so horrifying that in a way it numbs   our ability to comprehend it.    The American social economist and author Professor John Kenneth   Galbraith has expressed this in the following words: “The truth that men seek there to evade is that this small     planet cannot survive a nuclear exchange… Asked if we want     life for our children and grandchildren, we affirm that we do.     Asked about nuclear war, the greatest threat to that life, we     regularly dismiss it from mind. Man has learned to live with     the thought of his own mortality. And he now has accommodated     to the thought that all may die, that his children and     grandchildren will not exist. It’s a capacity for accommodation     at which we can only marvel. I suspect that our minds accept     the thought but do not embrace the reality. The act of     imagination is too great or too awful. Our minds can extend to     a war in some distant jungle and set in motion the actions that     reject it. But not yet to the nuclear holocaust. A commitment     to this reality is now the supreme test of our politics.” It is in the light of this that we should   consider the agreement that declared Latin America a   denuclearised zone. Alfonso García Robles has rightly been   called the father of the Mexico Agreement. It is his ideas and   his realistic assessment that are reflected in the wording. He is   one of those people who possess the courage to face the truth of   the situation created by nuclear arms. And it is precisely for   this reason, too, that the successful negotiation of the   agreement redounds so very much to his credit.    Once the horrific truth about nuclear arms is recognised, the   question of nuclear armament likewise acquires a fresh dimension.   It is no longer a question of being for or against national   defence or an international system of security. The development   of nuclear arms has taken us well beyond this stage in the   argument. As everyone knows, there are today divided opinions on   the justification of military defence. Many of us believe – in   the light of what history has taught us – that a credible defence   of freedom, independence, and humanity must, in fact, be regarded   as the defence of peace. Others adopt a more or less consistent   pacifist attitude.    What the Mexico Agreement, however, so clearly demonstrates is   that we can no longer continue our argument on this level. The   matter has acquired a fresh perspective: we must seek a way out,   so that mankind can survive. This is the real disarmament problem   facing us today.    This has provided a platform on which all mankind will have to   come together, irrespective of political views or strategic   considerations. The alternative is a continued nuclear build-up   and the proliferation of nuclear arms, which can only lead   ultimately to a catastrophe.    Man was once told: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall   inherit the earth”. Today we know that if the peacemakers fail in   their efforts, there will be no one left to inherit the earth, an   earth, moreover, no one would consider it worthwhile   inheriting!    Putting this truth across has been, and still is, the prime   concern of this year’s Peace Prize winners. What they have   clearly shown us, too, is that the work of promoting peace and   disarmament must be carried on at several levels. It is vital to   spread information on the issue involved, so that a growing body   of public opinion capable of exerting pressure can be built up.   But this is not the only object, as Alva Myrdal has   explained: “We must dare to believe that in their heart of hearts men     desire peace on earth, but we shall never achieve this merely     by coining slogans such as ‘We Want Peace!’ Our aim must be     backed by intense efforts to find constructive proposals. The     challenge facing peace workers is not to be found in a single     universal question-and-answer, but in peaceful solutions to a     host of conflicts, and in the exertion to achieve peace on many     different levels.” This is precisely what the two Peace Prize   winners have confirmed in their endeavours. They know – better   than most people – what it means “to make intense efforts to find   constructive proposals”. They have sought no facile short cuts,   because they know how vital it is that negotiations on   disarmament should be conducted on the basis of down-to-earth   realism and on the assumption of give-and-take between the great   powers.    And it is precisely in this connection – when we mention the   concept of give-and-take – that we get some notion of how   complicated and exhaustive the problem of disarmament is. It is   not sufficient merely to demonstrate a desire for peace; nor is   it sufficient simply to declare that nuclear arms must be done   away with. There is no difficulty in getting a wide measure of   agreement on aims of this kind.    Difficulty arises when these aims are to be realised through the   medium of practical political decisions; and this too is a   problem we must have the courage to face up to.    We have watched with growing impatience how difficult it is for   the nuclear powers to reach agreement on even the most modest   measures of disarmament; and we may well ask why it has not been   possible to make any progress with all the negotiations that have   been conducted. Maybe the ideological differences are too great?   Maybe it is impossible to break through the barrier of mutual   mistrust, which unfortunately has received far too much   nourishment? Is it once again fear that dominates and dictates   the premises on which global political decisions are made?    It is not easy to give a simple answer. Maybe this, too, is a   fact we shall have to take into account.    But what we can all see is that a power struggle and intense   rivalry are being waged between the great powers. In this   struggle there are several parties who believe that they are   compelled to safeguard vital interests, and who are genuinely   afraid of jeopardising the security of their country. For this   reason they feel compelled, one and all, to take military   precautions. It is not difficult to understand an attitude of   this kind.    But there is also a great deal to suggest that the big powers are   caught in what has been called the symbiotic trap, in which the   parties concerned are mutually motivating one another to arm.   This is how the trap works: In the East, information is received   to suggest that the West has plans for further rearmament. And   for this reason the East is compelled to arm – out of   consideration for its own security. In the West similar   information is received on new types of weapons being developed   in the East, and so the West is forced to react – they dare not   do otherwise. With each side placing the blame on the other, an   excuse is found for justifying the arms race.    The persons principally responsible for the present development   are, as a result of this, bound to be subject to tremendous   pressure. In these circumstances it would be difficult to arrive   at solutions which all parties concerned would consider   worthwhile and which they feel would ensure their safety. Very   careful assessment is necessary in order to arrive at solutions   of this kind, the main problem being to arrive at a platform on   which all interested parties can, despite their differences, come   together.    The question now is whether the fresh situation that has been   created by the nuclear powers might not be capable of providing a   platform of this kind, since no one can any longer be in any   doubt that today a joint interest, overshadowing all else, exists   for all the nations of the world – viz. to put a stop to the   nuclear arms race. This is the problem, overshadowing all others,   to which we must turn our gaze, and in our endeavours to reach   this goal all our efforts must and can be coordinated.    It is in the light of this that we can observe two clear lines   emerging in the work of disarmament. We have the meticulous work,   demanding a great deal of patience and time, that is carried on   through international negotiations for mutual disarmament. And it   should be emphasised that it is along this line that lasting and   real results can be achieved. But we have in addition the work of   the various peace movements, consciously committed to creating a   body of public opinion, and it must also be emphasised that if   this body of opinion is allowed to grow in strength and health,   reaching out across still more national boundaries, it could   constitute a decisive factor in ensuring the success of   international negotiations.    The way ahead may appear long and difficult, and it certainly   makes great demands both on the imagination and the patience –   and maybe above all on the unflinching honesty which dares to   look truth in the face, and still has the courage to   continue.    In awarding this year’s Peace Prize to Alva Myrdal and   García Robles, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to   express its recognition of the intense endeavours undertaken by   two people to find constructive solutions to difficult   international disarmament negotiations.    At the same time the Committee is anxious – and in this   connection we believe we are speaking in the spirit of the   prizewinners – that the Peace Prize this year should be   interpreted as well as a helping hand to that body of public   opinion for the promotion of peace and disarmament to which they   themselves have proved such a valuable inspiration."
"56","1983","Lech Walesa"," Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:    “Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and   inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the   foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.”                Thus begins the text of the United                Nations’ Declaration of Human Rights, a declaration which, with                its definition of the concept of peace, forms the basis of the Norwegian                Nobel Committee’s decision to award this year’s Peace Prize to the                Polish trade union leader, Lech Walesa.    The campaign for human rights is, necessarily, an inseparable   part of the struggle for peace. The selection of a Peace Prize   winner on these grounds is not new: laureates such as the South   African Albert Lutuli, Martin Luther King from   the U.S.A., Andrei   Sakharov from the U.S.S.R., and the Argentinian Adolfo Pérez Esquivel received,   their awards on just these grounds. The Committee believes that   this year’s prize winner can justly take his place among this   gathering of campaigners for human rights.    Consideration of the question of human rights raises the well   known problem: “Why does humanity advance so slowly?” It has,   however, become more generally recognised that a peace which is   won and defended through the violation of human rights, is a   peace which neither can nor ought to be permanent.    The present generation has perhaps learned this in a way no   previous generation experienced. Military occupation and foreign   domination, together with the associated evils of physical and   mental terror, have led more and more people to understand the   great truth – that “freedom and life are one”. Peace is created   where people live and breathe in freedom, and where one does as   one would be done by.    We can assume that such thoughts lie behind the United Nations’   Declaration of Human Rights – which the world community has   adopted as the basis for peaceful coexistence between peoples and   nations. For the Norwegian Nobel Committee it was a natural   development to consider the Peace Prize in the light of this   declaration. Through the presentation of this year’s award the   Committee once again draws the attention of the world community   to its own definition of the concept of peace.    It follows from this that the Committee’s deliberations and   decisions are necessarily independent of national and political   boundaries. The guidelines given to the Committee in Alfred   Nobel’s will stipulate that the presentation of the Peace Prize   is the responsibility of the Committee alone, and cannot be   influenced by outside forces. Thus the Nobel Peace Prize can   never be more – or less – than a hand stretched out to   individuals or groups who give expression to the longing for   peace and freedom felt by all the peoples of the world, wherever   they live. We believe that it is in the spirit of Alfred Nobel’s   legacy that the Peace Prize should be a gesture of solidarity   with those who, in the service of peace, campaign for humanity’s   highest ideals.    Human dignity is an important concept in this connection. The   phrase has two central connotations: firstly, that the dignity of   humanity is inviolable, and, secondly, that each and every human   being has the same, everlasting value. A natural corollary of   this is that we all have a common duty to defend human dignity.   All thoughts of solidarity – even the command to love one another   – have their foundation here. Human dignity is humanity’s shared   possession, a possession which we all have both a part in and a   responsibility for. We are bound together in a common lot which   makes it impossible for us to be unaffected by the fate of   others.    Another Nobel Prize winner, Ernest Hemingway,   opens one of his novels with a famous quotation from the English   poet John Donne which illustrates this point with an almost   shocking clarity:    “No man is an island, intire of its self; every man is a piece of   the Continent, a part of the maine; if a clod bee washed away by   the sea, Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie were;   as well as if a Mannor of thy friends or of thine owne were; any   mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And   therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls   for thee.”    This is the way in which we ought to experience humanity’s   oneness. “Any man’s death diminishes me.” Every brother being in   chains is my shame. Every longing for freedom which is   suppressed, every human right which is violated is a personal   defeat for me – because we are united in human kind and share one   another’s fate.    Up from this ideal of human oneness this year’s prize winner has   raised a burning torch, a shining name, the name of Solidarity.   He has lifted the torch unarmed; the word, the spirit and the   thought of freedom and human rights were his weapons. And, as is   so often the case, the struggle involved great personal   sacrifice, even though the object was something as simple as the   workers’ right to establish their own organisations. This is a   right which, again, is confirmed in the world community’s   declaration of human rights.    The Norwegian Nobel Committee has evaluated Lech Walesa’s   contribution in this field as being of essential importance in   the campaign to establish the universal freedom of organisation   in all countries. It is in just this context that the name   “Solidarity” has its deepest and most wide- ranging meaning. Lech   Walesa’s contribution is more than a domestic Polish concern; the   solidarity for which he is spokesman is an expression of   precisely the concept of being at one with humanity; therefore he   belongs to us all. The world has heard his voice and understood   his message; the Nobel Peace Prize is merely a confirmation of   this.    Lech Walesa has made the name “Solidarity” more than an   expression of the unity of a group campaigning for special   interests. Solidarity has come to represent the determination to   resolve conflicts and obliterate disagreement through peaceful   negotiation, where all involved meet with a mutual respect for   one another’s integrity.    Conflicts and disagreements can be various, and can lead to many   different reactions. Those involved will inevitably be faced with   complicated decisions. This was the situation one August day in   1980, when Lech Walesa climbed over the steel fence of the Lenin   yards in Gdansk, took the microphone and at a stroke became the   leader of Polish solidarity. He was faced with overwhelming   difficulties; the choice of strategy was not easy. The goal was   clear enough: the workers’ right to organise and the right to   negotiate with the country’s officials on the workers’ social and   economic situation. But which of the many available paths would   lead him to this goal?    This is not the occasion to evaluate the political situation Lech   Walesa found himself in. Suffice it to say that it was difficult.   More interesting to us now is the fact that Walesa’s chosen   strategy was that of peace and negotiation. And, as always in   such situations, the willingness to negotiate implied the   willingness to compromise – here because it was obvious that the   opponent was also fighting adverse conditions, both economic and   political. Solidarity came to represent, as a result of a   mobilisation of the national will – the so called “Polish social   opposition”, the possibility of a solidarity of opinion in the   whole nation. This was not an opposition which involved the use   of physical power. Rather, it was a question of a spiritual or   intellectual power which, because of its universal acceptance in   the populace, would permeate the system and dissolve conflicts   from within.    By following this peaceful course, without resorting to violence,   Solidarity became a rapidly expanding movement. The courage which   Lech Walesa showed in stepping forward openly and unarmed was   overwhelmingly rewarded by the millions of Polish workers and   farmers who joined him in his struggle.    Thus, in awarding the Peace Prize to Lech Walesa today, the   Committee wishes it not only to be seen as a token of respect,   but also as an expression of gratitude for the peaceful courage   he showed when choosing his course.    That Walesa and the movement he leads are in keeping with the   highest of human ideals is confirmed not least by the close   connections which have existed between Solidarity and the Polish   church. This interdependence is based not on common political   interests, but rather on an ideological unity in the perception   of human value and human rights.    It has not escaped the Committee’s notice that the Polish church,   which is a popular church in a way that few European churches   are, has been so consistent in its support of Lech Walesa; this   has given Solidarity an invaluable moral strength. One has great   expectations of the role the church can come to play in Polish   society given its standing among the people.    As outsiders we are particularly aware of the way in which   Solidarity – also through its attachment to the church – has   shown its willingness for peace and reconciliation. We have seen   them gather in their tens of thousands in and around the churches   in prayer for their land and cause. We have seen them water with   their tears the wreaths of the victims of the fight for freedom.   And we have understood that their unarmed battle is a battle they   fight not only for their own sake, but also for all   liberty-loving people the world over.    It is in this perspective that the Norwegian Nobel Committee has   seen Lech Walesa’s contribution. The way he chose was the way of   negotiation, peace and reconciliation.    In the world we live in it is shockingly clear that détente   and the peaceful resolution of conflicts is more necessary than   ever before. We have seen too much of what the brutal use of   power can lead to. If history has taught us anything, it is that   the use of violence and power can, in the long run, only mobilise   the powers of death.    Unfortunately, we have also learned that the voice of history   does not always tell of victory for humanity and peace. It is   pertinent to ask whether idealistic and morally sound attitudes   do, in fact, have any chance of success.    This question can, of course, also be raised in the case of Lech   Walesa. True enough, it would be strange if the causes he   represents did not succeed, if only in the long run. He was not a   political trouble maker: his concerns were rather the Polish   workers’ interests and current demands. But such demands are not   always successful, even when they are as justified as they are in   Lech Walesa’s case.                No, Lech Walesa raised no revolutionary banner, and espoused no                other weapon than the peaceful strike weapon which is recognised                by the world community. Neither did he claim support from the declarations                of human rights emanating from the United Nations and the Helsinki                agreement. He wished only to negotiate. Two things alone were of                pressing interest: the workers’ social conditions and their right                to negotiate.    The background to this singlemindedness was the simple fact that   these rights were not recognised. This had led to outbreaks of   universal bitterness on several occasions previously – in 1956,   in 1970, and so again in 1980. All of these outbreaks were   concerned with precisely these problems: social conditions,   freedom of expression and the right to organise.    One can reasonably wonder why it should be so difficult to   achieve recognition for such aims. Those who know but a little of   the history of the international labour movement will be aware   that such difficulties have always been present. It is still   remarkable, however, that working people’s elementary rights can   be denied, irrespective of to which ideology or economic system   the respective countries belong. One ought, perhaps, to be able   to believe that there are boundaries behind which it is not   necessary to campaign for workers’ rights; such boundaries   obviously don’t exist.    It is clear that, although Lech Walesa primarily campaigned for   elementary social rights without challenging the established   power structure, his campaign had inevitable political and   ideological overtones. His campaign has also been necessarily a   campaign for human rights, and, as such, inevitably interpreted   as an obstruction against the system by the political   authorities.    As the political opposition to Solidarity grew, its own   consciousness of standing for humanity and human rights became   clearer. It became increasingly obvious that Lech Walesa’s   campaign for workers’ rights was from the very beginning a   contribution to the general campaign for human rights in the   world. This connection was emphasised more and more – especially   by intellectual groups within the movement, and also by the   Polish church.    Campaigners for human rights, independent of where in the world   they have lived and worked, have always had one common problem:   How can the idealistic goal be realised when one is obliged, at   the same time, to take into account the practical possibilities   in the given situation. Is it wise to moderate demands and   campaign for a step-by-step improvement?    This problem faced Lech Walesa. Was a cautious course – with the   possibility of gaining some ground – the right one? Or should one   risk – and stand to loose – everything? It is impossible to   understand the Polish Solidarity movement without being aware of   this problem.    A realistic evaluation of the existing situation would suggest   that the best course was to aim for a combination of the existing   one party government with a social pluralism which permitted the   freedom to organise and negotiate – at any rate in the future.   Such a solution was the first negotiating model.    We know now that even this moderate strategy failed. Solidarity   is today a forbidden organisation. The negotiations and the   strikes which were designed to emphasise the seriousness of the   negotiations led to the state of emergency and the arrest and   imprisonment of Lech Walesa.    And, even though the state of emergency is rescinded and Walesa   is freed, his freedom is limited. His own evaluation of the   situation has not permitted him to be present here today. The   Peace Prize laureate’s seat is empty; it won’t be his voice we   hear. Let us therefore try even harder to listen to the silent   speech from his empty place.    At the present time, Lech Walesa cannot be presented as a victor   at the end of a struggle full of sacrifice. His chosen course was   not as short and easy as that. And it could seem that the goals   he set himself are just as distant still.    But is Lech Walesa really silent today? Is he completely without   victory? Has his cause suffered defeat? Many are of the opinion   that his voice has never been stronger and reached further than   it does now. The electrician from Gdansk, the carpenter’s son   from the Vistula valley has managed to lift the banner of freedom   and humanity so high that the whole world can once again see it.   The power of his belief and vision is unweakened. His actions   have become a chapter in the history of international labour, and   the future will recognise his name among those who contributed to   humanity’s legacy of freedom. Once again the stone rejected by   the builder has become a cornerstone; this time a cornerstone in   the building of freedom and democracy which humanity, with   varying degrees of success, is attempting to raise in our   world.    It is in any case certain that Lech Walesa’s efforts have an   important message for our times. It is the Committee’s opinion   that he stands as an inspiration and a shining example to all   those who, under different conditions, fight for freedom and   humanity.    If, in a future which we hope is not too distant, there should   again be attempted a compromise between the Polish authorities   and the country’s workers and farmers, Lech Walesa’s   participation will be both necessary and indispensable.    For he is a victor in the eyes of the ordinary worker or farm   labourer; he is a victor in the eyes of the people and their   church. And he is one of the great spokesmen in the world today   for the longing for freedom that can never be silenced.    Lech Walesa has made humanity bigger and more inviolable. His   ambivalent good fortune is that he has won a victory which is not   of this, our political, world. The presentation of the Peace   Prize to him today is a homage to the power of victory which   abides in one person’s belief, in his vision and in his courage   to follow his call."
"57","1984","Desmond Tutu"," Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:    The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes, through the presentation of   this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, to direct attention to a unifying   leader figure in the campaign to solve South Africa’s apartheid   problem by peaceful means. The situation as it is today is such   that a peaceful solution is by no means inevitable – the   repression is so brutal that a violent rebellion would be an   understandable reaction. The South African has more reason now   than ever before to exclaim “Cry the beloved country”. Given this situation it is all the more   remarkable that human beings are able to choose a peaceful way to   freedom. It is the Nobel Committee’s opinion that   the means by which the South African liberation process is   conducted will have wide-ranging consequences for the whole of   the African continent, and therefore also for the cause of peace   in the world. This is an opinion which is also expressed in a   number of United   Nations resolutions – most recently that passed by the   Security Council in October this year. Racial discrimination in   South Africa is rightly regarded as a threat to peace and as an   outrageous violation of basic human rights. Fortunately, a peaceful alternative exists.   On a broad front a campaign is being fought with the weapons of   the spirit and reason – a campaign for truth, freedom and   justice. In recognition of the fact that it is this alternative   which must succeed, the South African bishop, Desmond Tutu, has   been selected as this year’s Peace Prize laureate. The contribution he has made, and is still   making, represents a hope for the future, for the country’s white   minority as well as the black majority. Desmond Tutu is an   exponent of the only form for conflict solving which is worthy of   civilised nations. It is today 23 years since the Nobel Peace   Prize was last awarded to a South African. On that occasion it   was Albert Lutuli,   then president of the African National Congress, who was   presented with the prize. It is the Committee’s wish that this   year’s award should be seen as a renewed recognition of the   courage and heroic patience shown by black South Africans in   their use of peaceful means to oppose the apartheid system. This   recognition is also extended to all who, throughout the world,   stand in the forefront of the campaign for racial equality as a   human right. It is unfortunately not only in South   Africa that human rights are violated. Another former   prizewinner, Amnesty   International, informs us that it is known to occur in 117   countries, and that prisoners of conscience are tortured in 60   countries. Too frequently, the brutal features of power and   violence mar the face of our times. But if we are willing to look   for it, we can also see the face of peace – even if we have to   peer through prison bars and barbed wire to find it. And, in   spite of everything, new hope is raised, on each occasion we see   how the spirit of man refuses to be conquered by the forces of   hate. Some time ago television enabled us to see   this year’s laureate in a suburb of Johannesburg. A massacre of   the black population had just taken place – the camera showed   ruined houses, mutilated human beings and crushed children’s   toys. Innocent people had been murdered. Women and children   mortally wounded. But, after the police vehicles had driven away   with their prisoners, Desmond Tutu stood and spoke to a   frightened and bitter congregation: “Do not hate”, he said, “let   us choose the peaceful way to freedom”. It is with admiration and humility we today   present the Nobel Peace Prize to this man. Desmond Tutu’s contribution to the   liberation struggle was given a special significance in 1978 when   he became the first black secretary of the South African Council   of Churches. This Council of Churches is both a joint forum for   the churches of South Africa and the national representative for   the World Council of Churches. It includes all the major churches   in the country – with the exception of the Boer Church which   withdrew as a result of disagreement with the Council over the   question of apartheid. The Catholic Church is a so-called   associate member, but is also one of the Council’s strongest   supporters. As around 75 percent of all citizens of   South Africa are members of a church, the body is a very   representative organisation. Few other organisations can make the   same claim to speak for the black population. As the dynamic leader of this Council,   Desmond Tutu has formulated as his goal “a democratic and just   society without racial segregation”. His minimum demands are:   equal civil rights for all, the abolition of the Pass Laws, a   common system of education and the cessation of the forced   deportation of blacks from South Africa to the so-called   “homelands”. Both through these objectives and through   its practical activities the South African Council of Churches   has obviously exceeded the normal scope of such an organisation.   The Council has become a trailblazer in the campaign for human   rights, a central force in a liberation struggle and an   increasingly wide-ranging support organisation for the many   victims of the present system’s racial discrimination. Consider   what happens when millions of human beings are deported. Their   homes are razed to the ground. Their personal possessions are   taken from them. They lose their jobs, and are physically   transported and deposited in the empty veld with just a tent and   a sack of maize as their only hopes of survival. 3 millions have been deported in this way,   while new millions await their turn. If we ignore for a moment the personal   humiliation, the question remains – who is there to help these   people to survive in their new existence? Who will help them   house themselves, find water, tend to the sick or educate their   children? The system also has – obviously – its   political prisoners. Their crime is the necessary one of wanting   a society with freedom and respect for human rights! They are   imprisoned – but who is there to help their families? There is also the so-called “migration   labour” system under which underpaid labourers are obliged to   live away from their families. The Pass Laws are also notorious;   they burden the black population with a collective captivity and   make them foreigners in their own country. Anyone breaking these   laws risks group arrest and indefinite imprisonment without legal   help. It is not difficult to imagine that, as a   result of this system, there are considerable social, medical and   legal problems which necessitate help from the South African   Council of Churches. It is a pleasure to note that over 90   percent of the Council’s budget is covered by contributions from   churches in the Western world, while it is with anxiety we note   that new laws are being prepared which will deprive the Council   of the right to administer its own funds. As already mentioned, racial discrimination   is by no means limited to South Africa. Before the Second World   War such discrimination was relatively common, and world opinion   was not particularly concerned with it. The situation changed,   however, after 1945: new ideas were expressed in the Atlantic   Charter and the Declaration of Human Rights.1 During the war it was possible to see signs   of a more liberal policy evolving in South Africa. The ideas from   the Atlantic Charter, however, had little effect there, and when   the Nationalist Party won the election of 1948 the situation   worsened. It was in this period that the apartheid laws were   formulated and ratified, a move which has correctly been   described as a counter-revolution against pre-1948   tendencies. History is never without a certain sense   for the ironic – the man who more than anyone else was   responsible for the implementation of the apartheid system, the   Nationalist Party’s first prime minister Dr. Daniel Malan, was a   churchman, an ordained priest in the Dutch Reformed Church. And   now we see that the most dynamic opponent of the apartheid system   is also a churchman – in fact a bishop! In this way history   corrects its own mistakes. The irony of history is even more   wide-ranging. The apartheid system is the indirect reason for the   fact that Desmond Tutu became a churchman with the position he   has today. His first wish was to become a doctor, but this was   impossible with his parents’ financial situation. He became,   therefore, a teacher – as his father had been. In 1957 when the   government introduced the state “Bantu education” – in many ways   an abolition of education for the black population – Tutu felt   himself driven from the teaching profession and began to study to   be a priest. He has himself said that he did not feel himself   called to take this step by high ideals, “it just occurred to me   that, if the Church would have me, the profession of priest could   be a good way of serving my people”. Yes – it seems that the Church was willing   to take him! Obviously, Desmond Tutu was not without   high ideals. And, like so many others, he had these ideals from   the family home. In his childhood in Klerksdorp in the West Rand   district he was taught tolerance and sympathy. He has himself   said that “I never learnt to hate”. The idealism of his parents   was thus reflected in Tutu’s upbringing. When Tutu was twelve years old his family   moved to Johannesburg, where his father was a teacher and his   mother a cleaner and cook at a school for the blind. Here he   learned sympathy for the weakest and most underprivileged. It was   also here that he met the man who probably exercised the   strongest influence over his formative years, the white priest   Trevor Huddleston, who was parish priest in the black slum of   Sophiatown. “One day”, says Tutu, “I was standing in the street   with my mother when a white man in a priest’s clothing walked   past. As he passed us he took off his hat to my mother. I   couldn’t believe my eyes – a white man who greeted a black   working class woman!” When Tutu has in later years been asked why   he doesn’t hate whites, he usually replies that it is because he   was fortunate in the whites he met when young. But, although he has never learnt to hate,   none has opposed injustice with a more burning anger. Courageous   and fearless he opposes his country’s authorities. He is to be   found at the front of the demonstration processions, regardless   of the danger to his own life. His clear standpoints and his   fearless attitude have made his name a unifying symbol for all   groups of freedom campaigners in Africa. Desmond Tutu has shown that to campaign for   the cause of peace is not a question of silent acceptance, but   rather of arousing consciences and a sense of indignation,   strengthening the will and inspiring the human spirit so that it   recognises both its own value and its power of victory. To this   fight for peace we give our affirmative “yes” today. The actress Liv Ullmann has told of a   Lebanese boy who was asked if he believed in revenge. “Yes”,   replied the boy, he believed in revenge. “And to revenge”, he was   asked, “what is that?” “To revenge”, replied the boy, “is to make   a bad person a good person.” Thoughts of this nature are the human   spirit’s bulwark against barbarism. It is those who have such   thoughts who are the real peacemakers and the meek, who are not   only blessed, but who shall also inherit the earth – also the   earth of South Africa. The 23 million coloured people shall at   least have the same right of inheritance of this earth as the 4.5   million whites. The question has been raised whether the   award of the Peace Prize to Desmond Tutu is to be seen as a   judgement on the South African apartheid system. The answer is   that the system has judged itself. Racial discrimination can   never be anything but an expression of shameful contempt for   humankind. Racial discrimination used and defended as a political   system is totally incompatible with human civilisation. This   year’s Peace Prize is therefore an attempt to awaken consciences.   It is, and has to be, an illusion that privileged groups can   maintain their position through repression. That such things can   have a place in our future is a lie which nobody should allow   themselves to believe. In his famous book Roots, the black   author Alex Hailey tells of his African ancestor, the negro slave   Kunta Kinte, who attained the position of coachman with his white   master. One of his duties was to drive his white masters to   luxurious parties held at neighbouring farms. One evening, as he   sat outside and waited, he began to philosophise over his   experiences. According to the author, he couldn’t understand that   such an unbelievable luxury really existed and that the whites   really lived the way they did. After a long time and many such   parties, he began to realise that the whites’ existence was, in a   remarkable way, unreal – a sort of beautiful dream built on a lie   which the whites told themselves: that good can come of evil, and   that it is possible to lead a civilised existence while not   acknowledging as human beings those whose sweat and blood made   their privileges possible. Kunta Kinte was right. Negro slavery was   incompatible with American civilisation – in the same way as the   apartheid system is in reality incompatible with South   African. There are few if any recorded examples in   history of privileged groups who voluntarily relinquish   privileges to the advantage of the repressed. In all probability   it won’t happen in South Africa either. The possibility of an   unbloody resolution of the conflict is nevertheless still there.   It is such a solution that Desmond Tutu fights for. The   presentation of the Peace Prize to him is, therefore, not a   judgement, rather it is a challenge, a hand stretched out – in   the same way as Desmond Tutu’s hand is stretched out to   conciliation and atonement. If only the dominant minority would   recognise this opportunity and take the chance before history’s   amnesty runs out. It will be understood that to present   Desmond Tutu’s Nobel Peace Prize with a white man’s hands is in   some ways an oppressive experience. On such an occasion it is   impossible not to allow one’s thoughts to consider what the white   man has prepetrated against his coloured cousins. It is   depressing to think of the list of debts which is written with   the African’s suffering, tears and blood. Think of the   humiliation and exploitation which human beings from this   continent have had to endure – from the first slave traffic,   through centuries of colonialism to today’s discrimination. On a   day like this our memories are indeed painful – not only on   account of what the white man has done and still does, but also   on account of what he, to this day, has neglected to do. Thus, as we now present the Nobel Peace   Prize to the African Desmond Tutu, our immediate feeling is that   our first word to the Prize Laureate ought to be a word   describing our sorrow over the wounds which injustice and racial   hatred has inflicted on his people. The dominating feeling is, however, one of   thankfulness and respectful joy, and this is because we feel   ourselves united with him in the belief in the creative power of   love. With his warmhearted Christian faith he is a representative   of the best in us all. Additionally, there is a factor which the   Nobel Committee has placed great emphasis on – that in the   liberation process which Desmond Tutu leads black and white stand   shoulder to shoulder in the common cause against injustice. In   this we see a moving confirmation of the words in Alfred Nobel’s   testament on the brotherhood of mankind. In the light of this we bring our homage to   Desmond Tutu. Because his struggle is – and has to be – our   struggle, we recognise him as a brother. He receives today the   Peace Prize as a sign of the thankfulness of millions – perhaps   also as an omen of black and white Africans’ final victory over   the last remnants of opposition in the campaign for freedom and   peace. It is appropriate to remember the words of Martin Luther   King just before his martyrdom: “I have seen the Promised   Land!” Even though the black South African’s way   forward to freedom’s promised land can still be long and   difficult, it is a way of humanity which we shall traverse   together in the sound knowledge that “we shall overcome”.   Therefore our first word to the Peace Prize laureate will be a   word of hope and victory: “oh yes, deep in my heart I do believe   that we shall overcome – some day!”"
"58","1985","International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War"," Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,    This year’s award of the Nobel Peace Prize gives us once again an   opportunity to reconsider a well known detail in the wording of   Alfred Nobel’s will. The prize, it is stated, is to be awarded to   the individual or group who has “done the most or the best work   for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of   standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace   congresses”.    What is especially important here is the way in which the   question of disarmament is given a direct relationship to the   attitudes of peoples and nations to one another. Brotherhood and   disarmament are two aspects of the same issue. Work aimed at   giving international relationships a quality of unity rather than   conflict can therefore be seen as a step on the way to a   bilateral and controlled disarmament.    Through this year’s award of the Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel   Committee wishes to emphasize this aspect of the struggle for   peace – to direct attention to the way in which the problem of   disarmament is a concern, not only of politicians, but also of   the general public in all countries.    No one can avoid being aware of the anxious interest shown in   this problem today, not least among children and young people.   The reason for this is obvious: with the development of atomic   weapons, the question of disarmament has been given a new   dimension, we could almost say, an eternal dimension. The   prevention of an outbreak of war is increasingly regarded as a   question of life or death for the human race.    It is in this connection that this year’s Peace Prize laureate,   the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War,   has, in the opinion of the Nobel Committee, made a commendable   contribution. In accordance with the ancient Hippocratic   Oath, which demands a dedication without compromise to the   protection of life and health, this organization has indicated,   using the evidence of medical science, the dangers to life and   health which atomic weapons represent. These physicians have told   us what will happen if these weapons were to be used. We know now   about the “atomic winter” with its destruction of the biosphere   and of all conditions necessary for life. The physicians have   also shown the absence of any escape route, and that there is no   feasible protection available against such an atomic catastrophe.   Home defence and medical services would inevitably collapse; it   would be impossible to help the injured and the dying, and   survivors would be subjected to the murderous long term   consequences.    Another aspect of this matter is that the resources which are   today used in the development of new weapons could have been used   to help the millions of people who die of hunger and lack of   adequate health care. What can be more true to the spirit of the   Hippocratic Oath than this campaign for new priorities in   the use of the available resources, from military ends to health   and other development causes?    Also, in this area, the International Physicians for the   Prevention of Nuclear War has presented an informative and   convincing documentation.    The Norwegian Nobel Committee believes that the organization in   this way has made an important contribution to activating the   general opposition to nuclear armaments and contributes therefore   to a mobilization of opinion which is now taking place all over   the world.    It is also true that the question of bilateral and controlled   reduction of nuclear arsenal has been offered a considerable   amount of attention at innumerable disarmament conferences. The   results have not been particularly encouraging. Possibly, the   former laureate, Alva Myrdal,   was correct in believing that all we can hope for now is a   stronger mobilization of public opposition and a corresponding   strengthening of pressure on the political authorities. However   that may be, a contribution to an increased public opposition to   the continued atomic arms-race can only be seen as a contribution   to the cause of peace. The International Physicians for the   Prevention of Nuclear War has, in the opinion of the Nobel   Committee, made such a contribution.    It is obvious that, if such a public opposition is to have real   value as a peace inducing force, it has to be built up   independently of ideological systems, political viewpoints or   geographical divisions. It has to be universal. One has to begin   with the simple fact that, faced with the threat of a nuclear   war, the whole of the world’s population is in the same boat. Or,   as Nikita Kruschev once expressed it: “After the first   exchange of atomic bombs, no one will be able to see the   difference between capitalist and communist ashes“.    Face to face with the threat of nuclear war, there is one common   interest which will assert itself over all others: the will to   survive. In other words, there is a common human interest in   preventing nuclear war. The feeling for this common interest is   now beginning to be so strong that a watchword seems to be   evolving: People of all lands who wish to survive, unite!    It is precisely in the light of the fact that this public opinion   has to be universal, that the Norwegian Nobel Committee regards   as particularly important the fact that the International   Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War is the result of a   common initiative from American and Soviet doctors. Together,   they have created a forum for cooperation which transcends   borders which are otherwise all too often sealed. Building on   their realistic evaluation of the situation, these physicians   have chosen to stand shoulder to shoulder and to work together in   a cooperation founded on trust and confidence. The Nobel   Committee believes this was a good decision.                This opinion is obviously shared by many. Although the organization                has only existed for five years, it now has active support from                physicians in more than forty countries all over the world. And                this support is growing. One thousand delegates from fifty countries                are expected to take part in next year’s annual congress which is                to be held in Cologne, West Germany. The organization has achieved                widespread recognition for its work. At the third annual congress                in Amsterdam, declarations of support were received from, among                others, the Secretary-General of the United                Nations and from Pope John Paul II, as well as from a number                of heads of government in both east and west. In 1984, the International                Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War was awarded UNESCO’s                “Peace Education Prize” “for its remarkable contribution to informing                public opinion and mobilizing the conscience of the human race in                the cause of peace“, as the citation stated.                The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War receives                active support from the World Health Organization, which acts as                distributor for the organization’s reports on the medical consequences                of nuclear explosions. From March of this year, the organization                has been recognized as a so-called “non-governmental organization”                officially connected to the World Health Organization. In a statement                from the WHO, the point is made that the prevention of an atomic                war is the most important task in the field of health politics,                a task which all physicians should have a duty to contribute to.    The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the International   Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War should be seen as   yet another recognition of a transnational contribution to the   cause of peace, coming from physicians who see it as their duty   to mobilize the strongest possible public opposition to atomic   annihilation.                It is permissible to wonder whether we don’t already know enough                about the terrible consequences of a nuclear war. The answer is,                of course, that we know more than enough. While visiting the Peace                Museum which the Japanese have erected on the spot where the first                atomic bomb fell forty years ago, however, I came across the following                epitaph: “We know 100 times more than we need to know. What we                lack is the ability to experience and to be moved by what we know,                what we understand and what we see and believe“.    One can see that this epitaph touches the heart of the matter. A   theoretic knowledge of the megaton-bomb’s explosive power is not   enough. It isn’t enough to be frightened to sleeplessness by   fiction films on the atomic Ragnarock. The question is: What   shall we do about it? Do we have the ability to begin to act? Is   it possible to force a change of direction? This is the question   which has become our time’s “to be or not to be”.    Albert Einstein   wrote, in connection with the development of atomic weapons,   “We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if   mankind is to survive“.    The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War   has, in addition to its information work, attempted to create   such a new way of thinking. Here, again, it is apposite to recall   the way in which Nobel’s will emphasizes the connection between   the problem of disarmament and the peoples’ attitude to one   another.    All the many bloody chapters in the history of mankind tell us of   this connection. It starts when groups of peoples and nations   begin to regard each other as enemies. In time, each side   considers the oppositions to be evil incarnate. The enemy has   become a monster capable of unscrupulously attacking and   destroying. History, especially European history, has,   unfortunately, far too many examples of this philosophy’s   self-fertilizing effect.    What sort of results would this philosophy have today? With the   murderous potential the various groups now have control over, we   have to conclude that the need for a new direction is now   categorical, or, as Einstein said, “it is now a question of   life or death for mankind“.    Alongside the atomic weapons, a new reality has been created,   based on the fact that an atomic war cannot be won. It is no   longer possible to solve problems through a power-political   confrontation. And, if a war were to be begun, the question of   who was to blame would be totally uninteresting afterwards. The   world’s conflicts would have found what Hitler called “the final   solution”.    Is it possible to find a responsible politician who desires such   a solution? Obviously not. We have to believe all politicians who   declare that this is precisely what we must avoid. Because it is   the truth.    The riddle is, of course, to explain why the arms race continues.   How is it possible, in a world ravaged by famine, poverty and   sickness, that anyone has the conscience to use more than 800   million dollars a year on armaments?    The explanation is simple. The reason is fear, a fear created and   kept alive by the well-known “enemy philosophy” which, more or   less, consciously, sets its mark on both ideas and attitudes.   Nobody dares to take the risk of relying on the other side.   Without this bilateral fear, it would be difficult to find any   rational argument for the build-up of armaments. Nobody with any   knowledge of the information and propaganda which support our   age’s balance of terror can be in doubt: the driving force behind   the arms race is the two sides’ fear and lack of confidence in   one another. The extent to which this lack of confidence is   promoted as a political doctrine is an indicator of the dangerous   nature of today’s world as a place in which to live one’s   life.    Another aspect of the same picture is the fact that, from time to   time, things are both said and done which can easily be   interpreted as confirmation of the doubts the various parties   have of one another. As a general rule, we have a tendency to   believe the enemy when he says something which confirms our   suspicions. If he, on the other hand, says something which   indicates that he is interested in peace and friendship, it is   argued that we would be stupid to believe him, as his intention   is to give us a false sense of security in order to be able to   destroy us all the more easily.    It is easy to see how such a mode of thinking creates problems   for arms reduction negotiations. The result is all too well   known. For our own security’s sake we have to have more weapons   because we cannot trust the opposition, and they have to have at   least as many weapons because they cannot trust us. And thereby,   the evil circle is made whole.    Meanwhile, fear and insecurity grow in all countries, and   resources which could have been used in the fight against famine   and sickness are used to further increase an arsenal which was   more than big enough before.    It was once fashionable to talk about “the inevitable conflict”.   It is universally accepted today that such an argumentation   cannot be maintained. The unavoidable truth is that our little   planet could not survive an atomic war. Nobody today dares to   think of an atomic confrontation as unavoidable.    This makes the question which is being raised in more and more   countries even more urgent. Why do we develop more and more   sophisticated atomic weapons when we know that each new   development makes their use seem even more absurd? There is, of   course, no political or ideological objective which can justify   the use of such weapons, for who would be able to enjoy the   fruits of our wonderful political or ideological systems if the   price of their introduction is a common annihilation?    Among all the complications which abound in our world, there   remains one simple fact: we have the choice between living   together or ceasing to live at all. Irrespective of what we call   ourselves or to which political philosophy we subscribe, it is   this reality which has to be the starting point for our thoughts   and actions, that is, if we want to survive. This is becoming   increasingly more recognized. We have to assume that the fear of   atomic war and the will to prevent it is just as strong in all   human beings, wherever in the world they live. The absurdity of   the atomic arms race is ever more apparent and its necessity ever   more doubtful. It ought to be simple to argue that resources   ought to be diverted to causes like health care or used for the   benefit of those in need.    The creation of a new way of thinking and acting based on this   common opinion ought not to be too difficult.    It is regrettable that the world is divided in the way we know it   is. It is just as regrettable that atomic weapons were ever   invented. This is, however, the unfortunate reality with which we   have to live. The technological development or weapons cannot be   reversed, and it is even questionable that our divided world can   be united through a power-political confrontation. It is in the   light of this reality that we have to define our own involvement,   and it is this reality which now presents humankind with a   decisive test. Nobody can opt out by resorting to the easy excuse   that it is the other side which is responsible, and that it is   their philosophy and actions which make ours an unfortunate   necessity. The problem is that those on the other side reason in   precisely the same way. The fear which oppresses mankind today is   the possibility that both sides are right, and that we can begin   to build the future on the basis of a strategy which would be   disastrous precisely at the moment it showed itself to be   correct.    It is in the light of this reality that we have to regard the   engagement in the cause of peace which has been shown by the   International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.    The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not regard the evaluation of   this organization’s, or any other’s, concrete proposals for   disarmament to be part of its duties. The committee is primarily   interested in the way in which International Physicians for the   Prevention of Nuclear War has directed its efforts towards the   brotherhood which is the key to the problem of disarmament. A   forum has been created where discussions and actions can be   raised out of ideological blind alleys. The organization has   recognized the consequences of the fact that only by uniting in a   common cause today is it possible to make even things that are   impossible today, possible tomorrow.    In the opinion of the Nobel Committee, the International   Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War has shown that this   is a feasible course. And it is our duty to believe that the   cause of peace can only be promoted through common interests and   brotherhood.    The Nobel Peace Prize has, especially in later years, often been   awarded to campaigners for human rights. The Committee has   followed, and still follows, the fate of these prizewinners with   interest, but also in the hope that the concept of human value   they represent will be successful and will be consummated in the   universal recognition of the freedom which is every human being’s   birthright.    This year’s prize is more concerned with the problem of   disarmament, but is also, at a deeper level, concerned with human   rights – perhaps even the most fundamental human right of them   all – the right to live. The right to a life and a future for us   all, for our children and for our grandchildren. Yes, it is   concerned with the unborn generations’ right to inherit that   earth which we today tend on their behalf.    It is in the light of this fundamental right of man that the   organization International Physicians for the Prevention of   Nuclear War has chosen its course. And, as it now receives the   Peace Prize, it is in recognition of a constructive work in the   cause of peace. But the prize also expresses a hope – a hope for   the steady advance of a new way of thinking, so that bridges can   be built over the chasms that represent our fear of the   future.    Mankind in all countries is united in that hope."
"59","1986","Elie Wiesel"," Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,    It is today exactly 50 years since the Nobel Peace Prize was   awarded to the German public figure and pacifist, Carl von   Ossietzky.1 That particular   award was one of the most controversial ever made. The newly   established Nazi regime in Germany was violently critical of the   Norwegian Nobel Committee, and German citizens were forbidden to   accept Nobel prizes in the future. This type of reaction was in a way so   predictable that it can be ignored. What we ought to be more   interested in, on the other hand, is the type of reaction which   came from countries other than Germany. Many were of course   delighted, but there were also many commentators who were   sceptical. Leading figures in politics and the press expressed   the opinion that Ossietzky was too extreme in his warnings and   revelations. Some believed him to be a communist. In any case, it   was argued, the cause of peace was poorly served by a Peace Prize   which seemed to be a direct provocation of the German   government. The existence of such reactions was   obviously partly a result of judging the Hitler regime by current   political and moral criteria. Most people were, in contrast to   Ossietzky, unable to recognise the deadly threat to democracy   which was developing. When the threat was at last recognised   people were more or less paralysed by the “Hitler-roar”, and had   few resources to fight it with, other than the almost desperate   appeasement politics represented by Chamberlain. During Nazism’s   formative years the general attitude was one of unsuspicious   ambivalence. Of course one disagreed with Hitler, but when is one   not in disagreement with politicians? And of course one was aware   of the terrible rumours about the brownshirts’ atrocities, but   wasn’t it necessary to evaluate this against the background of   the extraordinary situation in the country? At least there was   now a strong and active government, and Hitler was of course a   democratically elected leader… Most people feared some sort of   unavoidable catastrophe. But only a few suspected the extent of   what was happening – and it is precisely because of this   blindness that the catastrophe was allowed to happen. Ibsen’s   buttonmaker was proved right once again: “…it’s when insight is   lacking that the fellow with the hoof takes his best prey”. Carl von Ossietzky had insight. He has the   courage and ability to tell of what he saw, and therefore acted   as an unafraid witness for truth and justice. All honour to the   then Nobel Committee for awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize. His   testimony was, however, also his doom – Ossietzky did not survive   his meeting with the terrible regime which had established itself   in the heart of Europe. Today, fifty years later, the Peace Prize   is to be presented to one who survived. In 1945, on the ashes   left behind after the sacrificial flames which annihilated six   million Jews, sat the seventeen-year-old Elie Wiesel, an only son   of Abraham, an Isaac who once again had escaped a sacrificial   death on Mount Moriah at the last moment. He will receive the   Nobel Peace Prize today because he, too, has become a witness for   truth and justice. From the abyss of the death camps he has come   as a messenger to mankind – not with a message of hate and   revenge, but with one of brotherhood and atonement. He has become   a powerful spokesman for the view of mankind and the unlimited   humanity which is, at all times, the basis of a lasting peace.   Elie Wiesel is not only the man who survived – he is also the   spirit which has conquered. In him we see a man who has climbed   from utter humiliation to become one of our most important   spiritual leaders and guides. The Nobel Committee believes it is vital   that we have such guides in an age when terror, repression, and   racial discrimination still exist in the world. With today’s presentation of the Peace   Prize, a bridge is built between the German who gave his life in   the fight against what he saw was going to happen and the Jew who   has dedicated his life to fighting anything that could lead to a   recurrence of that same tragedy. It is appropriate that there is   a Nobel Peace Prize at both ends of that bridge. Elie Wiesel was born on the 30th of   September 1928 in the Romanian town of Sighet in the Carpathians.   He and his three sisters grew up in a peaceful family which was   strongly bound by Jewish traditions and the Jewish religion. Elie   was fourteen years old when the deportation of Hungarian Jews   began. Sighet was now occupied by Hungary, and the town’s Jewish   population was packed, in the usual humiliating way, into goods   wagons and transported to Auschwitz. There he saw his mother and   youngest sister sent to the gas chambers. Later, his father died   while being transported to Buchenwald. Through his books Elie Wiesel has given us   not only an eyewitness account of what happened, but also an   analysis of the evil powers which lay behind the events. His main   concern is the question of what measures we can take to prevent a   recurrence of these events. The terrors he encountered in the death   camps, which were slowly revealed to the rest of the world, were   something which was qualitatively new in the history of mankind.   The Holocaust was a war within a war, a world in itself, a   kingdom of darkness where there existed an evil so monstrous that   it shattered all political and moral codes. It represented a new   dimension. According to its theoretical basis, which could only   have been the product of sick minds, it was a capital offence to   belong to a certain race! This was previously unimaginable, but   now the unimaginable was happening. It is true that previous regimes had used   brutal punishment against real or imagined opponents, but behind   such measures there was always an element of logical – though   perverted – reasoning. The punishment was the result of some   injury or offence, either actual or potential. But for the Jews – and, to a certain   extent, the Romanies – the situation was different. Among the   relics of the Nazi regime have been found registration forms used   when arresting Jews. The usual details were noted down: name,   age, sex, religion, address, and, of course, reason for arrest.   In the last case only one word was entered, the word   JEW. The enormity of what happened is thus not   only the sheer number of the victims; it is not only the   existence of factory-like slaughter houses. No, the enormity lies   in the philosophy which made this “industry” possible! It is this   that Elie Wiesel wants us to understand. His mission is not to   gain the world’s sympathy for the victims or the survivors. His   aim is to awaken our conscience. Our indifference to evil makes   us partners in the crime. That is the reason for his attack on   indifference and his insistence on measures aimed at preventing a   new holocaust. We know that the unimaginable has happened. What   are we doing now to prevent it happening again? Do not forget, do   not sink into a new blind indifference, but involve yourselves in   truth and justice, in human dignity, freedom, and atonement. That   is this Peace Prize laureate’s message to us. Elie Wiesel’s sojourn in the death camps   ended in Buchenwald in the spring of 1945, when the prisoners   were liberated by American troops. Together with a group of other   Jewish children he was sent to France. His stay in France was   part convalescence, part study: he learnt French and studied at   the Sorbonne before becoming a correspondent with a Tel Aviv   newspaper. He travelled to the USA as a journalist, became a   correspondent with a New York Jewish paper, and took American   citizenship in 1963. In the meantime he had published a number of   books, of which Night (1956) was the first. His writings,   which have been translated into many languages, now include   twenty-six full-length books, together with a large number of   articles, essays, and lectures. He has been awarded a number of   honours and prizes. Elie Wiesel is an honorary professor at   City College in New York and has, in addition, a professorship in   humanities at Boston University. He is the leader of the American   Holocaust Commission instigated by the President of the USA.   Biographical details are perhaps unnecessary in Elie Wiesel’s   case – he is best presented through his own writings and through   his actions in pursuit of his call. Naturally enough, it was his own people’s   fate which formed the starting point for his involvement. During   the years, however, his message has attained a universal   character. Presented as it is in different variations and in   different contexts, it stands now as communication from one human   being to humankind. Its involvement is limitless, and encompasses   all who suffer, wherever they might be. The fight for freedom and   human dignity – whether in Latin America, Asia, Europe or South   Africa – has become his life’s purpose. This involvement is based on a strong   feeling of duty to the lessons which history teaches us. It has   been said that peoples or cultures who forget their history are   doomed to repeat it, and it is against the background of his own   experiences that Elie Wiesel now warns us of this. We cannot   allow ourselves to forget the fate of those who died. If we do   forget, we commit them to death once again, and become   responsible ourselves for making their lives – and their deaths –   meaningless. This warning has also a future perspective: we must   not allow the unsuspicious ambivalence to return and open the way   for an atomic holocaust. We cannot allow ourselves to be deluded   into believing that the unthinkable will not happen. For it has   happened once before. History has warned us. The duty and responsibility which Elie   Wiesel preaches are not primarily concerned with the fear of the   terrors of the past repeating themselves. It is much more an   engagement directed at preventing the possible victory of evil   forces in the future. The creative force in this process is not   hate and revenge, but rather a longing for freedom, a love of   life and a respect for human dignity. Or as Elie Wiesel has said   himself: “I will conquer our murderers by attempting to   reconstruct what they destroyed”. No, Elie Wiesel’s standpoint is not   characterised by a passive obsession with a tragic history;   rather it is a reconstructed belief in God, humanity, and the   future. And it is truly a belief which is both hard-won and   tested. Elie Wiesel sat thus in the ashes after   Auschwitz. The storm and fire had terrorised his life. Everything   was in ruins. His family was annihilated. Two of his sisters were   alive, though he was not aware of this at the time. He was   homeless and without a fatherland. Even his identity as a human   being was undermined – he was now prisoner number A 7713, a sort   of shipwrecked sailor on a burnt coast, without hope, without a   future. Only the naked memories remained. And, like Job in the   ashes, he sat there and questioned his God – cast his agonised   “WHY?” towards heaven: Why did this have to happen? And why   should I have survived? Dear God, why were six million of your   own chosen people sent to their deaths? Where were you when they   hanged twelve-year-olds in Auschwitz, or burned small children   alive in Birkenau? He was seventeen years old, and how could a   life be lived after what had happened? The sorrow was so great,   and the experience of life so bitter. Indeed, he was only   seventeen, but was already the lonely prophet of the   Lamentations: “Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?   Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow”. But he was alive. And in time it occurred   to him that there could be a purpose behind it – that he was to   be a witness, the one who would pass on the account of what had   happened so that the dead would not have died in vain and so that   the living could learn. The problem was that the story was   impossible to tell. No human being could accurately describe the   terror which existed in the death camps. To tell could thus   easily become a betrayal of the dead. But to remain silent would   be an even greater betrayal. He remained silent for ten years. Then his   profession as a journalist brought him into contact with the   French poet and Nobel prizewinner, Francois Mauriac.   This meeting led him to break his silence – at first with Night   and then in the course of very short time with Dawn, The   Accident, The Town Beyond the Wall, The Gates of the Forest,   the play Zalmen, A Beggar in Jerusalem, and his credo   Ani Maamin – “I believe”. All Elie Wiesel’s books and publications   are concerned with the same theme – the Holocaust is present in   them all. As he himself says: “You can get out of Auschwitz, but   Auschwitz can never get out of you”. But, even though the theme   is always the same, and even though the same story is repeated   time after time, there is always a new approach which opens up   new perspectives. There is a remarkable development in Wiesel’s   authorship. We see a forward looking development in a human being   who regains his upright position and his individual identity. In the beginning everything is night and   dark, On the last page of Night he stands in front of the   mirror and sees a face which is like a bleached skull. Even in   Dawn the day doesn’t dawn – the whole book is a fight with   the darkness of night. The problem is constantly the same painful   question: “How can one live a meaningful life under the weight of   such agonising memories?” Is the German philosopher correct in   stating that memory is in the service of everlasting agony? Was   there no way forward to day and to light? The answer comes slowly. We meet the first   intimation of dawn in The Town Beyond the Wall where two   prisoners, one of whom is mad and the other dumb, manage to find   a means by which they can communicate with one another. The dumb   prisoner breaks his silence and the lunatic shows that he perhaps   isn’t so insane after all. They build a relationship which is a   salvation for both of them. The same thought is developed in   The Gate of the Forest and A Beggar in Jerusalem,   and, as the books progress, the light becomes brighter. The man   raises himself up. The spirit conquers. The answer to the riddle   of the night is not hate based on what has happened, but a   believing and hopeful rebirth into future events. This is what he   calls The Refound Song which appears in his credo, his   Ani Maamin: I believe in God – in spite of God! I believe in   Mankind – in spite of Mankind! I believe in the Future – in spite   of the Past! And with this hard-won belief he stands   forward today with his message to all people on this earth. This   is a message which not only awakens our conscience, but also   inspires a limitless solidarity where individuals find one   another in the labor of building a “Town Beyond the Wall” for the   future – beyond the wall of evil and dark memories. It is on account of this inspiration that   Elie Wiesel has so successfully reached out with his message. I   doubt whether any other individual, through the use of such quiet   speech, has achieved more or been more widely heard. The words   are not big, and the voice which speaks them is low. It is a   voice of peace we hear. But the power is intense. Truly, the   little spark will not be put out, but will become a burning torch   for our common belief in the future. Truly, prisoner number A   7713 has become a human being once again – a human being   dedicated to humanity. And, once again, we have met the young Jew   at the ford Jabbok in the book of Genesis – he who in the   darkness of night wrestled with God, he who refused to release   his opponent before his opponent blessed him and who left that   place at dawn marked for life on his hip. It was to this man that   the promise of the future was made from on high: “Thy name shall   be called… Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and   with men, and hast prevailed”. It is in recognition of this particular   human spirit’s victory over the powers of death and degradation,   and as a support to the rebellion of good against the evil in the   world, that the Norwegian Nobel Committee today presents the   Nobel Peace Prize to Elie Wiesel. We do this on behalf of   millions – from all peoples and races. We do it in deep reverence   for the memory of the dead, but also with the deep felt hope that   the prize will be a small contribution which will forward the   cause which is the greatest of all humanity’s concerns – the   cause of peace."
"60","1987","Oscar Arias Sánchez"," Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,    This year’s Peace Prize, one of the six Nobel Prizes which are to   be presented today, is primarily a homage and an expression of   thanks to Oscar Arias Sánchez for the praiseworthy work he   has done in the cause of attaining a lasting peace in Central   America. Few regions of the world have had worse   experiences of civil war and conflict during recent years.   Insecurity, repression, lack of freedom and poverty have long   been a part of everyday life for the majority of the 25 million   people who live in the area. For these people there is now a hope. On   the 7th of August this year the presidents of Nicaragua, El   Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica signed a peace plan   for Central America. The Norwegian Nobel Committee believes that   this plan opens the way for a development which can replace   bloody conflict with an open, trusting society. The main architect behind this plan is this   year’s prizewinner, the President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias. He   stands today as the strongest exponent of the longing for peace   among the peoples of Central America. He is also an exponent of   the democratic ideals which, if they can be realised, are a   decisive precondition for a long-lasting peace. This is the   reason that the plan is a signpost in the work for peace the   whole world over. Victor Hugo said that “nothing is stronger   than an idea when the time is ripe”. We must believe that the   time is now ripe for precisely the idea which has manifested   itself in the Central American peace plan. Oscar Arias is one of   those who had the vision to recognise this. The fact that the   plan is the result of a cooperation between the five signatory   states indicates that there is in fact a general recognition that   the time is ripe. The Peace Prize to Oscar Arias is therefore to   be interpreted as a recognition also of the work of the other   heads of state and their work with the plan. Oscar Arias is, at the age of 46, a   relatively young Peace Prize laureate. It is probable that the   bulk of his life’s work is still to be done. But what he has   already achieved indicates that he is one of the most important   leaders in Latin America. He has the personal and theoretical   background as well as the necessary experience to continue the   work for peace which has been started in the area. He began his political career seriously in   1970 at the age of 29, when he became an assistant to former   President José Figueres, who was seeking re-election. The   election campaign was successful. Figueres won the election in   1970, and Oscar Arias became a member of the government – as   minister for national planning and political economy. In 1978   Arias was elected to the national assembly as a representative   for the National Liberty party. At that time he was the party’s   international secretary, and from 1979 he was also its general   secretary. In 1985 he was nominated as his party’s   candidate for the presidency, and at the election the year after   he became president. It is probably not a coincidence that it is   the president of Costa Rica who has become the principal force   behind the work for peace in Central America. The country is in   many ways a haven of peace in an area which unfortunately has   been anything but peaceful. Even during the period of Spanish   colonialism there was something special about Costa Rica. The   country was not, as the name would suggest, a rich country. There   was nothing there which could make the place interesting for gold   prospectors or other fortune seekers. The country was too small   for the establishment of large, profitable land holdings – the   settlers in the first colony took enough land to secure their   daily bread, and they worked themselves on the land. Slavery was   neither necessary nor affordable. Even the founder of the colony   was an ordinary, hardworking farmer. In this way Costa Rica avoided the   formation of a rich upper class of landowners with power over a   landless and poverty-stricken majority – a pattern which is often   found in the Third World. The small population – in 1821 there   were only 65,000 – was thus mainly composed of land-owning small   farmers. The population was also homogeneous – both   culturally and economically – and since the country was also   relatively isolated from the bureaucratic, centralized Spanish   administration, it developed a strong and resilient attitude   towards freedom and independence. In other words, the country was   an ideal centre for democratic traditions. When Costa Rica became an independent   republic at the beginning of the 1830s, the transition was made   without the use of weapons or the shedding of blood. Throughout   its whole history the use of military power has been unnecessary,   and the country can be proud of having had a stable democratic   system which has lasted since the 1890s. This has set its mark on the country until   the present time. After a short armed uprising in 1948 a new   constitution was decreed. It declared that Costa Rica would be a   country without a military force. Whatever one might think of   such a body, one has to accept that the willingness to abolish it   shows an interest in peace which is relatively unusual in this   world. Even though the country has armed guards at   its borders, it is still without military forces in the usual   sense of the word. It has been said that Costa Rica has more   school teachers than soldiers. Some have even claimed that the   country’s artillery wouldn’t even be able to fire a twenty-one   gun salute in the event of a state visit, though this particular   detail might now have been corrected. It has also been said that   the country’s two main products are good coffee and good and   upright people. In truth a praiseworthy form of production. The civil authorities in Costa Rica have   traditionally given priority to investment in the education   system, health and economic development. The result is that Costa   Rica is exceptional in the area also with regard to economic   growth and social equality. This is true even though Costa Rica   has considerable economic problems as a result of the lower price   of coffee and the rising price of oil in the decade from the   mid-1970s. Costa Rica’s central role in the peace   process in Central America has its background in the country’s   democratic traditions. A positive turn in this work occurred in   1983 when the so-called Contadora group presented its 21-point   preliminary agenda for a peace plan. The group was composed of   Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Panama, and the plan included   Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica. It   had also been approved by the leaders of these five countries   before it was made public. For reasons too complicated to present   here, the Contadora plan did not result in the planned peace   treaty. But it did awaken interest and did receive support –   especially from Western Europe and Canada. The Reagan   administration announced that the plan was “the best foundation   for a lasting solution of the problems in the area”. But the Contadora plan became a political   backwater, while the military activity in the area grew. When Oscar Arias became President of Costa   Rica, he immediately began working on the completion of the   Contadora group’s intentions. Together with the presidents of   Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras he worked on a new   peace plan which was finally signed in August this year. In   principle, this plan is based on the same ideas as the Contadora   plan, but the proposals are more definite. They are based on,   among other things, a concurrent ceasefire in the civil wars of   Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, an amnesty for all guerilla   soldiers, the abolition of the state of emergency, the release of   political prisoners and the establishment of freedom of the press   and a democratic form of government. There are two things about this plan which   are particularlyworth commenting on. The first is that the plan   is the five signatory states’ own plan – conceived and signed   without involvement or pressure from outside. This is important,   not least because it expresses a particular view of the situation   in Central America – the view that the conflicts are an internal   problem for the region, and that they are a result of the   existing social and economic injustices. As so often in the Third World, it is a   question of injustice in the relationship between the big   landowners and the poor landless. In addition it is a question of   a brutal use of power against any form of opposition, and of a   minority government which discriminates without mercy. This is   once again the sad story of the privileged minorities who resist   the demands of the poor for justice with armed resistance. And as   always, this results in the release of revolutionary forces. When   the authorities then react with repeated repression instead of   political and social reforms, the result can never be anything   other than conflict – perhaps it ought never to be anything   else. The Central American Peace Plan addresses   itself to a different sort of problem. The intention is clear:   since the conflict is the result of problems within the five   states, it is the five states themselves who have to solve the   problems. It is in accordance with this principle that the plan   suggests that all outside help to the opposition forces has to   cease. The peace plan’s message in this connection can only be   interpreted in one way: outside powers must – if they will serve   the cause of peace in the area, stop any actions which can   contribute to keeping the never-ending civil war alive. The   combatting groups need help – help to change the underlying   circumstances which are the root cause of the conflict. It has been suggested that peace and   stability have to be established before any reforms can be made.   The weakness of this argument, even if it can be regarded as   correct, is that efforts to create stability can be a support for   the power groups who oppose reform; the process would therefore   strengthen the revolutionary situation. The solution is obviously to be found in   the doctrine that the imbalances which are at the root of the   conflict have to be changed. If that is successful, it will be   possible to establish peace and stability based on a foundation   acceptable to the people themselves. This is the reality all   outside parties have to accept. This leads us to the other remarkable   aspect of the peace plan: the principle of the intimate   relationship between peace and democracy. Already in the speech he held at his   inauguration as Costa Rica’s president Oscar Arias made this   principle a major point. Our experience, he said, has taught us   that democracy is the form of government which gives the greatest   possibilities for a future anchored on justice. Government   through the decisions of correctly elected organs is the only way   to a liberation from poverty and dependence. What Oscar Arias is saying is that   democracy is something more than a form of government. It is in   reality an important tool in the work for peace. We have to accept, however unwillingly –   and independently of how old our own democratic traditions are –   that the principle of majority rule is not perfect. In a number   of areas we are only on the way towards the goals we have set   ourselves. But democracy has the obvious advantage that it makes   possible the further development of democracy. And because this   is the case, we have also achieved goals which newly established   democracies around the world can only dream of. It is important   to have this historical perspective before us when we evaluate   the quality of the young democracies. They have their difficult   path to tread, just as we had. The present situation in Central America   gives us hope because democracy has been given a chance. Democracy is, in contrast to totalitarian   regimes, dependent on support from the people. This support is in   its turn dependent on the experiences of the people. As long as   democracy can be identified with free elections, freedom of   expression, with honest measures for social justice and with a   moderate improvement in economic status, the positive development   can continue with the people’s support. The future of democracy will be dependent   on the realisation of a minimum of the people’s expectations. It   can be difficult to accept the overturning of a dictatorship if   the system which replaces it brings with it lack of freedom,   corruption and injustice. Government by the people makes demands –   both on the individuals who govern and on the people who elect   their leaders. There are demands for moral qualities, and there   have to be ideals which nobody can reasonably deny. With this as a background it is easy to see   why the Central American peace plan is so strongly rooted in the   connection between peace and democracy. Peace will be realised if   democracy is realised. In this way the peace plan is something   more than a dream and a hope. It is a powerful challenge – not   only to the leaders of the five countries, but also to all of us.   If we have anything to contribute which can affect the   development of this area let it be a contribution to social and   economic liberation and to the growth of a government by the   people which is, in Central America as elsewhere, one of the keys   to peace. The award of the Peace Prize usually has   two goals. This is particularly true this year. The prize to   Oscar Arias is a recognition of an achieved result – the peace   plan. It sets its sights also on the future and is a moral   support in the work for peace which is based on that plan. The   Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes, after much thought, to place   the prestige of the Nobel Peace Prize in the scale to the   advantage of those who struggle for democracy, for justice, for   development and for the natural rights of the peoples in their   countries. Oscar Arias is one of the foremost of those   who strive to achieve those goals. His name is today a focal   point in the work for peace which is anchored in the will of the   people and in respect for human rights. It is the Nobel   Committee’s hope that the Peace Prize will contribute to his   success in the symbolic building dedicated to peace which is now   being raised for the war-weary people of Central America."
"61","1988","United Nations Peacekeeping Forces"," Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:    The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations   Peacekeeping Forces is unfortunately a reminder to us that peace   is not a matter of course here in our world. Peace has to be   actively protected – and this protection has its price. 733 young   people have sacrificed their lives in the service of the   particular form of peacekeeping which is under consideration   here. The Norwegian Nobel Committee asks those   gathered together here today to join them in honouring the memory   of those young people. They came from different countries and had   widely different backgrounds, but they were united in one thing:   they were willing to devote their youth and their energy to the   service of peace. They volunteered to the service, knowing that   it could involve risk. It became their lot to pay the highest   price a human being can pay. We honour them for their unselfish   contribution, and we join their relatives in their sorrow over   their loved ones’ early departure. Let us show this through a   moment’s silence. We invoke peace on the memory of these   young people in a spirit of thankfulness and deep respect. For the first time in its history, the   Peace Prize is to be awarded today to an organisation which, at   least in part, consists of military forces. It might be   reasonable to ask whether this is, in fact, in direct   contradiction to the whole idea of the Peace Prize. The fact that   this question has not been raised is an indication that it is   universally accepted that the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces   are in the spirit of the Peace Prize. The description “Forces” is in itself   inadequate since it conjures up the idea of a military operation   in the traditional sense, while the reality is in many ways the   diametric opposite. A more correct description would be “The   United Nations Peacekeeping Operation” – consisting of both   contingents of troops and unarmed observation corps. These peacekeeping operations were   commenced in 1956 when the UNEF (United Nations Emergency Force)   was established in connection with the Suez crisis. The Security   Council was unable to act because of a veto from two of the   member states. Instead, use was made of the so-called “Uniting   for Peace” resolution which gives the General Assembly of the   United Nations the power to intervene in the event of the   Security Council being unable to act in the face of a threat to   world peace. The General Assembly was summoned to a   special session. In the following events, important roles were   played by two prominent individuals: the former foreign minister   of Canada, Lester   Pearson, and the then Secretary-General of the United   Nations, Dag   Hammarskjöld. Both of these men were later awarded the   Nobel Peace Prize. Through the influence of these two, plans   were made and a resolution passed for a peacekeeping force which   was to supervise the retreat of foreign troops from the canal   zone. The principles which were defined for this   peace operation were written, in the main, by Dag   Hammarskjöld. It is an honour to his memory that the same   guidelines are, generally speaking, in use today. The most important points in these   guidelines are: 1. The involved parties must give their support and     cooperation to the United Nations forces.      2. The primary aim is to prevent new hostilities and provide a     background against which it is possible to work for a peaceful     solution of the conflict.      3. The force is to make use of negotiation and persuasion     instead of violence.      4. The force is under the command of the leadership of the     United Nations and is not allowed to accept orders from other     parts, not even the states who have made the troops     available.      5. All member nations should contribute to the financing of the     forces. The peacekeeping forces have, on the basis   of the resolution of 1956 and the guidelines drawn up by Dag   Hammarskjöld, developed into what present Secretary-General   Perez de Cuéllar calls “The United Nations’ most successful   renewal”. Strangely enough, the peacekeeping forces   as such were a new creation: they are not named – or even   envisaged – in the original United Nations treaty. The treaty   does mention the possibility of military involvement on the part   of the United Nations in the event of hostilities, but, because   of the relationship between the great powers, it has never been   possible to make use of this part of the treaty – the possible   exception being the action in Korea in 1950. Today’s peacekeeping operations are   something quite different. The troops are made available on a   voluntary basis and are approved by the Security Council. They   are stationed in areas where a ceasefire has already been   established but where no formal peace treaty has been concluded,   and they are stationed in such a way that the conflicting   parties, in the event of a resumption of hostilities, would meet   the United Nations troops first. Actual fighting can thus be   avoided, peace and quiet maintained, and it is possible to   develop an atmosphere which makes active peace work possible. The   very presence of the United Nations troops can have a positive   effect. The soldiers very often make friends among the local   population, they can offer help and aid in many ways, and are a   conciliating element in otherwise explosive situations. In this connection it is interesting to   note a parallel with one of the ideas Alfred Nobel worked on –   following a model from the French duelling etiquette. The seconds   in such a conflict could intervene between the combatants with   the aim of achieving a delay in the duel so that tempers could be   cooled and the whole business possibly solved by other means. It is perhaps reasonable that there were   powerful political objections to this model, but the point   remains: the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces today have just   such an “interventionist” role. Because the United Nations is, in   this way, on speaking terms with both parts, negotiations which   are at a standstill can perhaps be reopened, and in many   situations it is possible that armed fighting can be avoided. The English brigadier, Michael Harbottle,   who took part in the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces in Cyprus   at the end of the 1960’s, has written a book on his experiences   there. The book is called The Impartial Soldier, and in it   he relates an episode which illustrates what the United Nations   peacekeeping operations mean better than any official report. The Finnish contingent under the command of   Colonel Uolevi Koskenpalo was involved in the episode. A message   was received to the effect that the Turks had begun to dig   trenches in a suspicious manner; the Greeks had observed this,   under the leadership of a general, they had decided to take the   affair into their own hands. Colonel Koskenpalo had, however,   placed his three platoons in precisely the right strategic   position, so that the Greeks met the Finnish United Nations   troops first as intended. The Greek general disliked being   hindered in this way and began to protest loudly. In fact he   screamed at the Finn – an obvious mistake. In contrast to the   Greek, Colonel Koskenpalo was a well built man with a chest and   shoulders of Nordic dimensions. He advanced slowly and from a   height of well over six feet looked down at the Greek and said in   a moderately loud voice, “Don’t shout, general. I am a colonel in   the Finnish army and don’t like being shouted at.” The reaction was surprising. The general   naturally didn’t believe his ears, but the shouting stopped   immediately and in a little while he retreated together with his   forces. This gave the Finn the opportunity to both inform and   placate the Greek high command and to persuade the Turks to stop   the provocative trench digging. In this way a violent episode was avoided.   There have been many similar episodes where the United Nations   Peacekeeping Forces have intervened. It is a question of a   strictly peaceful behaviour combined with authority. The Finnish   colonel was able to act as an efficient peace medium because he   had the authority of the United Nations and the force of his   well-trained Finnish United Nations soldiers behind him. What has been said about the United Nations   Peacekeeping Forces is equally true of the United Nations   observers. Their duties are to ensure that the Security Council’s   ceasefire demands are kept. They mark the ceasefire line,   establish observation posts and report to the Secretary-General   if there are violations of the ceasefire. This is an important role in critical   situations. Reports from the observation corps will be   non-partisan and accurate, in contrast to reports from the   involved parties themselves. This gives them an obvious value   both to the involved parties and to the outside world   generally. It is often emphasised that the United   Nations’ peacekeeping operations are only carried out at the   invitation of the countries involved. The troops and observation   corps are guests in the area, and they have a special   responsibility to behave in a way which is in agreement with   international law and ordinary politeness. Experience to now   indicates that the peacekeeping forces have been a correct   solution to the problem. To the present there have been – or are –   13 peacekeeping operations. fifty-three countries have   contributed with personnel, and the maximum force has been a   total of 50,000 men. If one counts all the soldiers who have been   involved in these operations, the total is something like 500,000   men. The Norwegian Nobel Committee sees this   mobilisation of troops from countries all over the world as a   tangible expression of the world community’s will to solve   conflicts by peaceful means. The technological development of   weapons systems has resulted in the peaceful resolution of   conflicts becoming the only realistic possibility. Nuclear   weapons have made the concept of wielding total power an   absurdity. In conflict situations it is therefore vitally   necessary that there are openings where real negotiations can be   initiated. In the opinion of the Nobel Committee the United   Nations peacekeeping operations contribute precisely to this. The Committee believes also that the   peacekeeping operations and the way they are carried out   contribute to making the ideas which were the very reason for the   establishment of the United Nations a reality. This year’s Peace   Prize should therefore also be regarded as a recognition of the   whole organisation, the United Nations. The prize gives   expression to the hope we all place in the United Nations. Secretary-General Pérez de   Cuéllar, who is directly responsible for the peacekeeping   operations, and who is therefore present today to receive the   prize, is here not only as the formal recipient, receiving the   prize on behalf of others. He is himself one of the prizewinners   today! With his never-tiring work and the results he has achieved   as an active mediator he should be accorded his part of the   honour for the growing confidence which is shown in the United   Nations. Confidence in the United Nations has   otherwise been a variable factor. The United Nations has for many   been seen as a body without power or effectiveness, a forum for   bilateral insults, a theatre stage at the side of the reality of   world politics. One has been able to have negative opinions of   the United Nations without thereby colliding with the accepted   state of affairs. But there is one overpowering argument in   favour of the United Nations: the organisation has survived, and   now defends more and more both its right to exist and its   capacity to survive. It has been pointed out, quite correctly,   that the United Nations can only be what the member states make   it. They can paralyse the United Nations by ignoring its   resolutions, by vetoing, by sabotaging its economy. But they can   also make the United Nations an active instrument in the fight   for peace, a focus for international law and human rights, and a   forum for the development of inter-racial understanding. The signs today indicate that it is the   latter alternative which is in the course of realising itself.   Perhaps the very idea of the United Nations is now coming into   its own? After what we have been through: Cold War, unsuccessful   negotiations, growing fear of a universal atomic death, it is   perhaps not so surprising that one again looks to the decisions   that were made when the United Nations treaty was signed. On the   ruins of the Second World War the survivors decided that   conflicts should thereafter be solved by peaceful means.   Barbarism should be replaced by friendly relations between   nations. Freedom and human rights should be respected without   reference to race, sex, language or religion. And the United   Nations were to be the means by which the aims of the United   Nations Treaty were to be realised. This year’s Peace Prize is a recognition of   and homage to one organ of the United Nations. But it ought to be   understood as a serious comment on the fact that we must, united   and with our whole hearts, invest in the United Nations. It   becomes clearer and clearer that what has to be done to secure   the future for new generations has to be done together. Our   determination has to be channelled into the United Nations. This   is the best hope for the future of the world – indeed its only   hope! The belief and the hope which are placed in   the United Nations have to be the hope and belief of the younger   generations. In the ideals of the United Nations they can search   for their own ideals, and it is they who are to form the world of   the future. In the selection of this year’s Peace Prize   laureate the Nobel Committee attached therefore great importance   to the role of young people in the United Nations Peacekeeping   Forces. It is precisely the contribution of the young which makes   the realisation of the United Nations’ aims possible in a   positive way. For obvious reasons it is precisely the   young who today feel the crippling powerlessness in their meeting   with the powers who steer the development of our world. It is   easy to lose one’s foothold, it is difficult to retain one’s   optimism – at times it is unclear whether there is any point in   attempting to do anything at all. To all the young people who feel their   situation in this way, I would direct a question, the question   which the young Norwegian poet Nordahl Grieg took up in his poem   To Youth: Well may you ask, in despondent alarm:     What is my weapon? What is my arm? And thus it is that the young prizewinners   can today raise their United Nations flag and answer with the   words of this poem by one of our own young fallen: This is the sword you must bear in your     fight –     Faith in this life and man’s God-given right.     For the future of all, seek it and choose it;     Die, if you must, gird it on and use it.     Silent the path of the arrow by night;     Halt with the spirit its death-dealing flight.     Then, only then, will all warfare cease.     Man’s dignity only can give us true peace."
"62","1989","The 14th Dalai Lama"," The Nobel Peace Prize is one of six awards   bearing the name Alfred Nobel that are presented today. Five of   these awards are made in Stockholm, and the Norwegian Nobel   Committee would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the   laureates who will be honoured in the Swedish capital today. This   year’s ceremony is an occasion of special gratification to us   Norwegians, as one of the recipients is a Norwegian, Professor   Trygve   Haavelmo, the winner of this year’s Nobel Prize for   Economics. We would like to congratulate him on this honour. This year’s Nobel Peace Prize has been   awarded to H.H. The Dalai Lama, first and foremost for his   consistent resistance to the use of violence in his people’s   struggle to regain their liberty. Ever since 1959 the Dalai Lama, together   with some one hundred thousand of his countrymen, has lived in an   organised community in exile in India. This is by no means the   first community of exiles in the world, but it is assuredly the   first and only one that has not set up any militant liberation   movement. This policy of nonviolence is all the more remarkable   when it is considered in relation to the sufferings inflicted on   the Tibetan people during the occupation of their country. The   Dalai Lama’s response has been to propose a peaceful solution   which would go a long way to satisfying Chinese interests. It   would be difficult to cite any historical example of a minority’s   struggle to secure its rights, in which a more conciliatory   attitude to the adversary has been adopted than in the case of   the Dalai Lama. It would be natural to compare him with Mahatma   Gandhi, one of this century’s greatest protagonists of peace, and   the Dalai Lama likes to consider himself one of Gandhi’s   successors. People have occasionally wondered why Gandhi himself   was never awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the present Nobel   Committee can with impunity share this surprise, while regarding   this year’s award of the prize as in part a tribute to the memory   of Mahatma Gandhi. This year’s laureate will also be able to   celebrate a significant jubilee, as it is now fifty years since   he was solemnly installed as H.H. the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of   the Tibetan people, when he was four years old. Pursuing the   process of selection that resulted in the choice of him in   particular would involve trespassing what, to a Westerner, is   terra incognita, where belief, thought and action exist in   a dimension of existence of which we are ignorant or maybe have   merely forgotten. According to Buddhist tradition every new   Dalai Lama is a reincarnation of his predecessor, and when the   thirteenth died in 1933 a search was immediately instigated to   find his reincarnation; oracles and learned lamas were consulted   and certain signs observed. Strange cloud formations drifted   across the heavens; the deceased, placed in the so-called Buddha   position facing south, was found two days later facing east. This   indicated that a search should be carried out to the east, and a   delegation accordingly set forth, first to one of Tibet’s sacred   lakes, where the future could be revealed in the surface of the   water. In this case, a monastery was indicated, as well as a   house with turquoise-coloured tiles. The delegation continued on   its way, and found first the monastery and then the house, in the   village of Takster in Eastern Tibet. It was the home of a crofter   and his family, and they were asked if they had any children.   They had a two-year-old son called Tenzin Gyatso. A number of   inexplicable acts carried out by this boy convinced the   delegation that they were at their journey’s end, and that the   Fourteenth Dalai Lama had been found. Like so much else in the realm of religion   this is not something we are asked to comprehend without reason:   we encounter phenomena that belong to a reality different from   our own, and to which we should respond not with an attempt at   rational explanation, but with reverent wonder. Throughout its history Tibet has been a   closed country, with little contact with the outside world. This   is also true of modern times, and maybe explains why its leaders   failed to attach due importance to formal de jure   recognition of their country as an autonomous state. This, too,   may be one of the reasons why the outside world did not feel any   obligation to support Tibet, when the country in 1950 and the   years that followed was gradually occupied by the Chinese, who –   in direct opposition to the Tibetans’ own interpretation –   claimed that Tibet has always been a part of China. In occupying   the country the Chinese have, according to the conclusion reached   by the International Commission of Jurists, been guilty of “the   most pernicious crime that any individual or nation can be   accused of, viz., a wilful attempt to annihilate an entire   people”. Meanwhile Tenzin Gyatso had by now reached   the age of sixteen, and in the critical situation that now arose,   he was charged with the task of playing the role of political   leader to his people. Up till then the country had been ruled on   his behalf by regents. He would have to assume the authority that   the title of Dalai Lama involved, a boy of sixteen, without   political experience, and with no education beyond his study of   Buddhist lore, which he had absorbed throughout his upbringing.   In his autobiography My Life and My People he has given us   a vivid account of his rigorous apprenticeship at the hands of   Tibetan lamas, and he declares that what he learnt was to prove   no mean preparation for his allotted career, not least the   political part of his work. It was on this basis he now developed   the policy of nonviolence with which he decided to confront the   Chinese invaders. As a Buddhist monk it was his duty never to   harm any living creature, but instead to show compassion to all   life. It is maybe not to be wondered at that people so closely   involved in what they call the world of reality should consider   his philosophy somewhat remote from ordinary considerations of   military strategy. The policy of nonviolence was also, of   course, based on pragmatic considerations: a small nation of some   six million souls, with no armed forces to speak of, faced one of   the world’s military superpowers. In a situation of this kind the   nonviolence approach was, in the opinion of the Dalai Lama, the   only practical one. In accordance with this he made several   attempts during the 1950s to negotiate with the Chinese. His aim   was to arrive at a solution of the conflict that would be   acceptable to both parties to the dispute, based on mutual   respect and tolerance. To achieve this he staked all his   authority as Dalai Lama to prevent any use of violence on the   part of the Tibetans; and his authority proved decisive, for as   the Dalai Lama he is, according to the Buddhist faith, more than   a leader in the traditional sense: he symbolises the whole   nation. His very person is imbued with some of the attributes of   a deity, which doubtless explains why his people, despite gross   indignities and acute provocation, have to such a marked degree   obeyed his wishes and abstained from the use of violence. From his exile in India he now waged his   unarmed struggle for his people with untiring patience. He has   every justification for calling his autobiography My Life and   My People, because the life of the Tibetans is in truth his   life. But political support from the outside world remained   conspicuous by its absence, apart from a few rather toothless UN   resolutions that were adopted in 1961 and 1965. Throughout the   60s and 70s the Dalai Lama was regarded as a pathetic figure from   a distant past: his beautiful and well-meaning philosophy of   peace was unfortunately out of place in this world. But in the course of the 1980s things have   taken a dramatic turn. There are several reasons for this. What   has happened – and is still happening – in Tibet has become more   generally known, and the community of nations has started to feel   a sense of joint responsibility for the future of the Tibetan   people. That their trials and tribulations have failed to break   the spirit of the Tibetans is another reason; on the contrary,   their feeling of national pride and identity and their   determination to survive have been enhanced, and these are   expressed in massive demonstrations. Here, as in other parts of   the world, it is becoming increasingly obvious that problems   cannot be solved by the use of brutal military power to crush   peaceful demonstrations. In Tibet, as elsewhere, conflicts must   be resolved politically through the medium of genuine   negotiation. The Dalai Lama’s negotiating policy has   received the support of a number of national assemblies and   international bodies, such as the United States Senate, the West   German Bundestag, the Parliament of Europe, the United States   Congress, eighty-six members of the Australian Parliament and the   Swiss National Assembly. Nor should we forget that the Dalai Lama   has been the recipient of a number of international awards and   honours in recognition of his work and in support of his cause.   It now seems in fact as if things are beginning to move in the   right direction, and what has been achieved in this respect may   be entirely ascribed to the Dalai Lama’s consistent policy of   nonviolence. For perfectly understandable reasons the   policy of nonviolence is often regarded as something negative, as   a failure to formulate a well-considered strategy, as a lack of   initiative and a tendency to evade the issue and adopt a passive   attitude. But this is not so: the policy of nonviolence is to a   very high degree a well thought-out combat strategy, It demands   singleminded and purposeful action, but one that eschews the use   of force. Those who adopt this strategy are by no means shirking   the issue: they manifest a moral courage which, when all is said   and done, exceeds that of men who resort to arms. It is courage   of this kind, together with an incredible measure of   self-discipline, that has characterised the attitude of the Dalai   Lama. His policy of nonviolence too, has been carefully   considered and determined. As he himself put it in April of last   year, after a peaceful demonstration in Lhasa has been fired on   by troops: “As I have explained on many occasions, nonviolence is   for us the only way. Quite patently, in our case violence would   be tantamount to suicide. For this reason, whether we like it or   not, nonviolence is the only approach, and the right one. We only   need more patience and determination”. In 1987 the Dalai Lama submitted a peace   plan for Tibet, the gist of which was that Tibet should be given   the status of a “peace zone” on a par with what had been proposed   for Nepal, a proposal which the Chinese in fact have supported.   The plan also envisaged a halt to Chinese immigration to Tibet.   This has proceeded on such a scale that there is a risk of the   Tibetans becoming a minority in their own country. Not least   interesting is the fact that the plan also contains measures for   the conservation of Tibet’s unique natural environment. Wholesale   logging operations in the forests on the slopes of the Himalayas   have resulted in catastrophic soil erosion, and are one of the   causes of the flood disasters suffered by India and Bangladesh.   The peace plan failed to initiate any negotiations with the   Chinese, even though the discrepancies between the two sides were   not particularly profound. The Dalai Lama’s willingness to compromise   was expressed still more clearly in his address to the European   Parliament on June 15th last year, where he stated his readiness   to abandon claims for full Tibetan independence. He acknowledged   that China, as an Asian superpower, had strategic interests in   Tibet, and was prepared to accept a Chinese military presence, at   any rate until such time as a regional peace plan could be   adopted. He also expressed his willingness to leave foreign   policy and defence in the hands of the Chinese. In return the   Tibetans should be granted the right to full internal autonomy.   In his efforts to promote peace the Dalai Lama has shown that   what he aims to achieve is not a power base at the expense of   others. He claims no more for his people than what everybody – no   doubt the Chinese themselves – recognises as elementary human   rights. In a world in which suspicion and aggression have all too   long characterised relations between peoples and nations, and   where the only realistic policy has been reliance on the use of   power, a new confession of faith is emerging, namely that the   least realistic of all solutions to conflict is the consistent   use of force. Modern weapons have in fact excluded such   solutions. The world has shrunk. Increasingly peoples   and nations have grown dependent on one another. No one can any   longer act entirely in his own interest. It is therefore   imperative that we should accept mutual responsibility for all   political, economic, and ecological problems. In view of this, fewer and fewer people   would venture to dismiss the Dalai Lama’s philosophy as utopian:   on the contrary, one would be increasingly justified in asserting   that his gospel of nonviolence is the truly realistic one, with   most promise for the future. And this applies not only to Tibet   but to each and every conflict. The future hopes of oppressed   millions are today linked to the unarmed battalions, for they   will win the peace: the justice of their demands, moreover, is   now so clear and the normal strength of their struggle so   indomitable that they can only temporarily be halted by force of   arms. In awarding the Peace Prize to H.H. the   Dalai Lama we affirm our unstinting support for his work for   peace, and for the unarmed masses on the march in many lands for   liberty, peace and human dignity."
"63","1990","Mikhail Gorbachev"," Your Royal Highnesses, Your Excellencies,   Ladies and Gentlemen,    This year’s Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the President   of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has made this   award in recognition of the leading role he has played in the   radical changes that have taken place in East-West relations.   President Gorbachev has undoubtedly cooperated with other persons   and other nations. But we recognise quite clearly that his   manifold personal contributions and his efforts on behalf of the   Soviet Union have proved decisive. For this reason the Nobel   Committee has in 1990 decided to honour him. We are experiencing dramatic changes in a   world that is still rent with conflict. Nevertheless, we also   have clear evidence that a peace process has started. East and   West, the two mighty power blocs, have managed to abandon their   life-threatening confrontation and have, instead, embarked on the   long and patient road to cooperation on the basis of negotiation.   The task now is to create a peaceful framework for the   far-reaching transformation which will inevitably continue to   take place in our part of the world. We have already seen the fruits of this new   climate between East and West. Ancient European nations, such as Poland,   Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and now East Germany too, have regained   their freedom and have, for better or for worse, assumed   responsibility for their own national destiny. Even though this   process of detente still has its problems and is yet not   terminated in all parts of our continent of Europe, it is   nevertheless possible today, maybe for the first time in many   hundreds of years, to envisage a Europe of the people and, we   hope, also a Europe at peace. This is due not least to the fact that the   armaments race is ebbing out in our part of the globe. In mistrust and fear this race has been   going on for close on half a century. The result has been a   terrifying waste of intellectual and material resources on both   sides of the Iron Curtain. Here too, we now at last see a change. Comprehensive negotiations, bilateral as   well as multilateral, accompanied by concrete and realistic   compromise, have led to a process involving substantial   reductions in standing armies and death-dealing armaments. Within   the last few months disarmament agreements have been reached   which are without parallel in our part of the world, in this or   indeed in previous centuries. In making this year’s award of the Peace   Prize, the Nobel Committee wishes to emphasise the tremendous   potential which is now available for a more secure world, and for   a more responsible and rational use of our resources. The way in which confrontation has been   replaced by cooperation has also had its consequences in other   parts of the world. Several regional conflicts have been   resolved, or at least come closer to a solution. The   uncompromising attitude of the Cold War has given way to a   pattern of negotiation, in which the interests and responsibility   of the regional communities themselves have replaced old   ideological considerations, or the all-too-often ruthless laws of   the balance of power. These changes have given the United Nations   a new lease of life: for the first time since its creation after   the Second World War this organisation has been able to play the   role for which it was originally intended. It can now start to   exercise its supremely important responsibility for the creation   of an international community based on the rule of law and the   establishment of peace between nations. The award this year of the Peace Prize to   the President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, is an   historic event not least because some of the previous awards made   by our Committee – for example to the great champion of human   rights Andrei   Sakharov in 1975, and to the trade union leader Lech Walesa in 1983 – were   received with cool hostility in the Soviet Union and in Poland at   the time, involving the rejection, in these countries, of all   that the Norwegian Nobel Committee stood for. On these grounds   too the award constitutes a landmark. The Norwegian Nobel   Committee considers that there is thus a historical link between   today’s event and December 10th, 1975, and 1983, which augurs   well for the future. The Norwegian Nobel Committee is an   independent organisation answerable neither to the Government nor   to the National Assembly (the Storting) of our country. The five   members of the Committee are only answerable to their own   consciences, and their decisions are based on the personal   political judgment and sound common sense of each one. The   guidelines governing our work are nevertheless clearly set out:   these are to be found in Alfred Nobel’s testament, written nearly   a hundred years ago. The award this year is very much in line   with Alfred Nobel’s own wishes and desires. Nobel wanted the   prize to be awarded to someone who had worked to promote   “fraternity between nations”. That was the expression generally   used in his day to denote the substitution of international   cooperation for conflict. Nobel also wished his prize to be given   to someone who had actively promoted a reduction in “standing   armies” and worked for the “holding of peace congresses”, what we   today would call disarmament and negotiation. Seldom has our Committee felt more in tune   with Alfred Nobel’s wishes than this year. It is with a special sense of satisfaction   that we award the Peace Prize to President Gorbachev. Each one of   us, maybe in our different ways, has experienced the tension and   threat of war that have cast a dark shadow over all the post-war   years. The new-found openness and willingness to cooperate shown   by the Soviet Union, and its readiness to accept realistic   compromise, have created fresh hope under his leadership. We fully realise that the Soviet Union is   undergoing a dramatic period of transformation within its own   borders: dictatorship is to be replaced by greater democracy,   centralisation by the right of each republic for   self-determination, a command economy by a freer market. This   transformation is inevitably a painful process, involving great   sacrifice. But we should like the many peoples of the Soviet   Union to know that the respect and expectation of the outside   world for their great country have never been as profound as   today. There has been nothing comparable since the “Great   Patriotic War”, which this country and our Western Allies fought   together against the barbarism of National Socialism. At that   time the road that led from world war to Cold War proved   disappointingly short. It is our hope that we are now celebrating   the end of the Cold War. Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev was born in   1931 in a small village just outside Stavropol, north of the   Caucasus Mountains, in a region that forms part of the Russian   Republic, adjoining the ancient non-Russian countries of Georgia,   Armenia and Azerbaijan, with their profound Christian and Muslim   roots. Our laureate is in fact a native of the southern Soviet   Union. He comes of peasant stock, and was born 14 years after the   great revolution which shook not only the Russian Empire but the   entire world. He was born during the dramatic collectivisation of   Soviet agriculture, and grew up on a collective farm, where his   father worked at a tractor station. He was an eight-year-old schoolboy when the   last world war broke out, and only 10 years old when Germany   attacked the Soviet Union. His schooling was both sporadic and   limited by wartime conditions: he was forced to work as a   replacement for soldiers fighting at the front. When peace came   he was 14 years old, and was able to continue his education, but,   in common with most young people of his age, worked during his   summer holidays. He was soon involved in the Communist Party’s   youth organisation, and was rapidly promoted. As a matter of   course he joined the Communist party at the age of 21. Two years before, he had left his native   village in the Northern Caucasus, and made his way to the capital   to embark on the study of law at the University of Moscow. Here   he not only met Raisa Titorenko, who subsequently became his   wife, but was also active in the Communist Party student   movement, with responsibility for ideology and propaganda among   fellow students in his faculty. He took a degree in law and then   returned to Stavropol, where he was employed full-time in the   Communist youth movement. By the age of 25 he was in fact a   member of the establishment, with agricultural questions as his   chief concern. In 1967, he took a second degree, this time in   agriculture, and was rapidly promoted in the local party   hierarchy. By the 1970s this year’s laureate was   active politically on the national scene: his breakthrough came   in 1978, when at the age of 47, he was given joint responsibility   for the entire agricultural set-up of the Soviet Union in the   Communist Party’s Secretariat in Moscow, which meant permanent   residence in the capital. Seven years later he was elected leader   of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party, the most influential post   in the country. This was in 1985, by which time he was 54 years   old. He is now a figure of international prominence. While still   retaining the position of Party Secretary, he is also elected   President of the Soviet Union by a reformed parliament. Although Mikhail Gorbachev is a man of   quite outstanding talent and ability, he insisted recently that   the story of his own family is actually history itself or in   other words the history of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev is in fact   a child of the revolution and the world war, of Lenin’s,   Stalin’s, Khrushchev’s and Breshnev’s Soviet Union. And like most   people in this world he is a product of the society in which he   grew up. Today, this Soviet society is a historical   experiment which is being shaken to its foundations, and this is   so not least because Mikhail Gorbachev was also capable of   breaking the mould of the society from which he sprang. Or as he   personally expressed it in the televised interview, in which he   spoke of the perestroika which he symbolises: “We came to the   conclusion that we could no longer continue to live the way we   were. We needed major changes in every department of life”. Our laureate has in fact been a Communist   all his life; and he still is to this day, even though this might   shock us, as he declared in an interview he recently gave in the   USA. We are not really so shocked. But this is neither the time   nor the place to discuss the Soviet Union’s internal affairs. The   Norwegian Nobel Committee has given President Gorbachev the Peace   Prize for his leading role in international politics. Our Committee has nonetheless observed one   aspect of life in the Soviet Union – the much greater openness   President Gorbachev has introduced. This has to a very large   extent helped to promote international confidence. Greater   openness has in many ways ensured a basis for the comprehensive   agreements on disarmament and cooperation between East and West   that we are witnessing today. An entire world is today watching the   Soviet Union’s dramatic and heroic struggle to overcome the   awesome economic, social and political problems which shake the   country. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, not least, is also   watching. It is our wish that the award of the Peace   Prize to its President, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev, will be   recognised as a helping hand in an hour of need, as a greeting to   all the peoples of the Soviet Union, as a sign that the outside   world is watching their struggle with a sense of fellow feeling,   and with a sense of participating in the historical events that   are taking place. It has been suggested that the award of   this year’s prize to the President of the Soviet Union by the   Nobel Committee was somewhat bold. Our boldness is, however,   nothing like the boldness shown by Mikhail Gorbachev when he   embarked on the course which has today led to the receipt of the   Nobel Peace Prize, or the boldness shown by the many peoples of   the Soviet Union too in rewriting history.

"64","1991","Aung San Suu Kyi"," Your Majesties, Your Excellencies, Ladies   and Gentlemen,    We are assembled here today to honour Aung San Suu Kyi for her   outstanding work for democracy and human rights, and to present   to her the Nobel Peace Prize for 1991. The occasion gives rise to   many and partly conflicting emotions. The Peace Prize Laureate is   unable to be here herself. The great work we are acknowledging   has yet to be concluded. She is still fighting the good fight.   Her courage and commitment find her a prisoner of conscience in   her own country, Burma. Her absence fills us with fear and   anxiety, which can nevertheless only be a faint shadow of the   fear and anxiety felt by her family. We welcome this opportunity   of expressing our deepest sympathy with them, with her husband,   Michael Aris, and with her sons, Alexander and Kim. We feel with   you, and we are very grateful to you for coming to Oslo to   receive the Nobel Prize on behalf of your wife and mother. Our fear and anxiety are mixed with a sense   of confidence and hope. In the good fight for peace and   reconciliation, we are dependent on persons who set examples,   persons who can symbolise what we are seeking and mobilise the   best in us. Aung San Suu Kyi is just such a person. She unites   deep commitment and tenacity with a vision in which the end and   the means form a single unit. Its most important elements are:   democracy, respect for human rights, reconciliation between   groups, non-violence, and personal and collective discipline. She has herself clearly indicated the   sources of her inspiration: principally Mahatma Gandhi and her   father, Aung San, the leader in Burma’s struggle for liberation.   The philosopher of non-violence and the General differ in many   respects, but also show fundamental similarities. In both, one   can see genuine independence, true modesty, and “a profound   simplicity”, to use Aung San Suu Kyi’s own words about her   father. To Aung San, leadership was a duty, and could only be   carried out on the basis of humility in face of the task before   him and the confidence and respect of the people to be led. While no doubt deriving a great deal of   inspiration from Gandhi and her father, Aung San Suu Kyi has also   added her own independent reflections to what has become her   political platform. The keynote is the same profound simplicity   as she sees in her father. The central position given to human   rights in her thinking appears to reflect a real sense of the   need to protect human dignity. Man is not only entitled to live   in a free society; he also has a right to respect. On this   platform, she has built a policy marked by an extraordinary   combination of sober realism and visionary idealism. And in her   case this is more than just a theory: she has gone a long way   towards showing how such a doctrine can be translated into   practical politics. For a doctrine of peace and reconciliation   to be translated into practice, one absolute condition is   fearlessness. Aung San Suu Kyi knows this. One of her essays   opens with the statement that it is not power that corrupts, but   fear.1 The comment was aimed at   the totalitarian regime in her own country. They have allowed   themselves to be corrupted because they fear the people they are   supposed to lead. This has led them into a vicious circle. In her   thinking, however, the demand for fearlessness is first and   foremost a general demand, a demand on all of us. She has herself   shown fearlessness in practice. She opposed herself alone to the   rifle barrels. Can anything withstand such courage? What was in   that Major’s mind when at the last moment he gave the order not   to fire? Perhaps he was impressed by her bravery, perhaps he   realised that nothing can be achieved by brute force.2 Violence is its own worst enemy, and   fearlessness is the sharpest weapon against it. It is not least   Aung San Suu Kyi’s impressive courage which makes her such a   potent symbol, like Gandhi and her father Aung San. Aung San was   shot in the midst of his struggle. But if those who arranged the   assassination thought it would remove him from Burmese politics,   they were wrong. He became the unifying symbol of a free Burma   and an inspiration to those who are now fighting for a free   society. In addition to his example and inspiration, his position   among his people, over forty years after his death, gave Aung San   Suu Kyi the political point of departure she needed. She has   indeed taken up her inheritance, and is now in her own right the   symbol of the revolt against violence and the struggle for a free   society, not only in Burma, but also in the rest of Asia and in   many other parts of the world. We ordinary people, I believe, feel that   with her courage and her high ideals, Aung San Suu Kyi brings out   something of the best in us. We feel we need precisely her sort   of person in order to retain our faith in the future. That is   what gives her such power as a symbol, and that is why any   illtreatment of her feels like a violation of what we have most   at heart. The little woman under house arrest stands for a   positive hope. Knowing she is there gives us confidence and faith   in the power of good. Aung San Suu Kyi was born in 1945. Her   father was killed when she was two. She has no personal memories   of him. Her mother was a diplomat, and Aung San Suu Kyi was to   spend many of her early years and much of her later life abroad.   In 1967, she took a degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics   at St. Hugh’s College, Oxford. From 1969 on, she worked for two   years for the United Nations in New York. In 1972 she married   Michael Aris, a British specialist on Tibet. For a time the   family lived in Bhutan, but in the mid-seventies they moved back   to Oxford. In addition to being a housewife with two small   children, Aung San Suu Kyi kept up her academic work, gradually   concentrating on modern Burmese history and literature. She was a   visiting scholar at Kyoto University in Japan and at the Indian   Institute of Advanced Studies in New Delhi. On her return to   Burma in 1988, she broke off her studies at the London School of   Oriental and African Studies. There is little in these outward   events to suggest the role she was to embark on in 1988. But she   was well prepared. There is a great deal of evidence that the   fate of her own people had constantly weighed on her mind. Her   husband has told us how she often reminded him that one day she   would have to return to Burma, and that she would count on his   support.3 Her studies, too, as we   have seen, became increasingly concentrated on Burma’s modern   history. The study of her father and the part he played in   Burmese history no doubt increased her political commitment and   sense that his mantle had fallen on her.4 In moving to Japan, she was virtually   following in her father’s footsteps. During the Second World War,   it was from a base in Japan that Aung San built up Burma’s   independent national army. When Japan invaded Burma, Aung San and   his men went too. Before long, they switched from fighting the   British colonial power to resisting the occupying Japanese and   supporting the retaking of Burma by the Allies. After the war, he   led the negotiations with the British which were to lead to final   independence. Aung San Suu Kyi appears to have felt an urgent   need to study the process which led to Burma’s independent   statehood, and to understand the ideals governing the politics.   In a beautiful essay comparing the Indian and Burmese experience   of colonisation, she also brings out the special features of   Burma’s cultural heritage.5   History is important. You choose who you are by choosing which   tradition you belong to. Aung San Suu Kyi seeks to call attention   to what she sees as the best aspects of the national and cultural   heritage and to identify herself with them. Such profound   knowledge and such a deep sense of identity are an irresistible   force in the political struggle. The occasion of Aung San Suu Kyi’s return   to Burma in 1988 was, characteristically enough, not the   political situation but her old mother’s illness. The political   turbulence had just begun, however. There had been demonstrations   and confrontations with the police with some two hundred killed.   The unrest continued while she was nursing her dying mother. That   was the situation in which she resolved to take an active part in   what she herself called “the second struggle for national   independence”. The military regime had seized power in   Burma in 1962. The disturbances which broke out in 1988 were a   reaction to growing repression. In the summer of that year, at a   time when the situation was very uncertain, Aung San Suu Kyi   intervened with a open letter to the government, proposing the   appointment of a consultative committee of respected independent   persons to lead the country into multi-party elections. In the   letter, she emphasised the need for discipline and for refraining   from the use of force on either side, and demanded the release of   political prisoners.6 A couple of days later, she addressed   several hundred thousand people in front of the large Shwedagon   Pagoda in Rangoon, presenting a political program based on human   rights, democracy and non-violence. On the 18th of September,   after hesitating for a few weeks, the armed forces reacted by   tightening the restrictions. The so-called “State Law and Order   Restoration Council” (SLORC) was established, and martial law was   introduced under which meetings were banned and persons could be   sentenced without trial. Political parties were not prohibited   (perhaps with meetings banned it was thought unnecessary). A week   after the establishment of SLORC, Aung San Suu Kyi and a few   other members of the opposition founded the National League for   Democracy, the NLD. She went on to engage in vigorous political   activity, defying the ban on meetings and military provocations,   and holding heavily attended political meetings all over the   country. One remarkable feature of her political campaign was the   appeal she had for the country’s various ethnic groups,   traditionally at odds with each other. It must have been her personal prestige   which caused the regime to hesitate so long, but in July 1989 she   was placed under house arrest. In May 1990, elections were held,   in which the NLD won an overwhelming victory and over 80 per cent   of the seats in the national assembly. There is general agreement   that this was principally a triumph for Aung San Suu Kyi. Why did the SLORC allow free elections?   Probably because they expected a very different result, a result   which would somehow have provided the legitimacy they needed to   retain power. The dilemma of such regimes was demonstrated –   trapped in their own lies. At any rate, they refused to accept   the election result. The election was in effect annulled. The   SLORC continued, but with reduced legitimacy. Lack of legitimacy   is often made up for by increased brutality. Amnesty   International has reported continuing serious violations of human   rights.7 Today, the Burmese regime   appears to have developed into one of the most repressive in the   world. In recent decades, the Norwegian Nobel   Committee has awarded a number of Prizes for Peace in recognition   of work for human rights.8 It has   done so in the conviction that a fundamental prerequisite for   peace is the recognition of the right of all people to life and   to respect. Another motivation lies in the knowledge that in its   most basic form, the concept of human rights is not just a   Western idea, but common to all major cultures. Permit me in this   connection to quote a paragraph of Aung San Suu Kyi’s essay In   Quest of Democracy: Where there is no justice there can be no secure     peace.     …That just laws which uphold human rights are the necessary     foundations of peace and security would be denied only by     closed minds which interpret peace as the silence of all     opposition and security as the assurance of their own power.     The Burmese associate peace and security with coolness and     shade: The shade of a tree is cool indeed     The shade of parents is cooler     The shade of teachers is cooler still     The shade of the ruler is yet more cool     But coolest of all is the shade of the Buddha’s teachings. Thus to provide the people with the protective coolness of     peace and security, rulers must observe the teachings of the     Buddha. Central to these teachings are the concepts of truth,     righteousness and loving kindness. It is government based on     these very qualities that the people of Burma are seeking in     their struggle for democracy.9 This is not the first time that political   persecution at home has prevented a Peace Prize Laureate from   receiving the prize in person. It happened to Carl von Ossietzky in   1936, ill in one of Hitler’s concentration camps.10 It happened to Andrei Sakharov and to   Lech Walesa.   Ossietzky died before the regime fell, but Sakharov and Walesa   saw their struggles succeed.11 It   is our hope that Aung San Suu Kyi will see her struggle crowned   with success. However, we must also face up to the   likelihood that this will not be the last occasion on which a   Peace Prize Laureate is unable to attend. Let that remind us that   in a world such as ours, peace and reconciliation cannot be   achieved once and for all. We will never be able to lower our   standards. On the contrary, a better world demands even greater   vigilance of us, still greater fearlessness, and the ability to   develop in ourselves the “profound simplicity” of which this   year’s Laureate has spoken. This applies to all of us as   individuals, but must apply especially to those in positions of   power and authority. Show humility and show fearlessness – like   Aung San Suu Kyi. The result may be a better world to live   in."
"65","1992","Rigoberta Menchú Tum"," Your Majesties, Your Excellencies, Ladies   and Gentlemen,    The Norwegian Nobel Committee decided to award the Nobel Peace   Prize for 1992 to Rigoberta Menchú Tum. It is a particular   pleasure for us to welcome you, Rigoberta Menchú Tum, here   in Oslo to receive the award. Welcome to this little winter   country in the far north, so far from your own country and your   own world. The distance, both geographically and culturally, is   vast, but the occasion of this award, in particular, should   prompt us to think about nearness. Wherever in the world they   take place, conflicts and wars have in our time become the whole   world’s concern. Even at this distance, we feel threatened by a   local conflict in Guatemala, not militarily, but because it   affects the world’s future. The situation in Guatemala acquires a   special significance because it is such a clear case of general   problem that we must all contribute to solving. I refer to such   matters as ethnic and racial segregation, the rights of   aboriginal peoples, the environment and the sharing of resources,   the gap between the poor and rich. I refer to the role of women   in society. The path Guatemala takes in all these respects is   important to us. So we commit ourselves. Nearness has another aspect to it, however,   which a person like Rigoberta Menchú Tum obliges us to think   about. It appears in the general humanity of our deepest needs,   our dreams of peace and reconciliation, our longing for the good   life, our right to live and to be respected. We have needs and we   have rights simply by virtue of our humanity, across ethnic,   cultural and geographical divides. A moment like the present also   serves to remind us of this nearness, inherent in our common   humanity. By maintaining a disarming humanity in a brutal world,   Rigoberta Menchú Tum appeals to the best in all of us,   wherever we live and whatever our background. She stands as a   uniquely potent symbol of a just struggle. Rigoberta Menchú Tum is a Quiché   Indian. She was born in a poor Indian village in the Guatemala   mountains, and grew up in the Indian culture, only learning   Spanish as an adult. As she describes her childhood in her   autobiography, it was marked by great closeness in the family and   in the village, but also by extreme poverty. In order not to   starve, she was forced as a child to join in the cotton-picking   on the big plantations, where the Indians were treated little   better than animals. “I started thinking about my childhood,” she   writes in the autobiography, “and I came to the conclusion that I   hadn’t had a childhood at all. I was never a child. I hadn’t been   to school, I hadn’t had enough food to grow properly, I had   nothing. I asked myself: ‘How is this possible?'”. This is her   account of how at an early age awareness began growing on her of   the road she must take in life. How will a world turn out that   steals childhood from children? That is a question we must ask   ourselves today. A few people nevertheless seem to be born with   reserves of inner strength and humanity that defy the worst   conditions. What such people have to tell us is worth listening   to. Rigoberta Menchú Tum was to experience   the confiscation of Indian land. Her village was one of several   hundred that were levelled to the ground. Massacres were normal.   Guatemala acquired a civilian government in 1982, but even so   innumerable massacres have been registered since then in rural   districts. Several hundred mass graves are known. Since the   beginning of this year alone, American and Canadian human rights   organisations have registered 380 summary executions and 80 cases   of torture. The guerrillas, themselves a response to the brutal   expulsion from the land, have in their turn been used as an   excuse for a blind brutalisation of the whole society. That   extreme brutalisation struck at Rigoberta Menchú Tum’s own   family. Her father, who was the elected leader of his village,   was active in starting the CUC, the Committee of the Peasant   Union, which soon won widespread support. He was burnt to death.   Her mother and brother were bestially tortured and killed by the   military. It is five hundred years this year since   Columbus “discovered” America, as we have been brought up to say,   or since colonisation began. The celebration of the anniversary   has at least produced one benefit, in the spotlight it has so   effectively focussed on the worldwide problem of the rights of   aboriginal peoples. Developments in America demonstrate the   problem more clearly than anywhere else. This was a whole   continent, the population of which in Columbus’s day may have   numbered as many as 100 million. Today only a fraction of these   Indian peoples survive, and any truly Indian culture can only be   found isolated in small pockets. Why was the Indian culture less   able than others to resist the European pressure? Any processes   elsewhere resembling the one in America have only taken place in   more marginal areas of the world. Such processes are complex, and   this is not the place for a more detailed analysis. What is   clear, however, is that at certain times and in certain places we   are confronted by a different force from infectious diseases and   mortality or the haphazard outcome of wars and rapacity, and that   is the systemic “ethnic cleansing” of the aboriginal population –   better known as genocide. There is a most urgent need to define   the rights of aboriginal peoples and to respect those rights in a   manner which makes it possible to live in peace and mutual   understanding. To succeed in this, we need people like Rigoberta   Menchú Tum. For the Norwegian Nobel Committee it was a happy   coincidence that it was precisely in the year of Columbus that   she emerged as such a strong candidate for the Nobel Peace   Prize. Rigoberta Menchú Tum chose to dedicate   herself to political and social work for her people. In charming   and characteristically forthright terms, she tells us in her   autobiography what a difficult choice it was not to have a   family. She was engaged, she tells us, and felt an obligation to   the ancestral principle of seeking happiness not only for oneself   but for one’s family. A threat of ethnic cleansing of course   lends extra weight to such an obligation. But she chose   otherwise. “I was very confused,” she writes, “Society and so   many other things wouldn’t leave me alone, I always had a heavy   heart.” She became an active member of the CUC. Then she   participated in the founding of the organisation called the   Revolutionary Christians. “We understood ‘revolutionary’ in the   real meaning of the word: ‘transformation’. If I had chosen the   armed struggle, I would be in the mountains now.” Owing to her   political activity, she has had to spend twelve years in exile in   Mexico. She became one of the first Indian delegates to the   United Nations,   and is a member of the UN group that works for human rights and   the cause of the Indian peoples. In her book A Strategy for Peace,   the Swedish-American moral philosopher Sissela Bok describes what   she calls the “pathology of partisanship”, or the brutalising   effect of the use of violence. Whoever commits acts of violence   will lose his humanity. Thus, violence breeds violence and hate   breeds hate. She quotes the English poet Stephen Spender, who   experienced this process in himself when he took part in the   Spanish Civil War: “It was clear to me that unless I cared about   every murdered child impartially, I did not care about children   being murdered at all.”1 But how   can one break out of the vicious circle of the pathology of   partisanship? It is easy enough to keep out and call for   non-violence or an end to hatred when one is not oneself   confronted with the blind violence of the other side. Nor is it   indeed our responsibility to judge or to condemn in such cases.   What we can do, however, is to point to the shining individual   examples of people who manage to preserve their humanity in   brutal and violent surroundings, of persons who for that very   reason compel our special respect and admiration. Such people   give us a hope that there are ways out of the vicious circle. I have had occasion to mention Rigoberta   Menchú Tum’s autobiography a number of times. It is an   extraordinary human document. It describes cruelty in sober and   matter-of-fact terms. Its driving force is moral indignation. In   some connections, she also mentions her hatred of those   responsible for the violence and repression. But at the same   time, the account reflects a disarming humanity. Almost gaily,   she notes funny little concrete details in an otherwise ruthless   existence; with love, she describes Indian customs. I know no   better example of her disarming attitude than her description   here in Oslo last year of her meeting with Colonel Roderigues:   “We greeted each other and exchanged a few words. The man who   killed my mother congratulated me on my nomination for the Nobel   Peace Prize and called it a national honour. I realised then that   at bottom we are all human beings. It was like meeting a distant   acquaintance. I had a feeling of calm as I spoke to him.” It is stupid to meet the world with too   much trust, but even more stupid to meet it with too little. The   goal of Rigoberta Menchú Tum’s work, as she has said on many   occasions; is reconciliation and peace. She knows, better than   most, that the foundations for future reconciliation are laid in   the manner in which one conducts one’s struggle. Even in the most   brutal situations, one must retain one’s faith that there is a   minimum of human feelings in all of us. Rigoberta Menchú Tum   preserved that faith. It is with the deepest respect and in   admiration of her efforts that the Norwegian Nobel Committee   today awards her the Nobel Peace Prize.    Thank you."
"66","1993","Nelson Mandela, F.W. de Klerk"," Your Majesties, Excellencies, Ladies and   Gentlemen,    The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel   Peace Prize for 1993 to Nelson R. Mandela and Frederik Willem de   Klerk for their work for the peaceful termination of the   apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new,   democratic South Africa. It is a great pleasure to be able to   welcome the two Prize-Winners here today. This is the third time the Nobel Committee   has awarded the prize to human rights advocates who have actively   participated in the struggle against the apartheid regime in   South Africa. There are many reasons why South Africa has   attracted so much attention. After the second World War and the   fall of the Hitler regime, racism as a system was thoroughly   discredited. The general trend was to remove institutionalised   racial barriers at the same time as the old colonial empires were   being dismantled. But just when this was the general trend, South   Africa chose to move in the opposite direction. From 1948 onwards   the apartheid regime was consolidated and systematically, through   legislation and organisational forms, developed into a brutal   regime of oppression based on criteria of race alone. Thus it   also became the symbol of a particularly debasing form of   oppression. The apartheid regime gave racism a face. When ANC   leader Albert   Lutuli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1960, more than   a generation ago, he drew attention to the systematic,   institutionalised undermining of human equality. As a Christian,   Lutuli anchored the idea of equality in his religious   beliefs: As a Christian and patriot, [I]     could not look while systematic attempts were made, almost in     every department of life, to debase the God-factor in man or to     set a limit beyond which the human being in his black form     might not strive to serve his Creator to the best of his     ability. To remain neutral in a situation where the laws of the     land virtually criticised God for having created men of colour     was the sort of thing I could not, as a Christian,     tolerate.1 By awarding the prize for 1960 to Lutuli,   the Norwegian Nobel Committee initiated what was in some regards   a new policy. From then on, the struggle for human rights became   a much more important criterion for awarding the Peace Prize than   it had been previously. This criterion has been controversial,   for it has been pointed out that work for human rights has   created conflicts in many areas. On the surface, and in the   short-term, this is true. But it also seems true that on the   whole the committee’s policy has gained widespread support   throughout the world and within different cultures. If anything close to a stable peace is to   be achieved, respect for each other’s character, integrity and   dignity is an absolute requirement. This is an important point in   Immanuel Kant’s famous 200-year-old essay on everlasting   peace.2 He links peace to the idea   of justice, which was the cornerstone of his political   philosophy. During the cold war, and with the type of   ideologicallybased oppression that existed in the totalitarian   regimes then, one could have been led to believe that peace was   dependent on the balance of terror, and that oppression created   stability. These must have been the thoughts motivating those who   criticised any consideration of the struggle for human rights as   work for peace. Today, we know that these regimes of oppression   were the most fragile. They did not yield freedom, nor did they   offer stability. The breaches of the most fundamental human   rights and the systematic undermining of human dignity and   self-respect were bound to give rise to opposition. Such regimes   always find themselves in a vicious circle sooner or later,   facing the danger of disintegration into wars, chaos and   bloodshed. South Africa had long been caught up in   such a vicious circle. However, on the eve of the 1990’s the   regime reversed its policies under its new president, Frederik   Willem de Klerk. Nelson Mandela was released unconditionally   after nearly 28 years of imprisonment, and the dismantling of   apartheid became the official policy of the regime. To what   degree this was a strategic adjustment to a situation   characterised by internal dissolution or the fruits of moral   reflection as well, each individual participant must determine   for himself. South Africa had long been caught up in a vicious   circle, and only time can show whether these initiatives came too   late. The natural partner in the negotiations   that were initiated was the ANC, whose leader Nelson Mandela went   straight from prison to the negotiating table. Mandela had early   taken a stand as an active opponent of apartheid. Initially, he   was among those who were inspired by Gandhi’s methods of   nonviolence. But the climate hardened inexorably, as the   Sharpeville massacre of 1960 showed.3 In 1962 Mandela was imprisoned, and his   confinement would last almost 28 years. Some months after his   release in 1990 we had the pleasure of receiving Mandela here in   Oslo to the so-called “Hate Conference” organised by the Nobel   Committee in cooperation with the Elie Wiesel   Foundation.4 It was a conference   which enjoyed the participation of an exceptional group of   outstanding men and women. And in this setting Nelson Mandela   stood out. He spoke with a moral authority and in a constructive   tone that made a profound impression. This is my personal   recollection, but I know that I was not alone in feeling   this. Many people have remarked on the apparent   lack of bitterness that characterises Mandela’s conduct since he   was released from prison. He himself has said that perhaps he   would have harboured bitter thoughts if he had not had a job to   do. Then he adds as an afterthought that if only all those who   have made such great sacrifices for the sake of justice could see   that they have not been in vain, that would serve to eliminate   the bitterness from their hearts. The two Prize-Winners, from their highly   disparate points of departure, the one from the side of the   oppressors and the other from the side of the oppressed, have   taken initiatives to break the vicious circle that their country   was caught up in. These are initiatives the world has taken note   of, initiatives which reflect personal integrity and great   political courage on the part of both men. They have both chosen   not to dwell on the deep wounds of the past. In so doing, they   are different from leaders in many other conflict areas, even   though the wounds in South Africa were deeper than perhaps   anywhere else. Mandela and de Klerk have chosen reconciliation   rather than the alternative, which would inevitably have been an   ever more bitter and bloodier conflict. Another aspect of the   policy of reconciliation is compromise and the recognition that   one must give in order to be able to take. Political action on   this basis reflects the highest political virtue. But in order to   attain success, all parties must be willing to sacrifice. Eminent statesmanship has been demonstrated   in South Africa, and it is astonishing what has been achieved   since Mandela was released in 1990. The institutionalised   apartheid regime has been dismantled, a provisional constitution   has been adopted, a broadly based Transitional Executive Council   has been established. The date for fully democratic elections has   been set.5 There can be no doubt   that the main credit for these highly significant steps towards a   peaceful transition to a democratic South Africa is due to these   two Prize-Winners. Yet we know that the process is not   finished. The danger of setbacks exists. There are groups who are   not party to or who have withdrawn from the negotiations. South   Africa today is still a society marked by bitterness, fear and   violence. The number of people killed while the negotiations have   taken place is in the tens of thousands. The vicious circle has   not been decisively broken. Thus, there are today two competing   trends – conflict and reconciliation. In the ongoing process it   is vital that all parties demonstrate their goodwill by doing   their utmost to bring the violence to an end. It is also   essential that the groups now outside the negotiations are drawn   into active participation in the continuing process of   reconciliation and compromise. There is an unquestionable need   for more statesmanship. Should we, then, have waited to award the   prize until the definitive breakthrough of the policy of   reconciliation? Some would say so. However, the question is   whether it makes sense to talk of a definitive breakthrough. Work   for peace and reconciliation requires ceaseless effort.   Slackening off means opening for new conflicts. Thus the   Norwegian Nobel Committee, when awarding the Nobel Peace Prize,   will always have to enter into processes in one way or another.   In his will, Nobel wrote that the prize should be given to the   person or persons who in the preceding year have contributed the   most for the benefit of peace. It is the conviction of the   committee that Nelson R. Mandela and Frederik Willem de Klerk   have made a brilliant contribution and attained astonishing   results with their policy of peace and reconciliation. They have   given peace a chance. Whether peace will prevail, time will have   to show. Alfred Nobel also intended the institution   of the Peace Prize itself to represent a positive contribution to   peace. Thus it is the hope of the Nobel committee that this   year’s award will serve as a contribution, however small, for the   peaceful development towards complete democracy in South   Africa. It is the privilege of the Norwegian Nobel   Committee to award the Nobel Peace Prize. We do so in admiration   and deep respect for those who manage to maintain their humanity   in a world characterised by fear and brutality, who assume the   responsibility to do something about the problems, and who   succeed in doing so. The policy of reconciliation that Nelson R.   Mandela and Frederik Willem de Klerk represent provides hope not   only for South Africa; it is also a shining example for the world   that there are ways out of the vicious circle of violence and   bitterness.

"67","1994","Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin"," Your Majesties, Your Excellencies, Ladies   and Gentlemen,    The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel   Peace Prize for 1994, in alphabetical order, to Yasser Arafat,   Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin, for their efforts to create peace   in the Middle East. It is a great pleasure for us to be able to   welcome all three laureates here today. We know that they are all   heavily engaged in complicated political processes. We therefore   set all the more store by your having taken the time to come so   far north to our wintry little country to receive the Peace   Prize. That the fate of the Middle East attracts   so much global attention is no coincidence. The conflict, or   conflicts, in the Middle East concern us all in a very special   way. The Middle East is where Africa, Asia and Europe meet. It is   where several major religions had their roots. The Middle East is   therefore the mirror where the world sees itself reflected. The   way conflicts are resolved there, or not resolved, are an   example, creating hope, or extinguishing it, in other regions.   That is why developments, and not least the activities of our   laureates, are watched with such anxious attention. Permit me to strike a brief personal note.   Raised as we were in Norway’s Protestant Christian tradition, we   had drilled into us already in primary school the history and   geography of two countries: Norway and “Palestine”. When I   visited the Middle East for the first time ten years ago, it felt   like coming to a country I had known for a long time. It was not   just that I had learned its complex and bloody history from the   Bible. With a child’s imagination. I had also built up memories   of the country. Jerusalem and Jericho were places where I had   been. At the same time, I bore within me the deep spiritual   unrest which awareness of the holocaust created in us Europeans.   The world community’s support for the establishment of the state   Israel was intended to right, and probably did right, some of the   wrongs committed. Yet I felt more unrest creeping into my mind,   not least at the sight of the deserted refugee camp near Jericho,   testimony that once again a people had taken to flight. Is there   no end to this history? Can no injustice be righted without   creating more injustice? Critics of this year’s choice of laureates   have said that the Nobel Committee is so distant from the   conflict that it cannot understand it. Perhaps. Probably only   those who live in the midst of the conflict know what that means.   On the other hand, solutions may be easier to see for those who   have a wider view, and can watch events, in Ibsen’s1 words, “through a hollowed hand, to gain   a better perspective”. The problem is rather that it is so   difficult to reconcile these perspectives. But that is exactly   what this year’s laureates have done. Although living in the   conflict, they have retained the ability to look beyond it. In the committee’s view, the so-called Oslo   Accords2 concluded last year   between Israel and the PLO meant that developments in the Middle   East had taken a new turning. What was revolutionary about them   was the de facto mutual recognition by the two parties. Not least   by virtue of that recognition, the accords opened up a possible   way out of the vicious circle of violence breeding violence, and   towards peaceful co-existence. Since the accords were concluded,   developments have become more dynamic. This applies both to   relations between Israel and the Palestinian people, and to   relations between Israel and the neighbouring Arab states. The   Oslo Accords have, as Prime Minister Rabin said at the press   conference yesterday, opened up for a normalization of relations   with the entire world. It has been said that the Nobel Committee   ought to have waited. But to say that is to disregard what has   already been achieved as a result of the Oslo Accords – in all   the areas mentioned. Besides, if we had to wait for what   Kant3 in his famous essay called   “perpetual peace”, we might have to wait a long time. Peace has   to be perpetually won. That means that every award must contain   an element of entering into a process, a process with a promise   of peace. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded both in recognition of   efforts which have been made, and to encourage still further   efforts. There can be no doubt that that is also how Alfred Nobel   intended the prize to work. The Committee considers this year’s three   laureates to have been the persons most responsible for the Oslo   Accords and for following them up. They watched the negotiations   from day to day, and took the difficult and fateful decisions on   what concessions to make to the other party. In a situation   marked by war and hatred, they had to take the risk of showing   their opposite numbers at least a minimum of trust, trust that   the peace feelers were genuine, confidence that if they offered   an outstretched hand, there would be someone there to take it. On   that bet they staked their political lives. That takes great   courage. For such negotiating games to succeed, there has to be a   kind of symmetry. Both sides need to be able to feel that the   give and take will end up roughly even. It is chiefly thanks to   the three laureates that this delicate balance has been achieved.   Concession must be followed by concession, or the process will   come to a halt. So far, both parties have given a great deal. Our   hope as the process continues is that neither will be driven to   breaking these “rules of the game”. For various reasons, which are none too   clear, and which I shall not consider here, the world attaches   considerable prestige to the Nobel Peace Prize. That can make it   all too tempting for the Nobel Committee to slip, as it were,   into moral judges’ robes. We are indeed often called upon, and   from many quarters, to be just that – moral judges. Permit me to   note that we seek to perform our appointed duties with great   humility. For the distant viewer, and perhaps especially for the   distant viewer from a privileged and peaceful corner of the   world, it is so easy to moralise – a bit too easy. Personally, I   am convinced that one reason for the prestige won by the Peace   Prize is that moralising arrogance has been avoided. In this way   one has been able to support the real moral project – peace. The   intention has been, not to judge or to hand out certificates of   good conduct, but simply to reward practical work for peace, in   accordance with Nobel’s own guidelines. Right from the start, the committee has   given practical peace work a broad definition. The range extends   from humanitarian work via work for human rights to political   action which helps to prevent or stop or resolve conflicts. And   it is precisely in this last important area that our laureates   have intervened, so forcefully and with such courage. Hatred and   violence breed hatred and violence. The Middle East was deep in   that vicious circle; more and more minds seemed possessed by it.   But, as we see, there are some who are strong enough to break   out, who manage to stop to think, who turn around and go back on   their tracks in search of a basis for peaceful co-existence.   Perhaps they are the most deserving of respect and admiration.   Were we not taught that such homecomings should be the cause of   the greatest rejoicing? On a previous occasion of this kind, I   recalled the reflections of the British poet and intellectual   Stephen Spender when he took part in the Spanish civil war. For   him the fight against fascism was a just cause, but a point came   when he stopped and discovered to his horror what a brutalising   effect the war was having on him. “It was clear to me”, he wrote   later, “that unless I cared about every murdered child   impartially, I did not care about children being murdered at   all”.4 Spender was strong enough   to conduct that kind of cathartic selfexamination, and to break   out of the vicious circle he had been trapped in. This is not attempt on my part to sum up   the characters of our laureates, much less to speculate about   their deeper motives for doing what they have done, which they   may not even know themselves. All I am trying to do is to suggest   how complex the situation is and how difficult it is to pass   judgement. But my main errand is different, more limited but   perhaps at least as important: to call attention to the boldness   and consistency of the political initiatives taken by the three   laureates ever since the opening of the Oslo negotiations. The three prize-winners are all in   positions in which they have power to intervene in the course of   events. But their positions are also exposed. Despite that, they   have used them to attempt together to change the direction of   developments, to break out of the vicious circle of hatred and   violence, and to point out a path to reconciliation. As leaders   they represent and mobilise the longing for peace which of course   exists in both peoples. The past cannot be forgotten, but one can   take various attitudes to it. One can choose to live in its   shadow, or to make use of its experience to build a better   future. Our laureates have chosen the latter, and so far they   have succeeded: developments have taken a new turning. The situation is still full of tension,   marked by violence, killings, and insecurity, and stability is   still far to seek. Nevertheless, our laureates have not only   shown that a road to reconciliation can be found, but also very   bravely taken several steps down that road. It is in admiration   of that effort, and in the hope that the process they have   started will continue, that they are today being awarded the   Nobel Peace Prize."
"68","1995","Joseph Rotblat, Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs"," Your Majesties, Your Excellencies, Ladies   and Gentlemen,    Our world has for fifty years now been living in the knowledge   that weapons exist powerful enough to wipe out human life on   earth. The atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki meant the   end of the Second World War, but also changed man’s relation to   his surroundings. Man’s creature, his liberating technology,   turned against him. The huge threat was clear enough for anyone   to see who could bear to look. Indeed the United Nations’ first   resolution, unanimously adopted by the General Assembly on the   24th of January 1946, concerned the establishment of a commission   to propose the elimination of nuclear arms and other weapons of   mass destruction.1 It may be worth reminding one another of   the fact that nuclear weapons have been used in war,   admittedly in an extreme situation, but not by an irrational   despot or under the naïve illusion of their relative   innocence. Extreme situations may arise again. What guarantee is   there that nuclear weapons will not be used again? In the short   term, the risk can be lessened by reducing nuclear arsenals. But   the longer-term aim must be to destroy all such weapons, as the   United Nations   argued in 1946. Since we have no way of banning knowledge   concerning nuclear weapons, the only guarantee that they will   never be used is, in the last analysis, probably a world without   war. It is considerations of this nature which   principally underlie the unwearying activity of our Laureates: in   Joseph Rotblat’s case, since his departure from the Manhattan   Project in 1944,2 and in the case   of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, since   the first meeting in 1957. It is a great pleasure to me to   welcome our Peace Prize Laureates. We do so in admiration of your   efforts over a long period of time, and recognising that your   activities remain as necessary today as they have ever been. In his own eyes, Alfred Nobel was   principally a practical man of science. He also lived at a time   of scientific optimism. As many as three of the prizes he   founded, to be awarded to those whose work had been of the   greatest benefit to mankind, accordingly went to scientists.   Ironically enough, however, his own scientific work was not   unquestionably beneficial to humanity. Dynamite made more   powerful weapons possible. As the morally aware man he was, Nobel   was troubled by this, and in his efforts to justify his activity,   he also toyed with the doctrine of deterrence. More powerful   weapons would keep man from waging war. When he wrote his will, however, exactly   one hundred years ago, the peace he envisaged was of a completely   different kind. Nothing is said about peace based on fear,   deterrence, or a balance of power. The conditions for peace are   now seen as disarmament and fraternity, in other words the   elimination of fear and the promotion of a peaceful mentality   rooted in the human spirit. It is work for this kind of peace   that Nobel wanted the Norwegian Nobel Committee to honour. The   will is based on a concept of peace with a moral content. That   does not mean discounting the need to take practical politics   into account, but is a reminder of their limitations, and of the   equally self-evident place of moral considerations in   international politics, as in any of this world’s other   complicated sets of circumstances. To set any sector of human   activity apart from the moral sphere is to deny our humanity. Without over-doing the comparison, we can   see parallels between Nobel and today’s laureate, Joseph Rotblat.   Both were scientists who clearly recognised their responsibility,   as scientists, to society. Rotblat is a prominent nuclear   physicist who was quick to realise the alarming potential of   releasing nuclear energy. During World War II, he took part in   realising that potential, an activity which, as a moral person,   he felt bound to justify by arguing that Hitler must be prevented   from developing an atom bomb first. When it became clear that   Hitler would be unable to develop a bomb, Rotblat left the   Manhattan Project before it had achieved that object. What this   shows is not just a man with personal integrity and great moral   courage, but also the interesting idea that it was not necessary   to develop the atom bomb, even when one knew that it was   theoretically possible. It was not necessary to let the genie out   of the bottle. Man must not imagine that he has no choice when he   can in fact choose. However, the genie was let out of   the bottle. Since then, alongside his commitment to nuclear   disarmament, Rotblat has engaged in nuclear physics which, when   put to medicinal uses, can find beneficial applications. He has   among other things, worked on radiation biology and the efforts   of radiation. Rotblat has arrived at a critical view of the   deterrence strategy with which he justified his original   engagement in the Manhattan Project. He was one of the eleven   scientists who in 1955 signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto,   drawn up by Bertrand Russell and   Albert Einstein,   which told us that we must think in new ways to avoid military   confrontations the results of which would be destructive to all   parties. The Manifesto was the immediate point of departure for   the Pugwash movement. Rotblat has been the leading figure in that   movement, of which he is today, at the age of 87, the very active   president. The Pugwash Conferences on Science and   World Affairs are first and foremost an organisation of   scientists. This makes them one of the clearest manifestations of   the independent social and moral responsibility of scientists for   what they, and they alone, are capable of developing. Even today,   recognition of that responsibility is not a matter of course. The   message from Pugwash to science is a double one: it must engage   actively in the struggle against the harmful consequences of   earlier scientific discoveries, and it must assess in advance the   consequences of new ones. Modern science is taking enormous   strides. The idea of its moral responsibility may be more   relevant today than ever before. It is characteristic of the Pugwash   movement that it has always combined ideals and long-term aims   with concrete work aimed at more immediate targets. It has only   to a limited extent sought public and media attention, and it is   not tied into the political decision-making process. What it has   been able to make the most of is the fact that scientists have a   shared frame of reference and speak the same language across   ideological, religious or national dividing lines. At the   countless conferences and seminars beld all over the world,   scientists and decision-makers with different points of departure   have got together to discuss strategies, not only for nuclear   disarmament, but also for general disarmament and other ways of   promoting peace. Although working largely behind the scenes, the   Pugwash movement has been close to decision-makers. It has served   as a channel of communication for them and, by virtue of its   expertise and insight, a supplier of premises for their   discussions. The Pugwash movement probably played a not   insignificant part in the processes which led to such important   arms-limitation agreements as the nuclear test ban treaty in   1963, the non-proliferation treaty in 1968, and SALT I and the   convention on biological weapons in 1972.3 Through its unwearying long-term   efforts, it has also been a major contributor to the change of   mentality so essential to the nuclear disarmament that has taken   place since the end of the Cold War. START I and START II and the   agreement to make the non-proliferation treaty permanent have   meant a significant reduction in the nuclear threat.4 But existing stocks remain far too   large, new nuclear arms are still being tested, and the danger   that such weapons will spread remains considerable. The Pugwash   movement has shown itself well able to adapt to the new world.   The Pugwash Conference in Hiroshima this year said that, although   there were favourable developments, the situation was unsettled.   We have opportunities, but they must be grasped and made use of   before developments again take an unfavourable turn. Precisely   the kind of work that Pugwash has been and is engaged in is   therefore still just as necessary, if not more necessary than   ever before. We are living today in what has been called   “the global village”. The fate of each one of us is intimately   linked to world developments. Events on the other side of the   world concern us as never before. At the same time, the “global   village” is what the German sociologist Ulrich Beck has called a   “risk society”.5 We share a common   fate in that we are all exposed to the same risk, the same   threats to our common environment. This is creating an atmosphere   of fundamental unease. But what do we do when we see no chance of   avoiding the danger? In the long run says Beck, we can stop   thinking about it: “this eschatological ecofatalism allows the   pendulum of private and political moods to swing in any   direction. The risk society shifts between hysteria and apathy”.   The greatest achievement of our laureates may be that, more   distinctly and consistently than anyone else, they have steered   clear of both pitfalls. While painting a clear picture of the   great dangers, they have at the same time insisted that there is   a way out. The have kept the vision of a nuclearfree world alive,   while working unwearyingly for specific arms-limitation measures   in the short term. By doing so, they have enabled us to adopt a   rational attitude both to the dangerous situation and to our own   disquiet. The work which the two laureates, Joseph   Rotblat and the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs,   have done and are doing for disarmament and peace is   considerable. The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to honour them   for that work, and at the same time to express the hope that it   will be continued, so that the disarmament which has begun may at   some future time really lead to a more peaceful world free from   nuclear arms.

"69","1996","Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, José Ramos-Horta","    Translation of the Norwegian text Your Majesties, Presidents, Excellencies,   Ladies and Gentlemen,    On behalf of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, may I extend to   everyone a warm welcome to this year’s Nobel Peace Prize   ceremony. It is one hundred years to the day since Alfred Nobel   died. A year earlier, he had drawn up his will, in which he   determined that his considerable wealth should provide for annual   awards of five prizes, three for science, one for literature, and   one for peace, to those whose work, as he wrote, “shall have   conferred the greatest benefit on mankind”. It was also laid down   in the will that the Peace Prize should be awarded in Norway by a   committee appointed by the Norwegian Storting. Our thoughts today   go also to Stockholm, where the other awards are being made, and   where the centenary is being marked of the death of Alfred   Nobel. Nobel was, of course, an unusually   successful businessman. But that was not where his heart lay. His   happiest times were spent in the laboratory. Inventions, it has   been said, became for him a way of life. He was also very widely   read. He was in other words greatly interested, indeed a   believer, in science and literature. What was remarkable was his   moral approach to those activities, which he saw as opportunities   for promoting a better world. This perspective emerges most   clearly in his decision concerning a peace prize. It can be   argued that the invention of dynamite, and concern at the more   powerful weapons which it made possible, contributed to his   increasing commitment to peace. But there were other impulses,   too, impulses which appealed to his deeply rooted moral   instincts, first and foremost his contact with the future Peace   Prize Laureate Bertha   von Suttner and with the contemporary peace movement. Nobel left an important inheritance,   consisting of a vision of a better world, and an award   institution which was to contribute to the realisation of that   vision. We who have been entrusted with managing that inheritance   do so in humility and with deep respect for the man Alfred Nobel,   whose memory we honour today. It is with great pleasure, and in the   conviction that with this year’s choice we have managed Nobel’s   inheritance in the best possible way, that we welcome our Peace   Prize Laureates today. Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and Jose   Ramos-Horta have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1996 for   their long-lasting efforts to achieve a just and peaceful   solution to the twenty-year-old conflict in East Timor. To reach   this peaceful winterland Norway, you have come about as far from   your home country as it is possible to travel on this earth. Yet   the distance between us is much shorter in miles than in   opportunities for peace, justice and reconciliation. We are   grateful and proud that, in the middle of your important and   self-sacrificing work, you have found time for the journey here,   thereby giving us this opportunity to honour you. The conflict in East Timor has been called   “the forgotten conflict”. It has not, however, been completely   forgotten, having figured on the international agenda, with   varying degrees of prominence, throughout those twenty years. But   it has so to speak never caught on. There have been so many other   interests and regards to attend to, and East Timor is so small.   Rarely has the cynicism of world politics been more clearly   demonstrated. The numerous considerations of “Realpolitik” have   enabled an exceptionally brutal form of neocolonialism to take   place. Of a population of between six and seven hundred thousand,   nearly two hundred thousand have died as the direct or indirect   result of the Indonesian occupation. And the violations are still   taking place today. Many are the countries which have given   higher priority to their “Realpolitical” cooperation with   Indonesia than to regard for East Timor. This is the apparently   hopeless situation in which our two Laureates have so untiringly   striven for a just and peaceful arrangement for their people. The autumn of 1975 was fateful for East   Timor. First the old colonial masters, the Portuguese, withdrew.   Then an internal struggle broke out between the Timorese   Democratic Union on the one hand and the Fretilin liberation   movement on the other. And the autumn ended with the Indonesian   invasion. In the twenty-one years that have passed since, this   conquest of a country and a people has never been internationally   recognised. Ramos-Horta was a Fretilin leader, one of the   moderates whose ideal was social democracy. During the so-called   civil war, he was out of the country, and on his return in   September he tried to reconcile the parties. Since the invasion   he has lived abroad, unceasingly and with great personal   sacrifice collecting and communicating information on the   repression, torture and killing in his home country, and acting   as East Timor’s principal international spokesman. At the same   time he has successfully kept up his efforts to unite the various   East Timorese groups in a single national front, while constantly   seeking opportunities for a peaceful solution to the conflict   with Indonesia, based on respect for the integrity of the East   Timorese people. “We used to joke that he was more an informal   member of the Democratic Union than a Fretilin leader,” says   Union leader Joao Carrascalao. The remark illustrates the part   played by Ramos-Horta as a mediator and conciliator. No serious   negotiations aimed at resolving the conflict are conceivable   today without the participation of Ramos-Horta or one of his   aides, as Bishop Belo has also emphasised. As a relatively unknown priest, Bishop Belo   was appointed Apostolic Administrator for the Roman Catholic   church in East Timor in 1983, since when he has served on his   home ground. Again and again, in the midst of everyday terror and   suffering, he has intervened, trying to reconcile and mediate and   lessen confrontation, and in doing so he has saved many lives.   Intervening in a violent conflict entails a risk of being crushed   between the antagonists. “Pray for me, please,” he said in one   such situation, “because now I have to defend myself on both   sides”. But Bishop Belo has become much more than a mediator:   this man of peace has also become a rallying point for his sorely   tried people, a representative of their hope for a better future.   The love his people feel for this mediator springs from certain   fundamental principles he has adhered to. Show the people   respect. Give them freedom to develop their humanity to the full.   Then ask them whether they want to be Indonesians, Portuguese, or   independent. Bishop Belo shares with his people the insight of   the oppressed, an insight deeper than that of generals or   oppressors. Why all this brutality? It does not even serve its   purpose. You do not gain respect if you do not show respect. This year has seen the commemoration, forty   years on, of the Soviet Union’s brutal crushing of the popular   rising in Hungary in 1956. The West did not intervene. Since   Hungary lay within the Soviet sphere of interest, it was   necessary “Realpolitik” to accept the invasion. We would do well   to recall that at that time, a marking of the event forty years   later in a free Hungary lay beyond the bounds of what most people   thought possible. It has been said that Indonesia’s annexation of   East Timor is a historic fact. But history has never established   anything as a fact for ever. History always moves on. If we have   learned anything in the past decade, it must be that the most   repressive regimes are the most fragile. There are forces in   history more powerful than the strongest military force. Violence   and terror do not lead to peace. Not until one builds up the   courage to break out of the vicious circle of violence do   opportunities arise for an enduring peace. The right to live, the right to full   development as human beings, the right to respect, are at the   heart of the concept of human rights. Since the award of the   Nobel Peace Prize for 1960 to Albert Lutuli, work for   human rights has been one of the principal criteria for the   award. We have constantly received confirmation that this was the   right path to take, although the choice of this criterion has   also been criticised because it allegedly has nothing to do with   peace. But it is precisely in forging a close link between the   human rights criterion and peace that we believe we are realising   that criterion’s most universal and most fundamental aspects.   Peace, stability and harmony must be based on mutual respect.   That, so simple and so universal, is the message. Once it has   been heard, the next step is to institutionalise the respect, in   various ways according to cultural traditions. Violence, on the   other hand, systematic violence on the part of those in power,   can never be justified within the framework of a universal   concept of human rights. That is a fact to which the victims of   violence could testify. Never forget to listen to the voice of   the victims, the voice of the nearly two hundred thousand whose   lives were lost in massacres or from the hunger and want which   resulted from the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. This year’s two Peace Prize Laureates,   Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and Jose Ramos-Horta, have laboured   tirelessly, and with great personal sacrifice, for their   oppressed people. Under extremely difficult conditions, they have   preserved their humanity and faith in the future. It is in   admiration of their work and in the hope for a better future for   East Timor that the Norwegian Nobel Committee today honours them   with the Nobel Peace Prize for 1996.

"70","1997","International Campaign to Ban Landmines, Jody Williams","    Translation of the Norwegian text. Your Majesties, Excellencies, Ladies and   Gentlemen,    There are those among us who are unswerving in their faith that   things can be done Io make our world a better, safer, and more   humane place, and who also, even when the tasks appear   overwhelming, have the courage to tackle them. Such people   deserve our admiration, and our gratitude. We are delighted and   honoured to welcome some of them to the Oslo City Hall today. Our   warm welcome to you, the representatives of the ICBL, the   International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and to you, Jody   Williams, the campaign’s strongest single driving force. You have   not only dared to tackle your task, but also proved that, the   impossible is possible. You have helped to rouse public opinion   all over the world against the use of an arms technology that   strikes quite randomly at the most innocent and most defenceless.   And you have opened up the possibility that this wave of opinion   can be channelled into political action. We all know that the largest part of the   task still lies ahead. Many nations, among them the largest, have   been reluctant, at least so far, to commit themselves to not   using this weapon. There is still the almost hopelessly huge and   resource-consuming task of destroying the landmines-over one   hundred million of them-that have been deployed. And the effort   to build up opportunities for dignified lives for the many   millions of innocent mine victims has only just begun. But   through your self-sacrificing work, you have won support and   created an organization that lead us to believe that it will be   possible to reach the goal: a world completely free from   anti-personnel mines. The course has been set, and the   inspiration given. That is no small achievement, but a first step   of very great and perhaps decisive importance. That step is what   we honour you for today. The mobilisation and focussing of broad   popular involvement which we have witnessed bears promise that   goes beyond the present issue. It appears to have established a   pattern for how to realise political aims at the global level.   The ICBL is an umbrella organization for over one thousand   nongovernmental organizations, large and small, which have taken   up the cause. The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to honour them   all, and to draw attention to the impact which such broad   coordination can achieve. A second characteristic feature of this   process that ought to be noted is how, in the next instance, the   political level was mobilised. A week ago, in Ottawa, 121   countries signed the total ban on anti-personnel mines. Through   Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, the Government of Canada took   the deci- sive initiative in that mobilisation when, in October   1996, it invited all countries to the Ottawa meeting. “Such a   treaty,” Axworthy said in connection with the invitation, “can be   a powerful force that establishes the moral norm – that the   production, use, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines   is to be banned forever.” The strategy adopted, in other words,   was not to water the treaty down with a lot of exceptions aimed   at inducing the hesitant to join in, but to convey a clear   message. Though this may have frightened some countries off, it   has of course, because of the overwhelming support for the   process, placed the larger nations under considerable political   pressure. The problem of landmines has been on the   international agenda for a long time. It was discussed in 1980,   in connection with the Landmine Protocol to the Conventional   Weapons Convention. It was when negotiations on the revision of   that Protocol were being held in 1995-96 that frustration at the   lack of progress made itself felt. In November 1991, the Vietnam Veterans of   America Foundation in Washington D.C. and Medico International in   Frankfurt agreed to launch a campaign aimed at banning   anti-personnel mines. When the first International Conference on   Landmines was held in London in May 1993, representatives of 40   voluntary organizations attended. The following year, in Geneva,   75 organizations were represented. Today, over one thousand   organizations are members of the ICBL. It was by hooking into   this popular involvement that the Ottawa process came to mark a   new political beginning, lifting the cause out of the backwater   it had drifted into. It is interesting to watch this initiative   apparently feeding back into the United Nations and the whole system of   international negotiations, and giving them new life. Effective   political action is dependent on cooperation at several levels.   At the national level, that is old news, first given memorable   expression over 150 years ago by de Tocqueville in his famous   analysis of democracy in America. Representative political bodies   can not carry on politics in a vacuum. They need in some way or   other to be rooted in public opinion. And public opinion must be   formed and directed by the active involvement of individual   members of society in society’s manifold organizations or   associations. These are the fundamental institutional elements of   what we have learned to know as – a civil society. The problem at the international level is   that no global civil society has existed. Perhaps it is not so   surprising that the UN has not always been able to be as   effective as we might have wished. But in the extensive   cooperation we have been registering between the multitude of   nongovernmental organizations, the many national governments, and   the international political system, first and foremost the UN, we   may be seeing the outline of what may turn into a global civil   society. We have glimpsed similar features in other connections,   but hardly as clearly as in this particular case. In the bold   hope this gives us for further development in the same direction,   we see promising signs of a more peaceful world. How did landmines come to be the problem   that generated this kind of international concern? Weapons exist   that in many ways are more terrible and pose a greater threat,   nuclear weapons in particular. And is it not the case that by   banning certain types of weapon, one indirectly legitimises the   use of others, and thereby also legitimises war? What sort of   peace policy is it just to ban certain types of weapon? Certainly we have seen similar types of   commitment, directed against nuclear weapons in particular, and   the Norwegian Nobel Committee has on a number of occasions, most   recently in 1995, called attention to active opposition to the   build-up of nuclear arms. There is a vast difference between   nuclear weapons and landmines. The former are the weapons of the   rich, the latter of the poor. Yet they also have something in   common. Both hit victims at a vast remove from the actual   warfare. They strike mainly at civilian populations, and their   effects continue for generations after the end of the armed   conflict. They are weapons which cast the shadow of war also   across peace. War’s threat to life and limb is everywhere and   never-ending. To set limits to war’s repercussions for civilian   populations and its impact on times of peace has always been an   important aim of genuine work for peace. At this very time, while nuclear war casts   its shadow over us all – and perhaps for that very reason has   remained an unrealised threat since 1945 -landmines are exploding   every single day. Nearly all those killed or maimed are the   poorest and most defenceless among us, and probably number some   26,000 each year. Yet the most alarming aspect of the situation   may not be that total itself, but the constant threat to the much   larger numbers who live in the danger zones, who do not know   where they can send their children out to play, or who can only   gather fuel or work in the fields at great risk to their own   lives. Such people have been robbed of the opportunity to use the   land to build their own societies. The ICBL and Jody Williams’ work is work   for disarmament. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has frequently   honoured disarmament efforts, or work for the “reduction of   standing armies”, to use Nobel’s own words. Disarmament reduces   tension and thereby the threat of war. The work of the ICBL and   Jody Williams is, however, primarily aimed at what I have just   mentioned: sheltering civilian populations from war. It is a   humanitarian project. The Norwegian Nobel Committee’s tradition   of honouring humanitarian efforts goes right back to the first   Peace Prize, awarded in 1901 to Henri Dunant, the founder   of the Red   Cross. Humanitarian work prevents war by seeking to eliminate   the underlying causes of violence and war, the causes in the   human mind. A humanitarian effort aims at “fraternity between   nations”, again to quote Nobel. It is a hand outstretched to the   victims, both those who have been maimed and those in danger. It   is a demonstration of care and compassion that transcends all   national boundaries. It is a paradox that what we find inside   landmines is Nobel’s brilliant invention, dynamite. Nobel was a   profoundly moral man, and was deeply concerned about the   potential of dynamite in weapons technology. At one time he   developed a doctrine of deterrence. He wrote to his close friend,   the peace activist Bertha von Suttner, that   perhaps his factories were more effective in preventing war than   her peace congresses. He can not have been completely convinced,   however. When he decided to establish a peace prize, the idea   probably came from Bertha von Suttner, and it was not a   fear-ridden peace he wished to honour, but a peace of   reconciliation and brotherhood. The inspiration from Bertha von   Suttner is reflected in the special mention given in his will to   the organization of peace congresses as a criterion for the   award. Bertha von Suttner was to become the first woman Laureate   when she was awarded the Peace Prize herself in 1905, after   Nobel’s death. There have not been many women among the   Laureates, and no doubt there should have been more. But let us   at least take credit for having made an early start. With her   self-sacrificing, untiring and fruitful service to humanity and   peace, Jody Williams is a worthy successor to Bertha von Suttner,   who inspired the Peace Prize and brought Nobel to the realisation   that peace must be rooted in the human mind. An important step has been taken. The vast   problem of landmines has effectively been placed on the   international agenda. The worldwide opinion has been formed that   something must be done about the problem. And the practical work   of freeing the world from landmines has begun. It is in   admiration, and in gratitude for their efforts to achieve that   aim that we honour the ICBL and Jody Williams today with the   Nobel Peace Prize for 1997. The vast and laborious task of   putting an end to the production and sale of mines, destroying   existing mines, and helping the victims has, however, only just   begun. Let us therefore also express the hope that the process   will win still greater support, so that the work can be   intensified and a world without antipersonnel mines can become a   reality in the foreseeable future."
"71","1998","John Hume, David Trimble","    Translation of the Norwegian text. Your Majesties, Excellencies, Ladies and   Gentlemen,    On Good Friday this year, an agreement was signed which has   rightly been seen as a breakthrough in the efforts to achieve a   peaceful solution to the long-lasting conflict in Northern   Ireland. In the referendum on 25 May, the agreement won the   support of a large majority of the people, and in June elections   were held to the Northern Ireland Assembly according to the   principles laid down in the agreement. This autumn, formerly   irreconcilable enemies have attended the Assembly together.    We all know that major problems still lie ahead, and that the new   constitutional foundation for the peaceful resolution of   conflicts is brittle. This autumn, too, we have witnessed   terrorist attacks in which several people have been killed. But   it does seem as if these have been isolated occurrences, and that   they have only served to strengthen the general demand for   building on the foundations for peaceful solutions laid in the   Good Friday agreement. The IRA cease-fire, an important condition   for progress towards peace, remains in force. So, although we are   aware that things can change rapidly in our unsettled world, the   situation has been a different one since Good Friday of this   year. The vicious circle of violence has been broken. The peace   process has built up a momentum of its own which makes a return   to earlier conditions of terror unlikely, although we must be   prepared for minor setbacks as the process continues.    The Norwegian Nobel Committee has chosen two men who in its   opinion should be specially honoured for their contributions to   the peace process, John Hume and David Trimble. It is with great   pleasure that we welcome you to our cold but peaceful north to   receive the Nobel Peace Prize for 1998. You are foremost among   the many who have placed themselves at the service of peace, in   and outside Northern Ireland.    John Hume and David Trimble are both from Northern Ireland, where   they have lived with and in the conflict. They are both prominent   politicians, leaders respectively of the two largest political   parties in Northern Ireland, parties which represent the two   groups in a divided population. They have both committed   themselves to the course which the Good Friday agreement   represents: that conflicts must be solved by peaceful means. The   strong support for the agreement in the referendum shows that   they made the right choice.    Political leadership is not to trim your sail to every wind; it   is to initiate movement, and to act at the right time. Like other   political leaders, the two Laureates have both helped to build   confidence that it is possible to arrive at reasonable   compromises by peaceful means. As political leaders, they are   guarantors to their constituents that peaceful methods will lead   to solutions which both sides can live with, and live better than   if a state of war had continued. In a tense situation, such   exposed positions require large amounts of both wisdom and   courage. Today’s Laureates have shown both.    But there are differences between them. In 1970, at a time of   spiralling violence, John Hume played a part in the foundation of   the party of which he became the unquestioned leader, the Social   Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). It is a nationalist party,   but it has stood firmly throughout for the principle that only   peaceful means must be used. More than anyone else, Hume is the   architect behind the peace process and the solution chosen in the   Good Friday agreement. He has held unwaveringly to the line that   discussions and institutional solutions have to be inclusive.   Even those who had chosen violent means in their political   struggle had to be given opportunities to participate in the   peace process, to change their strategy, and to be taken at their   word when they did so. Especially during periods of escalating   violence, Hume has had to swallow sometimes very harsh criticism,   from within his own ranks as well as from others, for his gentle   approach to the hard-liners. But with his personal integrity,   Hume has stood firm, and his policy has won through.    The Northern Irish Nobel Laureate in Literature, Seamus Heaney, used   the fable of the hedgehog and the fox to describe our two   Laureates and the difference between them. “John Hume is the   hedgehog, who knew the big truth that justice had to prevail,” he   wrote. David Trimble, on the other hand, “is the fox, who has   known many things, but who had the intellectual clarity and   political courage to know that 1998 was the time to move unionism   towards an accommodation with reasonable and honourable   nationalist aspirations. In so doing, he opened the possibility   of a desirable and credible future for all the citizens of   Northern Ireland.” When he was elected leader of Northern   Ireland’s traditionally largest party, the Ulster Unionist Party   (UUP), Trimble was a relative newcomer to top-level politics. He   was known as an uncompromising unionist, but soon showed that he   had other political sides to him, and clearly felt that the   situation demanded more flexible attitudes on the part of the   unionists. Under his leadership, enough fear and suspicion was   overcome to enable a majority of unionists to rally behind the   Good Friday agreement. I need hardly add that Trimble, too, has   come in for strong criticism for his conciliatory approach.    Only those who have themselves experienced having their rights   trampled on, who have seen their loved ones killed, who have had   to live with loss, fear and suspicion, only they can fully grasp   what it means to live under such conditions or wholly understand   the reactions such a situation provokes. In her book “A Strategy   for Peace”, the philosopher Sissela Bok, daughter of Peace Prize   Laureate Alva   Myrdal, writes about what she calls “The Pathology of   Partisanship”, about how war can create in us a mental state   which leaves us devoid of respect, even of pity, for even the   most innocent victims. She recalls the writer Stephen Spender’s   horror at finding that pathological condition in himself in the   Spanish Civil War. Only through strong leadership and   institutional guarantees can a society withstand such   destructiveness, Sissela Bok concludes.    We who are looking on from the outside must be humble and slow to   judge – judging is not our business. But the conflict does also   involve us. It tells us something about ourselves by bringing   general human features to light. The pathology of partisanship is   one such feature. It tells us something about why violence   engenders violence. It is remarkable, and promising, that despite   such a cycle, despite the extremes in Northern Ireland, we are   seeing more and more individuals standing up and proclaiming that   forgiveness and reconciliation are more important than   retaliation. Looking about us in the world, we see that people   seeking peace following a violent past generally seem to find   that the cry for justice must be subordinated to the call for   reconciliation and amnesty. That is what we have learned for   instance from South Africa. And who, after all, are the just in a   situation like the one in Northern Ireland, with two clashing   views of reality? Meanwhile we also learn, with Sissela Bok, how   important strong leadership and institutional guarantees are in   building up that desire for reconciliation which can move us away   from a state of violence. Our Laureates stand for such   leadership.    I have already mentioned that they have both been criticised for   their moderate and inclusive approach. There has been so much   fear and suspicion that for many it has become difficult to   believe in the other party’s good intentions. The adoption of an   inclusive strategy implies a deliberate break with suspicion, a   disregard for fear. That, precisely, is the strategy of   reconciliation. No doubt there are situations in which it is   naive to believe in the other party’s good faith. To do so may be   risky. But a real peace process needs people who are willing to   take that risk. We need the bold – or, if you will, the credulous   – people who are willing to stretch out a hand. It is surprising   to see what a disarming effect innocence can sometimes have on   the other party.    In addition to leadership, we need institutional guarantees,   again according to Sissela Bok. The Good Friday agreement   provides institutional guarantees. It neither represents nor was   intended to represent any agreement at the substantive level.   Unionists are still unionists and nationalists are still   nationalists. What they have acquired are institutions for the   peaceful resolution of conflicts.    Permit me a brief parallel with our own experience. In 1814,   Norway was forced into a union with Sweden. War broke out on   Norwegian soil between the Norwegian peasant army and the   professional Swedish army which had returned from the continent   after helping to defeat Napoleon. The fighting in Norway was   brought to an end when the great powers intervened. They decided,   Great Britain among them, that Norway must enter the union. But   Norway was allowed to retain her new constitutional system.   Armaments were replaced by political institutions. To reverse   Clausewitz’s famous aphorism, politics became the continuation of   war by other means. Ninety-one years later, the union was   peacefully dissolved. The peaceful relation between the two   parties was given symbolic expression when the Swede Nobel made   the Norwegians responsible for awarding the Peace Prize.    In 1977, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the Peace Prize   for 1976 to Mairead   Corrigan and Betty Williams, Northern Ireland’s Peace People.   It has since been said that the time was not ripe. This time,   too, we have heard that our choice may be premature, that lasting   peace is still far to seek. The argument is easy to understand,   and nothing could have pleased us more than to have been able to   say today that peace was certain. But in connection with these   awards, as with a number of others, the Committee bore in mind   Nobel’s clear intention that the prize should reflect current   affairs, and that it should advance the cause of peace. We know   that a peace process may be long and difficult and suffer   frequent reverses. In such processes, it is important to focus on   the advances, made perhaps against the odds, and on the persons   brave enough to stand up in a good cause. Reverses do not mean   that their efforts have been in vain. They may have laid the   foundations for renewed efforts at the next opportunity. That is   how peace is built, slowly, like drilling through hard wood as   Max Weber put it. The work along the way is just as important as   the finishing touch. And it is by drawing attention to the   present stage that one may perhaps contribute to further   progress.    Our two Laureates have done great work in the cause of good. They   have both shown great courage. So have many others: Gerry Adams,   Bertie Ahern, Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, to name just a few of   those who contributed most in the final stages of the process   leading to the Good Friday agreement. United States Senator   George Mitchell, who made such a significant contribution as a   mediator, gave an accurate description of the work of our two   Laureates, which I shall take the liberty of quoting: “Without   Mr. Hume, there would have been no peace process, without Mr.   Trimble, no agreement.” It is a privilege for us to be able to   honour you here today. At the same time, we know there are many   difficult tasks ahead. We take comfort from the fact that you   will still be heading the process, and that you enjoy good strong   support from many sides."
"72","1999","Médecins Sans Frontières","    Translation of the Norwegian text. Your Majesties, Your Royal Highness,   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen.    Few aims can be more praiseworthy than to combat suffering: to   help those in the most desperate situations, whatever their race   and wherever they may be, to return to a dignified life. Some   persons even have the necessary strength and drive to live up to   this ideal. We welcome a few of them today. We do so humbly,   recognising that they are representatives of a much greater   number of self-sacrificing men and women all over the world. Our   thoughts go not least to those who, at this very moment, are   working under the most difficult conditions, often putting their   own lives at risk, in scenes of the profoundest suffering and   degradation. Every year, Médecins Sans   Frontières send out over 2,500 doctors, nurses and other   professional helpers to more than 80 countries, where they   co-operate with a good 15,000 local personnel. They go where   need, suffering and hopelessness are greatest, indeed often   catastrophic in nature, regardless of whether the catastrophes   are human or natural in origin. We find them in the world’s   countless refugee camps, as well as among Chinese peasants,   Russian prisoners, or the western world’s modern city   slum-dwellers. They are present in large numbers in Africa   – the forgotten continent. The modest beginnings of Médecins Sans   Frontières go back to the early 1970s, and a small group of   French doctors formed under the leadership of Bernard Kouchner.   What triggered them was their experience of emergency aid work in   two disasters, one natural – the great flood in East   Pakistan (later Bangladesh) – and one man-made – the   cruel conflict in Biafra from 1967 to 1970. Some of the doctors   who provided emergency aid in those disaster areas were   frustrated at finding their work impeded by complicated   procedures and principles of neutrality. The new organisation   would have to be unbureaucratic, flexible, and willing to take   risks. Médecins Sans Frontières blazed   new trails in international humanitarian work. The organisation   reserved the right to intervene to help people in need   irrespective of prior political approval. The essential points   for Médecins Sans Frontières are to reach those in need   of help as quickly as possible, and to maintain impartiality.   They demand freedom to carry out their medical mandate, and to   decide for themselves whom to help according to purely   humanitarian criteria. What is more, they insist on making human   rights violations known. In addition to helping, in other words,   they also seek to draw attention to the causes of humanitarian   catastrophes. To alleviate distress one must also get to its   roots. These were new principles in the field of aid, and have   not been uncontroversial. Some said that this was to confuse the   issues in ways which might block access to suffering people.   Médecins Sans Frontières have been called emergency aid   rebels. The first Nobel Prizes were awarded in   1901, nearly a hundred years ago, at the beginning of the century   which will draw to a close in less than a month’s time. The first   Peace Prize went to Henri Dunant, founder of   the Red Cross, who shared it with the peace activist Frédéric Passy.   Dunant was goaded into action by happening to be an eye-witness   to the incredible carnage at the battle of Solferino in northern   Italy in 1859. The award to Dunant came in for criticism.   Humanitarian work was not relevant to peace, ran the argument,   but simply «humanised» war. There were, however,   grounds for the decision in Nobel’s will, which mentions   «fraternity between nations» as one of the criteria for   the Peace Prize. What better or more direct expression can there   be of this idea of fraternity than to hold out a helping hand to   a sufferer, regardless of identity or party? The peace Alfred Nobel was thinking of when   he established the prize was a peace that is rooted in men’s   hearts and minds. By showing each victim a human face, by showing   respect for his or her human dignity, the fearless and selfless   aid worker creates hope for peace and reconciliation. That brings   us to the heart of the matter, to absolutely fundamental   prerequisites for peace. The decision to award the first Peace   Prize to humanitarian work was one of the most important   decisions in the history of the prize. That we are continuing, at   the end of the century, and the millennium, to recognise   humanitarian work confirms that the course plotted then was the   right one. But in the meantime, the world has changed.   We are constantly having to face new challenges. The historian   Eric Hobsbawm has labelled the century which is now ending   «The Age of Extremes». What he has in mind is this   century’s totalitarian regimes. We have witnessed man-made   catastrophes that spread far beyond the battlefields, systematic   violations of human rights, ethnic cleansing and genocide. We   have been forced to acknowledge the close connection between war   or the threat of war and those systematic breaches of human   rights. The threat to peace, to real peace, was more extensive   than the peace campaigners had imagined at the beginning of the   century. This way of thinking began making itself   felt in international work after the second world war, but only   slowly. Measures against violations of human rights necessarily   present challenges to the established principle of   non-intervention. This principle has for a long time been   regarded as fundamental to peace work, and is still current,   although today it is being confronted ever more strongly by   demands for intervention against breaches of human rights. The   Norwegian Nobel Committee made its first purely human rights   award in 1960, to Albert Lutuli of South   Africa. Since then this has been a major criterion for Peace   Prize awards, as can be seen from the awards to Martin Luther King,   Andrei Sakharov,   Lech Walesa,   Aung San Suu Kyi,   and Carlos Belo,   among many others. Those awards, too, were criticised for not   being relevant to peace. Many of them gave rise to disputes and   protests, principally from the Laureates’ home countries, as   amounting to intervention in internal affairs. A characteristic feature of Médecins   Sans Frontières is that, more clearly than anyone else, they   combine in their work the two criteria we have mentioned,   humanitarian work and work for human rights. They achieve this by   insisting on their right to arouse public opinion and to point to   the causes of the man-made catastrophes, namely systematic   breaches of the most fundamental rights. The award to   Médecins Sans Frontières is first and foremost a   humanitarian award, maintaining the tradition that goes back to   the first award, but it is also a human rights award, and as such   it links up with more recent developments in the history of the   Peace Prize. Like the Nobel Committee’s human rights   awards, the exposures by Médecins Sans Frontières of   violations of human rights began during the cold war, when they   were chiefly aimed at the brutality of communist regimes. Since   the end of the cold war, the need for humanitarian intervention   has certainly not diminished; meanwhile, however, the situations   have grown more complex, more chaotic. «War» has turned   into something other, and much less clearly definable, than a   struggle between the armed forces of identifiable nations.   Military units have been dissolved into armed bands. It is often   difficult to name those responsible, or to find anyone to   negotiate with. And the victims of these wars are not first and   foremost the soldiers, as at Solferino, but the civilian   populations, the women and the children. The changed nature of war requires   reassessments of strategies for peace. Humanitarian   interventions, with or without peace-keeping or other forces, are   figuring ever more prominently in such strategies today.   Humanitarian interventions have also become important features of   the foreign policies of many states. In this connection,   voluntary organizations (NGOs) are finding ever more important   parts to play. But the politicization of aid work, with voluntary   organizations integrating ever more closely with governments, is   creating new problems. Situations may easily arise in which   motives are unclear and the allocation of functions can be   questioned. On the other hand, we hear talk of   «the humanitarian trap». How can you help the victims   without at the same time helping their executioners? There have   been cases of military groups imposing starvation on a region and   then stealing the aid when it arrives. There are brutal regimes   which deliberately exploit the aid organizations. Knowledge that   someone will care for them swells the flood of refugees –   which can contribute to ethnic cleansing. For these reasons,   Médecins Sans Frontières have on one or two occasions   withdrawn from involvement. The genocide in Rwanda in 1994 led to   a huge influx of refugees into the neighbouring state of Zaire.   Médecins Sans Frontières were on the spot throughout,   but for a time the organization withdrew from the refugee camps   in Zaire, in protest against the abuse of aid and the terrorising   of refugees by extremists. Médecins Sans Frontières   followed their protest up with an appeal to world opinion. That   was also the first occasion on which the organization called for   military intervention to put a stop to brutality. Médecins Sans Frontières are   generally highly critical of humanitarian intervention by   military force. They believe experience has shown them how a   humanitarian/military alliance can introduce the logic of war and   break down the humanitarian aspect of a mission. In some cases it   also increases the risk to the humanitarian aid workers   themselves, as happened in Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia.   Médecins Sans Frontières do not want military   protection, and all their vehicles are clearly marked with a   symbol showing that they are unarmed: a submachine-gun with a   heavy cross painted over it. Henri Dunant imagined that there was a   neutral zone, which lay outside the spheres of interest of the   warring parties and which one could therefore enter with   humanitarian aid. Today we see such «humanitarian   zones» invaded by both sides, obliging aid organizations to   make political choices and take positions on complicated moral   issues. It is precisely in such situations that it becomes   especially necessary to preserve one’s independence.   Médecins Sans Frontières are among the organisations   which attach the greatest importance to independence, insisting   among other things that half their revenues must come from   private donors. A large number of aid organisations are   extensively and selflessly engaged in alleviating suffering all   over the world. They all deserve our gratitude and our attention.   Médecins Sans Frontières have a distinctive profile,   and have managed to preserve many of their original virtues. They   are frequently the first to arrive at the scene of a disaster.   The organisation remains pervaded by idealism and willingness to   take great risks. It has kept its independence, and seeks   systematically to draw attention to violations and distress. Equally important is the fact that   Médecins Sans Frontières have indicated, more clearly   than any other organisation, how burdened aid work is in our   chaotic world with political and moral dilemmas. The organization   has tried in various ways to adapt to this, and has, sometimes   through provocative initiatives, set in motion an absolutely   essential discussion of the problematic nature of humanitarian   interventions, not only in their aims but also and chiefly in   their consequences. Good deeds are important, but they should   also lead to good results. Here as so often in life, a balance   has to be found between an ethics of conviction and an ethics of   responsibility. Through their strategy and their initiatives,   Médecins Sans Frontières have unquestionably influenced   the whole development of international aid work. Let us in conclusion remind ourselves that,   however chaotic a situation may be, or however difficult the   choices one faces, one consideration remains paramount. That is   to reduce distress and alleviate suffering. Médecins Sans   Frontières provide professional assistance –   efficiently – to people who are suffering or in need. The   organisation stands for an open helping hand, extended across   borders, through conflicts, and into political chaos. It is by   never compromising over this paramount mandate that one can   achieve outward legitimacy and inner inspiration. This   self-sacrificing commitment kindles in us all the belief that the   next century may be better and more peaceful than this century’s   age of extremism. It is this self-sacrificing effort which we   honour here today."
"73","2000","Kim Dae-jung","   Translation of the Norwegian text. Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for the year 2000 to Kim Dae-jung. He receives the prize for his lifelong work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular. We welcome the Laureate here today. The question has been raised of whether it is too early to award the prize for a process of reconciliation which has only just begun. It would suffice to say in reply that Kim Dae-jung’s work for human rights made him a worthy candidate irrespective of the recent developments in relations between the two Korean states. It is also clear, however, that his strong commitment to reconciliation with North Korea, and the results that have been achieved – especially in the past year – added a new and important dimension to Kim Dae-jung’s candidacy. While recognising that reverses in international peace work are something one has to be prepared for, the Nobel Committee nevertheless adheres to the principle: nothing ventured, nothing gained. The Peace Prize is a reward for the steps that have been taken so far. However, as so often before in the history of the Nobel Peace Prize, it is intended this year, too, as an encouragement to advance still further along the long road to peace and reconciliation. This is to a large extent a matter of courage: Kim Dae-jung has had the will to break with fifty years of ingrained hostility, and to reach out a cooperative hand across what has probably been the world’s most heavily guarded frontier. His has been the kind of personal and political courage which, regrettably, is all too often missing in other conflict-ridden regions. The same applies to peace work as to life in general when you set out to cross the highest mountains: the first steps are the hardest. But you can count on plenty of company along the glamorous finishing stretch. Gunnar Roaldkvam, a writer from Stavanger, puts this so simply and so aptly in his poem “The last drop”: Once upon a time
there were two drops of water;
one was the first,
the other the last. The first drop
was the bravest. I could quite fancy
being the last drop,
the one that makes everything
run over,
so that we get
our freedom back. But who wants to be
the first
drop? Today, Kim Dae-jung is the president of a democratic South Korea. His path to power has been long – extremely long. For decades he fought a seemingly hopeless fight against an authoritarian regime. One may well ask where he found the strength. His own answer is: “I used all my strength to resist the dictatorial regimes, because there was no other way to defend the people and promote democracy. I felt like a homeowner whose house was invaded by a robber. I had to fight the intruder with my bare hands to protect my family and property without thinking of my own safety.” In the 1950s, when Kim ran for election to the national assembly, the police were used to prevent support for any other candidates than the regime’s own. He was not elected until 1961, but that success was short-lived: a military coup three days later led to the dissolution of the assembly. But Kim did not give up. In 1963, after ten years of almost continuous political struggle, he finally took a seat in the national assembly as an opposition representative. The ruling party, it should be added, tried to buy him. Kim was not for sale. In 1971, Kim Dae-jung ran in the presidential election, winning 46 per cent of the votes despite considerable ballot-rigging. This made him a serious threat to the military regime. As a result, he spent many long years, first in prison, then in house arrest and in exile in Japan and the United States. He also underwent kidnapping and assassination attempts. Somehow enduring all these trials, Kim kept up his outspoken opposition to the regime. As a member of a delegation from the Norwegian Storting, I visited South Korea in 1979, a visit which among other things brought me into contact with supporters of Kim Dae-jung. I am glad I was able then to serve as a link to important connections in Scandinavia. Even under severe prison conditions, Kim Dae-jung managed to find things to live for. With indomitable optimism, he wrote about the pleasures he found in prison. Reading all kinds of eastern and western books: theology, politics, economics, history and literature. The brief meetings with his family. The letters from those closest to him, and the opportunities to write back, despite all the attempts to prevent him. And finally the flowers in the tiny patch of a garden where he was allowed to spend an hour a day. Kim Dae-jung’s story has a lot in common with the experience of several other Peace Prize Laureates, especially Nelson Mandela and Andrei Sakharov. And with that of Mahatma Gandhi, who did not receive the prize but would have deserved it. To outsiders, Kim’s invincible spirit may appear almost superhuman. On this point, too , the Laureate takes a more sober view: “Many people tell me,” he says, “that I am courageous, because I have been to prison six or seven times and overcome several close calls in my life. However, the truth is that I am as timid now as I was in my boyhood. Considering what I have experienced in my life, I should not be afraid of being imprisoned. But, whenever I was locked up, I was invariably fearful and anxious.” Self-knowledge of this order does not detract from the courage! Kim Dae-jung ran in two more presidential elections, in 1987 and 1992. If no military regime stood in his way, the argument was used against him, in a country of sharp regional divisions, that he came from the wrong region. Finally wearying of the struggle, he withdrew from active politics after the 1992 election. But in 1997 Kim Dae-jung saw a new opportunity. Incredibly enough, with his political enemies divided amongst themselves, the military regime’s leading opponent was elected president. That was the definitive proof that South Korea had at long last found a place among the world’s democracies. The idea of revenge must have occurred to the new president. Instead, as with Nelson Mandela, forgiveness and reconciliation became the main planks in Kim’s political platform and guided the steps he took. Kim Dae-jung forgave most things – including the unforgivable. What had taken place was a democratic revolution. But even after a revolution, some features of the old order live on. In a democratic perspective, South Korea still has some way to go where reform of the legal system and of security legislation is concerned. According to Amnesty International, there are still long-term political prisoners in South Korean gaols. Others maintain that the rights of organized labour are not sufficiently safeguarded. Our reply is that we feel confident that Kim Dae-jung will complete the process of democratisation of which he has been the foremost spokesman for almost half a century. An important debate is currently being conducted in Asia concerning the status of human rights. It is argued by some that such rights are a western invention, a tool for achieving western political and cultural dominance. Kim rejects this view, just as he also denies that there are any special Asian, as distinct from universal, human rights. The same way of thinking led the Nobel Committee, in its grounds for this year’s award, to draw particular attention to the important part Kim has played in the development of human rights throughout East Asia. As José Ramos Horta, Peace Prize Laureate in 1996 and with us here today, has stated, Kim also vigorously took up the cause of East Timor. There was great symbolic force in the decision to place the South Korean army, used only a few years previously to suppress political opposition in its own country, at the disposal of the global community in defence of human rights in East Timor. Kim Dae-jung has also actively supported Aung San Suu Kyi, Peace Prize Laureate in 1991, in her heroic struggle against the dictatorship in Burma . Our thoughts today also reach out to her, prevented as she has so far been from coming to Norway to receive the Peace Prize she so richly deserves. Unfortunately the regime is once again stepping up its pressure on Aung San Suu Kyi. Kim was elected president on a program of extensive reforms in South Korea, and an active policy of cooperation with North Korea now widely spoken of as the “sunshine policy”. The term originated in Aesop’s fable about the traveller who in a strong north wind drew his cloak ever more closely about him, only to have to take it off in the end because of the warmth of the sun. The sunshine policy is designed, if not to stop the wind, then at least to lessen the cold through gradually increasing interaction and an emphasis on the common interests of the two states. Kim Dae-jung has made it clear that South Korea has no intention of annexing or absorbing its northern neighbour. The target is reunification, although both parties know that it will take time and will require the most thorough preparation. There can be little doubt that to date Kim Dae-jung has been the prime mover behind the ongoing process of détente and reconciliation. Perhaps his role can best be compared with Willy Brandt‘s, whose Ostpolitik was of such fundamental importance in the normalisation between the two German states, and won him the Peace Prize. Brandt’s Ostpolitik alone could not have led to German unification, but it was a prerequisite for the union which followed in 1989-90. From South Korea’s point of view, the political side of Germany’s unification looks attractive, while the economic side, with a price tag that may be much higher in Korea than in Germany, is a warning to make haste slowly. The dialogue between Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jung II at the Pyongyang summit last June led to more than loose declarations and airy rhetoric. The pictures of family members meeting after five decades of separation made a deep impression all over the world. However restricted and controlled these contacts may be, the tears of joy are a stark contrast to the cold, hatred and discouragement felt so strongly by all visitors to the border at Panmunjon. The people of North Korea have lived under extremely difficult conditions for a long time. The international community can not be indifferent to their hunger, or remain silent in the face of the country’s massive political repression. On the other hand, North Korea’s leaders deserve recognition for their part in the first steps towards reconciliation between the two countries. In most of the world, the cold war ice age is over. The world may see the sunshine policy thawing the last remnants of the cold war on the Korean peninsula. It may take time. But the process has begun, and no one has contributed more than today’s Laureate, Kim Dae-jung. In the poet’s words, “The first drop was the bravest.”"
"74","2001","United Nations, Kofi Annan","   Translation of the Norwegian text. Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, and, not least, this year’s and past year’s Peace Prize Laureates. Let me begin by extending a warm welcome to this year’s special Peace Prize award ceremony. The Nobel Peace Prize for 2001 is awarded to the United Nations (the UN) and its Secretary-General Kofi Annan for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world. This year we are celebrating the centenary of the Nobel Prizes, including the Peace Prize. That makes it natural to consider historical continuities where both the better organized world and the Nobel Peace Prize are concerned. The idea that mankind has common interests, and that this should find expression in some form or other of shared government or rules, can be traced back to the Roman Empire. In the twentieth century, Woodrow Wilson was a vigorous early spokesman for the belief that we people need each other. Such a belief means that, whether as states or as individuals, we should treat one another in ways that do not make us less able to live together. Tolerance, justice and humanity are essential to the unity of mankind. Alfred Nobel had no self-evident place in this tradition. At one time, he believed that dynamite, his great invention, could do more to prevent war than any peace movement. Nevertheless, the will he made in 1895 was inspired by belief in the community of man. The Peace Prize was to be awarded to the person who had done most for “fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses”. Over the one hundred years that have passed since the first Peace Prize was awarded in 1901, the foremost sustained intention of the Norwegian Nobel Committee has been precisely that: of strengthening international co-operation between states. In the period before World War I, the majority of the Peace Prizes went to representatives of the organized peace movement, either at the parliamentary level through the Inter-Parliamentary Union, or at the more popular level through the International Peace Bureau. But the prizes do not seem to have helped much. The first world war broke out in 1914. In the words of Woodrow Wilson, the first world war was to be “the war to end wars”, and should “make the world safe for democracy”. The new League of Nations was to be the body that resolved conflicts before they led to war. Once again, the Norwegian Nobel Committee sought to promote this greater commitment in international co-operation. In the years between the wars, at least eight Peace Prize Laureates had clear connections with the League of Nations, although the League as such never in fact received the prize. Again the world, and not least Wilson himself, was to be disappointed. The 1919 Peace Prize Laureate was unable to persuade his own United States to join the League of Nations. For would not binding obligations to an international organization also limit American sovereignty? Practically all of us wish to avoid the horrors of war. But we have different notions about how this can come about. All non-pacifists seek other things in addition to peace. There is not necessarily anything wrong with that. Nor can peace be absolute. That was why so many took up arms against Hitler Germany and the Emperor’s Japan. The horrors of World War II made the hopes people pinned on the new world organization, the United Nations, all the greater. The new organization was set even higher targets than the League of Nations. The preamble to the UN Charter thus speaks of “We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind…”. There were many points of organizational similarity between the League of Nations and the UN. But the League of Nations had failed. The answer was to give the Security Council a much more prominent role than the corresponding council had had in the League of Nations. Universal membership would be combined with special rights exercised by the Great Powers. The Security Council could use military force to maintain peace. It was even to have standing armed forces at its disposal, to be established by member states in cooperation. We have not reached that goal even today, fifty-six years on. The UN has achieved many successes, not least in the humanitarian and social fields, where its various special organizations have done such important work. In some respects, the UN achieved more than its founders believed possible. It found itself in the thick of the process of decolonization which in a few short decades swept away centuries-old colonial empires. The UN set important standards, which influenced developments for the majority of people all over the world. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the UN in 1948, became one of the major documents of our time. Article 1 gives clear expression to the hope for a better organized and more peaceful world: “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and human rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood”. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has sought to give these successes the credit they deserve. Since 1945, at least 13 of the Peace Prizes have had links to the UN. Some have gone to UN organizations such as the High Commissioner for Refugees, winner of two awards, UNICEF, the ILO, or the UN’s peace-keeping forces. Others have gone to individuals like Cordell Hull, reputed to have provided the inspiration underlying the UN, John Boyd Orr, the first head of the FAO, Ralph Bunche, first of many UN mediators in the Middle East and, in 1950, the first non-white Peace Prize Laureate, Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN’s second Secretary-General, or René Cassin, main author of the Declaration of Human Rights. In its most important area, however, preventing war and ensuring peace, the UN did not turn out to be all that its supporters had hoped for. In many serious conflicts, the organization remained on the sidelines or was used as a tool by one of the parties. The five Great Powers had all agreed that they had to have a veto. But it is not the veto itself, of course, that explains the UN’s inability to act, but rather the fact that the interests of the two super-powers diverged so radically throughout the many years of cold war. Seeing that the main theme in the history of the Peace Prize has been the wish for a better organized and more peaceful world, it is surprising that the UN as such has not been awarded the Peace Prize before. One reason may be disappointment that the UN did not quite live up to all the expectations of 1945. Another may be the many UN-related prizes, which made it less necessary to give the award to the organization itself. A good deal can be attributed to chance: the UN could have won the award so often that in the end it never did. Until a suitably important occasion arrived. In connection with this year’s centenary, the Committee once again felt a need to emphasise the continuous theme of the history of the Peace Prize, the hope for a better organized and more peaceful world. Nothing symbolises that hope, or represents that reality, better than the United Nations. The end of the cold war meant that the UN became able to play more of the role in security policy for which it was originally intended. The Great Powers still had diverging interests; so, too, of course, had the smaller states, but they had less impact on the international climate. Although the USA provides the clearest illustration, all countries are more or less selective in their attitudes to the UN. They favour an active UN when they need and see opportunities to obtain its support; but when the UN takes a different stance, they seek to limit its influence. Since the cold war, however, greater and smaller powers have to a significant extent been able to unite in meeting the most serious common challenges: to prevent wars and conflicts; to stimulate economic development, especially in poor countries; to strengthen fundamental human rights; to promote a better environment; to fight epidemics; and, in the most recent common endeavour, to prevent international terrorism. No one has done more than Kofi Annan to revitalise the UN. After taking office as the UN’s seventh Secretary-General in January, 1997, he managed in a very short time to give the UN an external prestige and an internal morale the likes of which the organization had hardly seen in its over fifty-year history, with the possible exception of its very first optimistic years. His position within the organization has no doubt benefited from his having devoted almost all his working life to the UN. Experience in a bureaucracy is not always the best springboard for action and fresh approaches to the outside world, but Annan has brought about both. The UN structure has been tightened up and made more efficient. The Secretary-General has figured prominently in the efforts to resolve a whole series of international disputes: the repercussions of the Gulf War, the wars in the former Yugoslavia and especially in Kosovo, the status of East Timor, the war in the Congo, and the implementation of the UN resolutions concerning the Middle East and “land for peace”. On the basis of renewed emphasis on the Declaration of Human Rights, Annan has given the Secretary-General a more active part to play as a protector of those rights. Time and again, he has maintained that sovereignty is not a shield behind which member countries can hide their violations. He has shown the same activist approach to the struggle against HIV/AIDS, a struggle which he has called his “personal priority”. Since the terrorist attack on New York and Washington on the 11th of September, he has urged that the UN must be given a leading part to play in the fight against international terrorism. The Secretary-General’s report on the role of the UN in the 21st century formed the basis for the UN’s Millennium Declaration. Here, too, the agenda is ambitious: to put an end to poverty, to provide better education for the world’s billions of people, to reduce HIV/AIDS, to protect the environment, and to prevent war and armed conflict. The only one of the UN’s previous six Secretaries-General who can be compared to Annan in personal force and historical importance is Dag Hammarskjöld, the organization’s second Secretary-General and the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961. For Kofi Annan, Dag Hammarskjöld has been a model. In his Hammarskjöld Memorial Lecture in September this year, Annan said, “There can be no better rule of thumb for a Secretary-General, as he approaches each new challenge or crisis, than to ask himself, ‘how would Hammarskjöld have handled this?'”. Annan is nevertheless more of a team player than Hammarskjöld was. In other respects, too, Annan goes further than Hammarskjöld could: “I suspect he would envy me the discretion I enjoy in deciding what to say, and what topics to comment on”. This can occasionally be a bit much, however, even for Annan: “I find myself called on to make official statements on almost everything that happens in the world today, from royal marriages to the possibility of human cloning!”. Wars between states have grown quite rare in recent decades. This can be regarded as a victory for norms which the UN has stood for throughout its existence. But many wars are still fought in our time. The new development is that wars within states, civil wars, have become relatively more frequent. This is confronting the UN with major challenges. The UN has traditionally been a defender of the sovereignty of individual states. The principle of state sovereignty is laid down in the UN Charter, especially in Article 2.7. but even that Article contains a qualification: “this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII” (the chapter on action to preserve peace). Now that we are attaching ever-increasing importance to “human security” and not just to the security of states, it makes little difference whether a life is lost in an international or a civil war. If the UN is to prevent civil war, the question soon arises of intervention from outside. Many see intervention as equivalent to invasion. Small states are naturally afraid that big states will use it as a pretext for interfering in their domestic affairs. The policies of colonial powers in Africa and Asia, the Soviet Union’s entries into Eastern Europe, and the USA’s various interventions in the Western hemisphere all illustrate the need to protect the sovereignty of small states. On the other hand, the present situation, with civil wars in numerous countries, is a high price to pay for regarding state sovereignty as absolute. The massacres in Rwanda taught us all, and not least Annan, that the world does not necessarily get any better if one refrains from intervening. As Annan himself has said, we applaud the policeman who “intervenes” to stop a fight, or the teacher who tries to prevent bullying and fighting; and a doctor “intervenes” to save patients’ lives. “A doctor who never intervenes has few admirers and probably even fewer patients.” Where humanitarian concerns are uppermost, Doctors without Borders (MSF) in particular, the 1999 Laureate, has argued that the global community has “a duty to intervene”, a principle which the UN General Assembly has accepted in several important resolutions. The debate on “humanitarian intervention” raises difficult questions to which there are no pat answers, especially when the debate shifts from purely humanitarian to more political ground. Under Annan’s leadership, the UN has shown itself willing to participate in this difficult discussion, with significant results in the last few years. Developments have taken a favourable turn in Kosovo, though there is still a long way to go. The UN played a leading part in the process which in a short space of time advanced East Timor from the status of a colony to, before long, that of an independent state. Maybe the 1996 Peace Prize awarded to Belo and Ramos-Horta also contributed. Today large and small states alike are almost competing in urging the UN to take the lead in developing Afghanistan away from a Taliban regime that has been a leading supporter of international terrorism, and towards a broadly-based government that can lead the country back into the international community. So we have already moved well into the discussion of what steps to take to achieve a better organized and more peaceful world in the next hundred years. It has been repeated again and again that the UN can not become anything more than the world’s ever so multifarious governments wish to make it. But in the light of the many common tasks that lie ahead, we must at least see to it that the very slowest movers among the nations are not allowed to set too much of the future pace. As globalisation expands, the question will be asked even more loudly than at present of who is to manage this development and by what means. In the view of the Nobel Committee, that will be a task for the UN, if not in the form of a centralised world government then at least as the more efficient global instrument which the world so sorely needs. For that to come about, it will help if nations as far as possible have a shared platform. Democracy is stronger today than at any time in history; over half of the world’s population lives under democratic government. This marks a great victory for the principles in the Human Rights Declaration. One need go no further than back to the inter-war years, when democracy was a threatened species of government, to realise how dramatic this progress has been. Democracies rarely if ever go to war with each other. The strong position of democracy today gives grounds for optimism. But much remains to be done, not least in the economic field. We have made very few advances in solidarity between countries that are growing ever richer, and the many countries and individuals who either are not benefiting to the same extent from globalisation or are even suffering from its economic and social consequences. The number of poor people in the world is ever-increasing. There were many reverses in the twentieth century, for the world as a whole and for the idea of a better organized and more peaceful world. Two world wars, and a cold war that lasted more than forty years and spread into every corner of the world, set a limit to how optimistic we can feel about the future. On the other hand, we have witnessed a remarkable development, from the scattered and rather private peace initiatives at the previous turn of the century to the ever stronger and more efficient United Nations we have today. The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes both to honour the work that the UN and its Secretary-General Kofi Annan have already done, and to encourage them to go ahead along the road to a still more forceful and dynamic United Nations."
"75","2002","Jimmy Carter","    Translation of the Norwegian text. Your Majesties, Excellencies, Ladies and   Gentlemen, and – not least – this year’s Laureate, Jimmy   Carter: In one of his volumes, the Norwegian poet   Kolbein Falkeid writes: Do not hang splendid       moments up on the walls       in your thoughts       and gild them       with your longing.       Drive your crowbar       hard under scarred       working days       and force them up.       One by one.       That is why       life has you       on its muster roll.      This year’s Laureate Jimmy Carter is most   decidedly on life’s muster roll. He is one of the most deserving   and least controversial Laureates for a long time. To quote from   the Nobel Committee’s reasons for awarding Carter this year’s   Peace Prize: “The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided   to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2002 to Jimmy Carter, for his   decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to   international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights,   and to promote economic and social development.” That long sentence reflects the fact that   this year’s Laureate has contributed in practically all the areas   that have figured most prominently through the one hundred and   one years of Peace Prize history. He was the politician who   during his presidency attempted to bring about a more peaceful   world. He was, and continues to be, the mediator who seeks   peaceful solutions to international conflicts. He was, and is,   engaged in disarmament and arms control. He has shown, and still   shows, an outstanding commitment to democracy and human rights.   His humanitarian and social activities have been, and are still,   far-reaching. Not all his efforts have been equally   successful. But, as Carter himself has said, and taken as his   motto: “The worst thing that you can do is not to try.” Few   people, if any, have tried harder. This year’s Laureate does the   opposite of what his countryman Mark Twain once wrote about   forgetting where you bury the peace-pipe, but not where the   battle-axe is. Carter never mislays the peace-pipe. The Nobel Committee has not very often   honoured mediators. It is the parties to a conflict that attract   attention. That was the case at Camp David in September 1978. But   a mediator has rarely played a more important part than on   precisely that occasion. Through thirteen days, and as many   nights, Carter showed that a mediator could make a decisive   contribution to the creation of peace between Egypt and Israel.   But Carter had broader aims than peace between those two   countries: he wanted peace in the whole Middle East. He was the   first American President to favour giving the Palestinians their   own “homeland”. He emphasised that the Israelis had to stop   building new settlements on the West Bank. If only the parties   had listened to both pieces of advice! Jimmy Carter should of course have been   awarded the Peace Prize a long time ago. It is no secret today   that the Norwegian Nobel Committee wished to give him the Prize   in 1978, together with Anwar Sadat and Menachim Begin. A mere   formality prevented Carter from receiving his well-earned Peace   Prize at that time: he had not been nominated by the 1 February   deadline. And no member of the Committee nominated him at the   Committee’s first meeting. They could of course not have known in   February what was to happen at Camp David in September. In   September, the Committee wanted to add Carter’s name to the list,   but the statutes of the Nobel Foundation made that   impossible. So Carter seemed to have missed his chance.   The Committee could not go on to award also the following year’s   Peace Prize to the efforts to achieve a peace agreement between   Egypt and Israel. No one could have blamed Carter if he had felt   that this was unfair. Every year since then, there have been   speculations about when Carter would receive the Peace Prize. And   every year he has been obliged to comment on awards given to   others. This he has always done with the same generosity, though   once, in a very mild outburst, he did say: “I’d be delighted, not to mention surprised,   if just once before I die nobody would suggest that what I’m   really trying to do with these years – my hidden agenda – is to   win the Nobel Peace Prize.” It became increasingly obvious that the   by-passing of Carter had been one of the real sins of omission in   Peace Prize history. This year we can finally put all that behind   us. Jimmy Carter only served one term as   President of the United States. In a country where such   importance is attached to outward success, that has cast a   shadow. Carter’s principal concern was to do what he felt was   right, even when it was not the smartest political step to   take. Our historical perspective enables us to see   so much more clearly those features of Carter’s presidency that   were forward-looking. We can see them in the Middle East. We can   see them in Carter’s work for disarmament and arms control. As President, he admittedly launched a   number of controversial weapons programs, but that was only after   he had failed to obtain Soviet agreement to radical disarmament   proposals. Carter was convinced that the weapon stockpiles held   by the superpowers were far too big. His so-called “deep cut”   proposal in 1977 may not have been very realistic, given the   deep-rooted scepticism of Breshnev and the Kremlin towards any   sweeping reductions. But it pointed forward, to the kind of real   disarmament agreements entered into by his successors. Carter   worked hard to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, even when   this created difficulties in relation to close allies. The mediator in Carter had already emerged   when he was Governor of Georgia. He intervened in a number of   heated racial conflicts, to prevent violence and instead find   solutions that both parties could live with. The peace between   Egypt and Israel was the great triumph of his presidency. But he   also righted an old injustice by returning the Panama Canal to   Panama. Since the end of his presidential term,   Carter’s mediation efforts have been innumerable. The most   successful one was probably in Haiti in 1994. In the last few   years, Carter has given increasing emphasis to creating a broader   foundation for mediation through the International Negotiation   Network (INN) – a network which includes several Peace Prize   Laureates. The fight for human rights is probably the   most frequently recurring theme in Carter’s lifework, from his   term as Governor of Georgia, via his presidency, and on to his   many active years as an ex-president. When Carter was elected   President, the position of the United States had been weakened by   its war in Vietnam and the support it had given to various   dictatorships. Carter met the situation by going back to the   heritage from Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt: the USA’s   strongest weapons are the ideals the country has stood for in its   finest hours. Many people regarded Carter’s campaign for   human rights as naive idealism and interference in the internal   affairs of other countries. Today we can see more clearly how   important those efforts were in the Soviet Union and in Eastern   Europe. Of course the issue of human rights was also a weapon in   the power struggle with the Soviet Union. But Carter’s work for   human rights in Latin America and in southern Africa showed how   much more was involved. Carter’s activities as ex-president testify   to the genuineness of his commitment to human rights. Carter and   his staff at the Carter Center in Atlanta, which celebrates its   twentieth anniversary this year, have served as election   observers at three dozen elections in twenty countries. The   Centre has built up routines that have had and are still having a   major influence on such work all over the world. The same can be said of Carter’s election   reports. In 1989 his report that the elections in Panama had not   been lawfully conducted contributed to the withdrawal of all   regional support for President Noriega and ultimately to his   removal. In 1990, Carter persuaded President Ortega to   acknowledge his election defeat in Nicaragua. Few could be better   placed than Carter to explain with conviction that an election   defeat does not necessarily put an end to political activity.   Only a few hours after digesting the news that he had been   awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2002, Carter was off on a new   election assignment – this time to Jamaica. As if mediation, human rights, and   disarmament were not enough, the Carter Center has in cooperation   with other organizations headed a number of important health   campaigns. So far the best results have been achieved in the   fight against guinea worm infection. When the campaign began in   1986, over 3.2 million people in nineteen different Asian and   African countries were afflicted with this parasitic disease.   Today the number of cases has been reduced by over 95 per cent.   Most of the remaining cases are to be found in civil-war-ridden   Sudan. Having overcome smallpox, the world is now on the verge of   exterminating another major epidemic disease. The Carter Center also reports considerable   progress in the fight against river blindness in Africa and Latin   America. More than 15 million vaccinations have been carried out.   The aim is to eliminate the disease on both continents by   2007. A third program is more geared to   development. Through Global 2000, the Carter Center is   seeking to improve living conditions in a score of poor African   countries. It uses a wide range of instruments, from   reforestation and health initiatives to the introduction of new   varieties of grain. In the latter field, the Center has joined   forces with another Peace Prize Laureate, Norman Borlaug.   Although there appears to be a long way to go, there is hope that   the “green revolution” will produce the same good results in   Africa as in Asia and Latin America. One of the basic principles of the Carter   Center is that “people can improve their lives when provided with   the necessary skills, knowledge, and access to resources”. This   applies not only at the international level, but also in the   highest degree also at home in the United States. Every year we   see pictures of Jimmy and Rosalynn in a slum somewhere or other,   busy building housing for and together with the poor. While there   must have been good opportunities for an ex-president to make   money for himself, Carter has instead through Habitat for   Humanity and the Atlanta Project wielded hammer and saw for the   benefit of others. As the Norwegian poet Arnulf Øverland   says in his poem “Domestic Decalogue”, “to make someone else   happy is the only happiness”. Rosalynn is always at Jimmy’s side. It is   hard to recall any other American presidential couple who have   stood together to the same extent in practically every   connection. This is how Carter himself put it, as long ago as in   1975, in the book Why Not the Best?: “When WE   (emphasised here) decided to enter politics, Rosalynn helped me   from every standpoint. We have been full partners in every major   decision since we first married.” Jimmy Carter has always preferred to look   ahead. Not that he need be ashamed to look back. There is much in   his four years in the White House that he can remember with   pride. But he is always setting himself new targets. He has been   the despair of historians, also at the Nobel Institute, who have   tried to get him to talk about his presidency. He would rather   move on; there is so much to do. Jimmy Carter sees this as his   duty as a Christian. Even when he was President, he held Sunday   school classes – and he still does. His deep faith goes hand in   hand with an exceptional degree of religious tolerance. Carter’s work on so many fronts has been   marked by the finest form of Christian optimism. He has often   told his Sunday school in Plains that “We’ll never know whether   something new and wonderful is possible unless we try. Let’s   scratch our heads, stretch our minds, be adventurous! Serve God   with boldness, and who knows what wonders the Lord may work?” In the last paragraph of the reasons it gave   for awarding this year’s Peace Prize to Jimmy Carter, the   Norwegian Nobel Committee mentioned “a situation marked by   threats of the use of power”, and emphasised that “conflicts must   as far as possible be resolved through negotiation and   international co-operation based on international law, respect   for human rights, and economic development.” These are principles   which Carter has stood for, ever more firmly. These are the   principles which the Norwegian Nobel Committee hopes that the   international community will take as its guidelines in the   difficult conflicts the world is facing today and will face in   the years to come. Most of us become more conservative as we   grow older. With Jimmy Carter the opposite seems to be the case.   In this respect he is an atypical pensioner, growing with the   years more and more radical and critical of society. His   criticism of those in power in his own country and abroad has   grown sharper. One does not have to agree with everything he says   in order to admire his involvement. Jimmy Carter has evidently taken the advice   of his favourite poet, Dylan Thomas: Do not go gentle into that good night,       Old age should burn and rave at the close of day.      Jimmy Carter will probably not go down in   American history as the most effective President. But he is   certainly the best ex-president the country ever had. And, most   importantly for us: he is a most worthy recipient of the Nobel   Peace Prize. Jimmy Carter stands out very clearly on the   muster roll of life!"
"76","2003","Shirin Ebadi","    Translation of the Norwegian text. Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Peace   Prize Laureate, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, “The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel   Peace Prize for 2003 to Shirin Ebadi for her efforts for   democracy and human rights. She has focused especially on the   campaign for the rights of women and children.” This was the   first sentence of the Committee’s announcement on 10 October of   this year’s Peace Prize Laureate. I believe this announcement has   already changed your life, Shirin Ebadi. Your name will shine in   the history of the Peace Prize. Let us hope that the prize will   also inspire changes in your beloved home country, Iran, as well   as in many other parts of the world where people need to hear   your clear voice. And let me hasten to add – this applies   to the western world as well. Fundamental values, such as   liberty, justice and respect for human rights will – in all   places and at all times – need vigilant and critical   champions. The great Persian poet, Rumi or Mowlavi as   Iranians like to call him, lived in the 13th century. Somewhere   in his great work “Mathnawi”, there is a short poem about a   miserable wretch who came under attack by a ferocious dragon. A   heroic rescuer rushed in at the last moment, and Rumi’s comment   is: “There are such helpers in the world, who   rush to save   anyone who cries out. Like Mercy itself,   they run towards the screaming. And they can’t be bought off.   If you were to ask one of those, “Why did you come   so quickly?” he or she would say, “Because I heard   your helplessness.” Another of the great Persian poets, Saadi   of Shiraz, who also lived in the 13th century, says in the   well-known work “The Rose Garden” – Golistan – that   he who is indifferent to the suffering of others is a traitor to   that which is truly human. Dear Shirin Ebadi, You and the Iranian people represent the   tradition of Saadi and Rumi. You are both guide and   bridge-builder. You strive to bring people together across   cultures, races and religions! That is your hallmark! The Norwegian poet, Arne Paasche Aasen,   wrote in 1939 the lovely poem “Your youth” – about being   young in spirit – where he says: “Now cries the world: We need your   heart,   your gifts, your flaming spirit!   And were you to be given youth to have and keep   Then use it – use all your energy and powers” Dear Shirin Ebadi, You are young in spirit. You possess great   gifts. You have a warm heart. You are brave. We admire your   efforts. The world needs you! Congratulations with the 2003 Nobel Peace   Prize! The Norwegian Nobel Committee is convinced that the Peace   Prize has been awarded to the right person, at the right time and   in the right place. When the director of the Nobel Institute   telephoned Shirin Ebadi’s home in Teheran to tell her the good   news, her husband answered that his wife was in Paris and would   not be easy to get hold of – she had forgotten her mobile   telephone at home. Nevertheless, the news that you had been   awarded the Nobel Peace Prize reached you very quickly in Paris,   and the entire conference broke out in enthusiastic jubilation.   Later, we learned that you were not even aware that you had been   nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. But then, reactions started pouring in. Not   everyone knew your name, but the world understood immediately   what the Committee meant: All people are entitled to fundamental   rights, and at a time when Islam is being demonized in many   quarters of the western world, it was the Norwegian Nobel   Committee’s wish to underline how important and how valuable it   is to foster dialogue between peoples and between civilizations.   This is a wish that most people share and that is why the   reactions to this year’s award have been so positive, even though   we understand if you had perhaps hoped for a few more   congratulations from the authorities of your own home country and   region. And now, of course, you have suddenly become quite a   world celebrity! Today you are here, Shirin Ebadi, in Oslo   City Hall to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for 2003. And we   rejoice together with you, your closest family and friends, many   of whom are present here today. It is indeed a great pleasure for the   Norwegian Nobel Committee to award – for the first time in   history – the Nobel Peace Prize to a woman from the Muslim   world – a woman that the world can be proud of, as can all other   champions of human rights around the world. It is our sincere hope that the people of   Iran will feel joy that a citizen of their country – for   the first time in history – receives the Nobel Peace Prize.   And we hope that the prize will serve as inspiration for all   those who are campaigning for human rights and democracy in your   country, in the Muslim world and in all countries in the East and   West – everywhere where human rights work needs inspiration   and support. Shirin Ebadi has been awarded the Nobel   Peace Prize for her efforts for democracy and human rights and,   in particular, for her fight for the rights of women and   children. She has been very clear in her opposition to   patriarchal cultures that deny equal rights to women, who   represent half of the population. But mothers must also be aware   of their responsibilities. They are the ones who bring up young   boys to be men and who raise daughters to become strong women.   Shirin Ebadi is the founder and leader of the Association for   Support of Children’s Rights in Iran, which has some 5000   members. The centre is located in Teheran and it produces   information material for use in schools and operates an emergency   hot line for children. The Nobel Committee hopes that the Nobel   Peace Prize award to Shirin Ebadi will contribute to an increased   focus on the rights of children the world over. In an interview Shirin Ebadi was asked: “Do   you have a message to send to Muslim women?” “Yes”, she answered,   “Keep on fighting”. “Don’t believe that you are meant to occupy a   lower position in society. Get yourself an education! Do your   best and compete in all areas of life. God created us all as   equals. By fighting for equal status, we are doing what God wants   us to do”, argues Shirin Ebadi. In this respect, it is worth   noting that some 60 percent of the students at the University of   Teheran are, in fact, women. At the same time, we must not forget   women’s legitimate claim for equality before the law. In law and   order, we must all be equal, and women must enjoy exactly the   same rights as men. On this issue, Shirin Ebadi stands in the   front ranks and we can but admire her for her efforts. Many are those who have drawn benefit from   Shirin Ebadi’s commitment and capacity for work. She has pleaded   the cause of refugees in a region where they are in such great   numbers and so desperately need help. Furthermore, she has called   attention to the rights of all citizens – also their right   to freedom of expression – irrespective of religion, ethnic   origin or political opinion. As a lawyer, judge, lecturer, author and   activist, her voice has sounded clearly and powerfully in her   native country Iran, and also far beyond its national borders.   She has come forward with professional force and unflagging   courage, and she has defied any danger to her own safety. She is   truly a woman of the people! The campaign for fundamental human rights   is her most important arena and no society can be called   civilized if the rights of women and children fail to be   respected. At a time of violence, she has staunchly upheld the   principle of non-violence. For her, it is fundamental that the   supreme political power of a society is founded on democratic   elections. She emphasizes that information and dialogue   constitute the best avenue toward a change of attitudes and a   settling of conflicts. After years of reflection, she has come to   the conclusion that revolution never leads to the changes   promised by the revolutionaries. The road forward must move in   the direction of non-violence and dialogue, law and order. Again and again, this year’s Laureate has   stressed that she is an Iranian. “I am proud to be an Iranian. I   shall live in Iran for as long as I possibly can,” she says. For   Shirin Ebadi, this has meant a life in fear, but she has learned   to live with her fear and she is optimistic about the future.   People insist on ruling themselves. The time when ruling powers   could threaten their way to dominion is gone forever. Rulers   “will realize that the time for governing through fear is drawing   to a close the world over. Why should Iran be an exception?” she   says. The 110 persons and organizations that have   been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize over the years are extremely   diverse. But the majority of them have one thing in common   – they are optimists, unshakable optimists. It is their   optimism that gives them the inspiration they need in their   struggles. Furthermore, many of the laureates are filled with a   courage that we can scarcely understand. Even under the most   challenging of circumstances, they keep going – day after   day, year after year. Shirin Ebadi has run great risks. As a   lawyer, she brings cases to court that few others would venture   to get involved in. Her ideas are spreading in ever-widening   circles, and, to quote the Norwegian poet Paasche Aasen: You must   be true to your own youth, “so that the field you plough can grow   when your work is done.” There are several long lines running   through the 102 years of Nobel Peace Prize history. In the last   few decades, the most distinct of these has perhaps been the   increasing emphasis that the Norwegian Nobel Committee has placed   on democracy and human rights. Who was the first to receive the   Peace Prize according to this tradition is open for debate. Was   it the prize awarded to Woodrow Wilson in 1919 or   to Carl von   Ossietzky in 1935, or even the 1951 prize to the French union   leader, Léon   Jouhaux? Although human rights represent one dimension of all   these three awards, there were also other dimensions involved.   Hence, the first indisputable human rights prize was perhaps,   after all, the one awarded to Albert Lutuli of South   Africa in 1960. In the more than four decades since, many   such prizes have followed. Some names shine brighter than others:   Martin Luther King   (1964), Andrei   Sakharov (1975), Amnesty International   (1977), Lech   Walesa (1983), Desmond Tutu (1984),   Aung San Suu Kyi   (1991) – and she is especially in our thoughts today   – Rigoberta   Menchú (1992) and Nelson Mandela (1993) and   then this year, Shirin Ebadi. It is against this backdrop that we   can more easily understand what this year’s Laureate has achieved   and what the consequences of such a prize can be, when it works   at its best. The idea of human rights and democracy is   gaining ground – albeit slowly. Practising human rights is always   a challenge; high demands will always be placed on those who wish   to live up to their ideals. It is with great satisfaction that we   see that the idea of people’s right to govern themselves through   free elections is gradually prevailing in many parts of the   world. By comparison to only 10-15 years ago, all of eastern   Europe, Russia and several other countries of the former Soviet   Union, many states in eastern Asia and not least in Latin   America, as well as a few in Africa have now adopted democratic   forms of government. Perhaps the Norwegian Nobel Committee is   able to stimulate a development that still has mainly local roots   and explanations. Every nation must fight its own battle. But we   who stand on the outside looking in can express our sympathy and   make our contribution. Shirin Ebadi is a conscious Muslim. She   sees no conflict between Islam and fundamental human rights.   Islam is a diverse religion. How the message of justice is to be   realized in practice and how human integrity is to be preserved   is an essential issue for Muslims of today. We shall listen to   all positive, novel interpretations, all proposals of reform.   Here too, women have an important role to play; no longer is it   for elderly men to interpret the message, argue many Muslim   women. “Those who kill in the name of Islam, they violate Islam”,   says Shirin Ebadi. We know that human rights are being violated   not only in Muslim countries. It happens whether regimes our   religious or secular, nationalistic or Marxist. For Shirin Ebadi, therefore, it is not religion that is the   deepest root cause of the problem. But, no matter what, state and   religion should be separate, is her view, since the political   arena should be open to so many diverse interests and views.   Shirin Ebadi underlines that the dialogue between different   cultures in the world must be founded on the values they have in   common. There need be no fundamental conflict between Islam and   Christianity. That is why she was pleased that the Pope was among   the first to congratulate her on the Peace Prize. It is possible that the Peace Prize may, in   the short-term, have led to more hostilities than peace in the   homeland of some Peace Prize laureates. But the Nobel Committee’s   acknowledgement of democracy and human rights rests on the belief   that repression cannot persist in the long run. In the last few   decades in particular, we have seen how large parts of the world   have abruptly thrown off the yoke of dictatorship. Repression   leads to conflict. Most people will simply not put up with the   “peace of the graveyard”, and one of the most certain findings of   modern political science is precisely that democracies do not go   to war against each other. I appeal to all individuals, all peoples   and to all nations of the world: Let us work together for a better world.   Let build peace and prevent war.   Let us make the world a better place to live in for young and for   old.   Let us focus on human integrity and human rights.   Let us fight against poverty and disease in the world.   Let justice, respect and cooperation prevail among peoples and   nations of the world.   Let us TOGETHER realize the dream of world peace. As the university man that I am, I challenge   all universities the world over to be even more distinct in   underscoring the world’s need for peace, democracy and social and   economic justice. Dear Peace Prize Laureate Shirin Ebadi, We admire your efforts for human rights in   general and your struggle for the rights of women and children in   particular.   We admire your work for peace without resorting to   violence.   We admire your work for dialogue between religions of the   world. We hope that the Nobel Peace Prize may contribute to the   realization of your dream. Allow me finally to revert to the great   poet Rumi who wanted to expose everything that prevents us from   seeing the world as it is – and who also tells us that the   vision or dream leads to clear-sightedness. In a poem, whose   Norwegian title is “Draumen som må tolkast” – The   dream that must be interpreted, Rumi says: “and although we seem to sleep, there is an   inner vigilant voice that steers the dream, that will finally   awake us to the truth about who we are.” The great Norwegian poet Olav H. Hauge also   had a dream. He has written the beautiful poem “It’s the Dream”,   that I would like to conclude with: “It’s the dream we carry in secret   that something miraculous will happen   that must happen   that time will open   that the heart will open   that doors will open   that mountains will open   that springs will gush –   that the dream will open   that one morning we will glide into   some harbour we didn’t know was there.” Congratulations, Shirin Ebadi, and all the   best of luck in your future endeavours!"
"77","2004","Wangari Maathai"," English Norwegian Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Peace Prize Laureate, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, “The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2004 to Wangari Maathai for her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace. Peace on earth depends on our ability to secure our living environment. Maathai stands at the front of the fight to promote ecologically viable social, economic and cultural development in Kenya and in Africa. She has taken a holistic approach to sustainable development that embraces democracy, human rights and women’s rights in particular. She thinks globally and acts locally.” These are the opening sentences of the Committee’s statement of its reasons for this year’s Peace Prize award on the 8th of October. “My God, my God”, Wangari Maathai exclaimed, when the Director of the Nobel Institute called her on a poor mobile phone connection to tell her that she had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2004. She bubbled over with joy, and the news was all over the world in an instant – a good twenty minutes before the official announcement in Oslo! Maathai was visiting the little village of Ihururu, 95 kilometres north of Nairobi, distributing food from the government. Her Kenyan listeners – mostly women – clapped politely when she told them that she had been awarded the Peace Prize. But they laughed out loud when she told them that she had been given so much money that she couldn’t even count it. Today, Wangari Maathai, you are here in the Oslo Town Hall to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for 2004. We share your joy with you and with your closest relatives and friends who are gathered here. We are also pleased to see so many Kenyans and other Africans in the Town Hall. We have all come together here to pay you our tribute. Dear mama Wangari Maathai,
You have shown what it means to be a true African mother and a true African woman. Kenya admires you! Africa admires you! The world admires you! May your unceasing fight for the right always remain a source of inspiration for mankind. I think the announcement has already changed your life. Your name will figure prominently in the history of the Peace Prize, together with the other African Peace Prize Laureates: Albert Lutuli, Anwar Sadat, Desmond Tutu, Nelson Mandela, Fredrik Willem de Klerk and Kofi Annan. We hope the Peace Prize may be an inspiration for positive change in your beloved Kenya, in Africa, and in the many countries in the world that need to hear your voice. Congratulations on the Nobel Peace Prize for 2004. Wangari Maathai was born in 1940 in the provincial capital Nyeri, north of Nairobi and within sight of mighty Mount Kenya. Most unusually for African girls from the provinces, she received higher education in Kenya. On completing her Kenyan education, she went to the United States, where she took a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree. In 1971 she became the first woman in Kenya to take a doctorate, subsequently becoming the first female professor at the University of Nairobi. As a biologist, she saw the problems that deforestation and soil erosion were causing in rural areas, especially for the women who do most of the physical work. Grazing areas for livestock were being destroyed. The women were having to go further and further in search of wood for cooking. In 1977 Maathai took an important decision. She resigned from her chair, and on the 5th of June, World Environment Day, she planted nine trees in her backyard and founded the Green Belt Movement. Its aim was to restore Africa’s forests and put an end to the poverty that deforestation was causing. In the 1980s, Maathai became the Chairperson of the National Council of Women, and her successes with tree-planting and political campaigning for women brought her into conflict with the authorities. She thus also became one of the leaders of the pro-democracy movement. When the government wanted to build a 62-storey skyscraper in Uhuru Park, the only park in the centre of Nairobi, Maathai organized the protests thanks to which the building plans were abandoned. The struggles for the environment, for democracy and for women’s rights all came together to form a whole. In due course many men also joined her movement. Maathai’s many initiatives exposed her to harassment. She was repeatedly sent to prison; she was attacked with tear gas and clubbed. The government met with little success in its efforts to curb this awkward woman. Maathai became internationally known, and won numerous prizes for her work. She was elected to Parliament in 2002, the year when Daniel arap Moi finally had to relinquish power, after subjecting the country to increasingly authoritarian rule ever since 1978. In 2003, in the broad coalition government that took over, Maathai was appointed Deputy Minister of Environment, Natural Resources and Wildlife. You are the first woman from Africa to be honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize. You will also be the first African from the vast region between South Africa and Egypt to receive the prize. You stand as an example and a source of inspiration to everyone in Africa who is fighting for sustainable development, democracy and peace. You are an outstanding role model for all women in Africa and the rest of the world. You bravely opposed the oppressive regime in Kenya. Your unique modes of action put the spotlight on political oppression both nationally and internationally. You combine science, commitment, active politics, and faith in God. Beyond simply preserving the existing environment, your strategy is to safeguard and strengthen the foundations for sustainable development. Your goal is to protect God’s creation “so that this earth can become the Garden of Eden that God created”. From 1950 to 2000, Kenya lost 90 per cent of its forests. You founded the Green Belt Movement, in which over a period of nearly thirty years you have mobilised poor women to plant thirty million trees. Your methods have also been adopted in other countries. We are all witnesses to how deforestation and forest loss have led to desertification in Africa and threatened many other regions of the world – also in Europe. Protecting forests to stop desertification is a major step towards strengthening our common global environment. Through education, family planning, nutrition, and the fight against corruption, the Green Belt Movement is creating conditions for development at grass-root level. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has for a long time maintained that there are many different paths to peace. The Committee’s peace concept is in other words a broad one. This explains why many different categories of persons and organizations have received the Nobel Peace Prize. Statesmen and politicians can contribute at the international, the regional and the national level, and many have been awarded the prize. Major humanitarian organizations, and individuals engaged in humanitarian work, have also been recognized. Humanitarian work must in the highest degree be seen as promoting the “fraternity between nations” of which Alfred Nobel speaks in his will. The many awards to those who have worked for disarmament or arms control relate directly to the “abolition or reduction of standing armies” that Nobel also mentions. In recent decades, the Nobel Committee has made human rights a central element of the definition of peace. There were many warnings against such a broadening of the concept of peace. Today there are few things peace researchers and other scholars are readier to agree on than precisely that democracy and human rights advance peace. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has believed so for over forty years, if not indeed much longer. This year, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has evidently broadened its definition of peace still further. Environmental protection has become yet another path to peace. Let me be quick to add that Wangari Maathai has been a leading spokeswoman for democracy and human rights, and especially women’s rights, both under Daniel arap Moi and in today’s Kenya. In this connection she stands firmly on the same ground as many earlier Laureates. What is so impressive about Maathai’s work is its comprehensiveness. But it was the Committee’s own decision to emphasise its environmental dimension. So what in fact is the relationship between the environment and peace? Most people would probably agree that there are connections between peace on the one hand and an environment on the other in which scarce resources such as oil, water, minerals or timber are quarrelled over. The Middle East is full of disputes relating to oil and water. Clearly, not everyone outside the region has appreciated the importance to Arab-Israeli relations of the conflicts over the waters of the Jordan, Litani, Orontes and other rivers. Competition for minerals has been an important element of several conflicts in Africa in recent years. Competition for timber has figured prominently in Liberia, in Indonesia and in Brazil. Present-day wars and conflicts take place not so much between as within states. But where does tree-planting come in? When we analyse local conflicts, we tend to focus on their ethnic and religious aspects. But it is often the underlying ecological circumstances that bring the more readily visible factors to the flashpoint. Consider the conflict in Darfur in the Sudan. What catches the eye is that this is a conflict between Arabs and Africans, between the government, various armed militia groups, and civilians. Below this surface, however, lies the desertification that has taken place in the last few decades, especially in northern Darfur. The desert has spread southwards, forcing Arab nomads further and further south year by year, bringing them into conflict with African farmers. In the Philippines, uncontrolled deforestation has helped to provoke a rising against the authorities. In Mexico, soil erosion and deforestation have been factors in the revolt in Chiapas against the central government. In Haiti, in Amazonas, and in the Himalayas, deforestation and the resulting soil erosion have contributed to deteriorating living conditions and caused tension between population groups and countries. In many countries deforestation, often together with other problems, leads to migration to the big cities, where the lack of infrastructure is another source of further conflict. Can all this not be said more simply? Maathai herself has put it like this: “We are sharing our resources in a very inequitable way. We have parts of the world that are very deprived and parts of the world that are very rich. And that is partly the reason why we have conflicts.” Wars and conflicts certainly have many other causes, too. But who would deny that inequitable distribution, locally and internationally, is relevant in this connection? I predict that within a few decades, when researchers have developed more comprehensive analyses of many of the world’s conflicts, the relation between the environment, resources and conflict may seem almost as obvious as the connection we see today between human rights, democracy and peace. Another thing that needs to be said in this context is that sooner or later, in order to meet environmental problems, there will have to be international cooperation across all national boundaries on a much larger scale than we have seen up to now. We live on the same globe. We must all cooperate to meet the world’s environmental challenges. Together we are strong, divided we are weak. Not long ago I was invited to the village school where I come from to tell the pupils about Peace Prize Laureate Maathai. Afterwards the pupils planted a tree in the school garden – a peace tree. There was ceremony in the schoolyard. Let me challenge schools in Africa, in Norway and in the rest of the world to plant a tree – a peace tree – in their school gardens. That is how concrete the peace concept can be. Children can understand it! The Norwegian poet Halldis Moren Vesaas has put it so beautifully in her poem “The woman is planting”: The woman is planting a tree in the world.
On her knees, like someone in prayer,
Among the remains of the many trees
That the storm has broken down.
She must try again, perhaps one at last
Will be left to grow in peace. And this is how Moren Vesaas ends the poem: She sees the hands outspread on the earth
As if trying to impose her calm
On its threatening tremors. Oh earth, be still,
Be still, so my tree can grow. In its award to you, Wangari Maathai, of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2004, the Nobel Committee wishes to pay a special tribute to and express special support for the women of Africa and in the rest of the world. Africa’s women have at all times been of the greatest importance to the development of the continent. They have borne the heaviest burdens. The woman has worked the land. Right up to the present, she has done about 80 per cent of the work of food production. Once the man has cleared the land, the rest is the woman’s work. She has gone out into the fields at dawn, she has hoed, she has sowed, she has watered, she has weeded, she has harvested. From the harvest she prepares the food for her family. She has also done much of the work with the livestock. She has walked and walked, in erect dignity – with a child on her back and a load on her head. Millions of women still walk and walk to find fuel for their cooking pots and water for their housekeeping. Going to market is also the women’s province in Africa. As they are responsible for the food for their families, women organize their work so that they can exchange what they produce and need at the market. Women bear an average of six children each, a heavy strain under the prevailing living conditions, with no men in one third of all households. Women have moreover been particularly hard hit by Africa’s HIV/AIDS epidemic. No doubt Wangari Maathai will in the years ahead be at the forefront of Africa’s fight against HIV/AIDS. Neither states nor families in Africa have given priority to providing equal educational opportunities for girls and boys, for women and men. Where college and university education is concerned, fewer than 10 per cent of the age group are students, compared to over half in many Western countries. Only one quarter of the students taking higher education in Africa are women. More extensive education for women offers a vast potential for improving African living conditions. Wangari Maathai has shown us what rich fruit education can bear. Africa’s women have borne heavy burdens. But then Africa has also brought forth strong women. One of the strongest stands before us here today. Sometimes we all feel that the challenges confronting us are simply too great. That is when we need optimism. It is easier to be optimistic if we take the long view. Few people have put this better than Mahatma Gandhi: “When I despair, I remember that all through history, the way of truth and love has always won. There have been murderers and tyrants, and for a time they seem invincible. But in the end they always fall. Think of it, always.” Today, in celebrating Wangari Maathai as Nobel Peace Prize Laureate for 2004, I have made my own little poem, inspired by a speech by Prime Minister Tony Blair: Let us make Africa a better place to live.
Let us make Africa a better place to grow children.
Let us make Africa a better place to get old.
Let us make Africa a better place to lead a full life.
Let us make Africa the millennium continent.
Let us make peace with justice in the whole world. CONGRATULATIONS! TWAKUPONGEZA, TUNASEMA ASANTE SANA

"78","2005","International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei"," Your Majesties, Your Royal Highness, Nobel Peace Prize     Laureates, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel     Peace Prize for 2005 is to be shared, in two equal parts, between the International     Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its Director General, Mohamed ElBaradei,     for their efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used for military     purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is used     in the safest possible way. At a time when the threat of nuclear arms is again increasing,     the Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to underline that this threat must be     met through the broadest possible international cooperation. This principle     finds its clearest expression today in the work of the IAEA and its Director     General. In the nuclear non-proliferation regime, it is the IAEA which controls     that nuclear energy is not misused for military purposes, and the Director     General has stood out as a bold advocate of new measures to strengthen that     regime. At a time when disarmament efforts appear deadlocked, when there     is a danger that nuclear arms will spread both to states and to terrorist     groups, and when nuclear power again appears to be playing an increasingly     significant role, this work is of incalculable importance. The vision underlying the IAEA stems from President Dwight     D. Eisenhower. In December 1953, he gave his famous “Atoms for Peace” speech     at the United     Nations. The vision was surprisingly concrete: the nuclear     powers should “make joint contributions from their stockpiles of normal     uranium and fissionable materials to an International Atomic Energy Agency”.     The most important task for the IAEA would be “to devise methods whereby     this fissionable material would be allocated to serve the peaceful pursuits     of mankind”. The IAEA was in other words to receive potentially military     nuclear material from the nuclear powers, and then distribute it for peaceful     use to the countries that were most in need of it. The IAEA was formally     established on 29 July 1957, for the purpose of preventing military use and     stimulating peaceful use of nuclear energy. Implicitly in the IAEA statutes, but all the more explicitly     in the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1970, which was to mean so much     to the IAEA, the five original nuclear powers are under an obligation “to     reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goals of eliminating those     weapons”. This important point has been repeated on a number of subsequent     occasions. Despite several arms limitation agreements, the traditional nuclear     powers can by no means be said to have come much closer to this goal. Although     the number of nuclear weapons deployed has been reduced, tens of thousands     of them remain – about as many as when the NPT entered into force – as     well as a continuing interest in the development of new weapon types. This     is one main reason why further non-proliferation efforts have stalled. The     nuclear powers must take their obligations under the NPT seriously. It is     hypocritical to go on developing one’s own nuclear weapons while doing     everything in one’s power to prevent others from acquiring such weapons.     As ElBaradei himself has put it, it is like “some who have … continued     to dangle a cigarette from their mouth and tell everybody else not to smoke”. The number of nuclear powers in the world has risen.     In addition to the USA, Russia, Great Britain, France and China, Israel,     India and Pakistan have nuclear arms. Perhaps North Korea, too. This is not     to say that there have been no positive developments. South Africa discontinued     its program, thus becoming the first country to have developed nuclear weapons     only to abandon them. All credit to South Africa! Belorussia, Ukraine and     Kazakhstan renounced the nuclear weapons which the Soviet Union had left     behind in their territories. Libya has reversed its policy. Argentina, Brazil,     Taiwan, South Korea and Turkey have given up ambitious programs. Nevertheless,     proliferation continues. It has to be stopped. The IAEA has met with both successes and reverses in     its struggle to prevent the spread of nuclear arms. Iraq illustrates both.     Initially, the IAEA failed to uncover the extensive program which Saddam     Hussein had developed in the 1980s. That necessitated new routines. On the     other hand, in cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission on     Iraq (UNSCOM) and the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection     Commission (UNMOVIC), the IAEA then managed in the 1990s to destroy such     weapons of mass destruction as did exist. In the period prior to the invasion     of Iraq in 2003, the IAEA and UNMOVIC were under heavy pressure, despite     which the inspectors carried out their task in Iraq in an independent, thorough     and correct manner. As the world could see after the war in Iraq, the weapons     that were not found proved not to have existed. In North Korea, the IAEA discovered that the North Koreans     had lied about their nuclear program. Since then, however, it has not been     given any opportunity to carry out the inspections in North Korea which are     certainly necessary. With respect to Iran, too, the IAEA has had both ups     and downs. Iran managed to keep its nuclear program concealed for 18 years.     For the past two years, however, the IAEA has undertaken important work there     with some degree of success. The tense situation in the country can only     be resolved provided the IAEA is allowed to carry out the necessary inspections     and its steps and resolutions are respected. Keeping pace with the many challenges with which it has     been confronted in the last few years, the IAEA has managed to tighten up     the control it exercises, also by carrying out special inspections at short     notice. It has done a good job in a number of difficult contexts. At a time     when international organizations have been heavily criticised, the IAEA has     not only maintained but even in many respects strengthened its position.     Its security control enables the organization to exercise functions that     were previously the preserve of national authorities. In so far as it has     encroached on national sovereignty, this control has broken new ground. Complete     sovereignty in the nuclear field means complete insecurity for the rest of     the world. The central figure in this strengthening of the IAEA     has been Director General ElBaradei. He has himself put forward numerous     proposals aimed at this objective. He is an active participant in debates     on the future of the non-proliferation regime. While building on the important     work of his predecessors, and of Hans Blix in particular, he has managed     to strengthen still further the positions both of the Director General and     of the IAEA. His recent re-election for a third term will open up new opportunities     in the years ahead both for him and for the IAEA. Today’s award is     thus very much a tribute to Mohamet ElBaradei in person, but is also intended     to recognise the 2,300 staff from 90 countries who currently work for the     IAEA, as well as the many who worked there before. Many are here today. We     salute you and thank you for your work. For the IAEA it has been and still is very important     to help the poor countries of the world to participate in the use of nuclear     energy for peaceful purposes. Refraining from military uses should make it     possible to help such countries with civilian uses. Such peaceful use has     been controversial in many countries, however, and there has consequently     been no increase in recent years. Nuclear energy currently accounts for about     16 per cent of global electricity production, but nearly all of this is in     highly developed countries. Growth today is taking place principally in Russia,     China, India and Brazil. The main reasons for the growth are energy shortages,     high oil prices, the need to reduce CO2 emissions, and enhanced operational     safety. Although opinions differ on the civilian use of nuclear     energy, we should all be able to agree on the importance of ensuring that     the use that does take place is made as safe as possible. If we do see further     growth in this sector, control arrangements will become all the more essential.     This forms a major part of the work of the IAEA. Incidentally, many of us     may not pause to reflect on the prominent position of nuclear energy in the     health services, especially in the treatment of cancer, as well as in connection     with agriculture, the environment, and industry. The award to the IAEA and to ElBaradei is firmly founded     in the history of the Peace Prize, and in Alfred Nobel’s will, in which     he mentions the “abolition or reduction of standing armies” as     one of the three criteria for the award. Nobel would surely have agreed that     in our day the struggle against nuclear arms must be even more urgent than     opposition to “standing armies”. This year’s prize to the IAEA and ElBaradei links     together the two principal major lines of thought that have governed selections     for the award throughout its history. Again and again, the Norwegian Nobel     Committee has stressed the need for a better organized world. This explains     the many prizes to representatives of the Inter-Parliamentary Union before     World War I, to representatives of the League of Nations in the inter-war     years, and to individuals and organizations attached to the United Nations     after World War II. In 2001, year of the centenary of the Nobel Prizes, it     was therefore only natural to give the award to the United Nations and to     its Secretary General Kofi Annan. This year it is 60 years since the foundation     of the United Nations. The IAEA is very much a part of the UN system and     consequently belongs under this most distinct of all headings in the history     of the Peace Prize. A second and almost equally prominent theme has been     work for disarmament and arms control. Many Laureates have advocated disarmament     and peace in general. Even in the nuclear field a number of prizes have been     awarded: to Linus Pauling in 1962 for his work for a nuclear test ban agreement;     to Andrei Sakharov in 1975 for campaigning for nuclear disarmament and democracy;     to Alva Myrdal and Garcia     Robles in 1982 for seeking non-proliferation; to     International Physicians for the     Prevention of Nuclear War in 1985, working     across the east-west divide; and to the Pugwash     Conferences and  Joseph Rotblat in 1995 for the important work they did for nuclear disarmament, especially     at the expert level. It has been claimed that every tenth year the Norwegian     Nobel Committee awards the prize to someone seeking the abolition of nuclear     weapons. With the awards of 1975, 1985 and 1995 in mind, it is difficult     for the Committee to deny the charge. But such awards have, as you have heard,     been made more frequently than once a decade. And it was not the case in     2005 that the Committee had zeroed in on this field in advance. It would     be truer to say that when the Committee, after a long discussion of this     year’s 199 candidates, finally selected the IAEA and ElBaradei, we     came to the realisation that once again the prize was going to someone who     favours reducing the importance of nuclear arms in international politics. The atom bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki 60 years     ago. Since then, the world has been united in the wish that nothing like     that must ever happen again. Such weapons are so dreadful that they are meaningless     in war. Naturally enough, memories of the atom bombs have been strongest     of all in Japan, where people who survived the two atom bombs can still be     found. The survivors have a special name, Hibakusha, and their own organization,     Nihon Hidankyo. We salute them today. It is accordingly highly appropriate,     even though it is a coincidence, that it is the Japanese ambassador to the     IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who is at present the chairman of the organization’s     Board of Governors, and who will therefore receive the one half of the award     on behalf of the IAEA. Let us recall the story of the little girl, Sadako Sasaki,     who as an infant was exposed to radiation from the Hiroshima bomb. Suffering     as a twelve-year-old from deadly leukaemia, she heard the Japanese legend     which tells us that if you fold one thousand cranes you can wish for anything     you like. And Sadako began folding a thousand cranes, wishing to get well.     According to popular legend, she died when she had folded 644 birds; her     classmates folded the remaining 356. Sadako was buried with a wreath of 1,000     cranes. Her classmates and friends had a granite statue of her erected in     the Peace Park in Hiroshima. The statue shows Sadako as a young girl with     her arms out, and with a crane in her hand. Thousands of folded cranes are     left by the statue every year. Most of us dream of a future without nuclear weapons.     We would finally be rid of the threat to mankind’s very existence which     the weapons represent. Those who do not dream of such a future tend to say     that nuclear arms can not be uninvented, and maintain that if and when a     war does break out, there will be pressure to develop nuclear arms again.     The answer to this was given by Joseph Rotblat, the 1995 Laureate, for whom     a memorial ceremony was held in London yesterday: Our long-term vision must     be to put an end to war as such. We must banish war in the same way as the     world has largely succeeded in banishing slavery, the commonest of social     institutions. Several Nobel Peace Prizes have been awarded to the many     who oppose nuclear weapons. The successes have nevertheless been few and     the setbacks many. Even the IAEA has had disappointments. But we can not     give up. The basic challenge still confronts us. In the words of the Russell–Einstein    manifesto of 1955: “Here then is the problem which we present to you,     stark and dreadful, and inescapable: shall we put an end to the human race     or shall we renounce war”. That is the question. Shall we put an end     to the human race or shall we renounce war?  Here is how the Norwegian author Nordahl Grieg put it     in his poem “To Youth”: War is contempt for life.          Peace is creative.     At it with all your might:     See death defeated! We congratulate you, Mohamed ElBaradei, and we congratulate     the IAEA, on being awarded this year’s Nobel Peace Prize. We thank     you for what you have done, and hope for further advances in work that is     so vital to us all."
"79","2006","Muhammad Yunus, Grameen Bank"," Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Laureates, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, “The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2006, divided into two equal parts, to Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank for their efforts to create economic and social development from below. Lasting peace can not be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty. Micro-credit is one such means. Development from below also serves to advance democracy and human rights.” Those were the words in which the Nobel Peace Prize award was announced on the 13 th of October this year. Today the time has come for well-deserved celebration! Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank: congratulations on the Nobel Peace Prize! And congratulations to you, Mosammat Taslima Begum, who will receive the prize on behalf of Grameen Bank. Not all the journalists covering the announcement of the award at the Nobel Institute knew who Yunus and Grameen Bank were. Some thought Grameen Bank was a person. Let that be the reporters’ problem. The many who did know of both held that they ought to have received the Peace Prize long ago. In 2002, Bill Clinton put it this way: “Dr. Yunus is a man who long ago should have won the Nobel Prize and I’ll keep saying that until they finally give it to him.” Now Clinton will no longer need to remind us. This year’s award has been well received, internationally, in Norway, and not least in Bangladesh. It almost defies comprehension that when, as chairman of the Nobel Committee, I walk up to a microphone at the Nobel Institute in Oslo and announce that this year’s Peace Prize is going to Yumus and Grameen Bank, politicians and papers in large parts of the world begin to comment on, and to a large extent to applaud, the Norwegian Nobel Committee’s choice. And what is even harder to believe: there is an outbreak of joyful demonstrations in Bangladesh. For several days one could almost have described the country as closed because of happiness. Many said that this was the greatest thing to have happened to the country since independence in 1971. In recent weeks, growing numbers of people have become acquainted with the outlines of Yunus’s exciting story. Trained in economics in the United States, he returned to Bangladesh in 1972 and took a chair in economics at the University of Chittagong. In 1974 he underwent a personal crisis during the country’s famine. It shook him to see such poverty. And he asked himself, “What is the point of all these splendid economic theories when people around me are dying of hunger?” As early as in 1976, he hit on the idea of opening a bank for poor people. He lent 27 dollars out of his own pocket to 42 craftsmen in a little village in Bangladesh, telling them that they could pay the money back when they could afford to. In the weeks that followed, he gave the matter a great deal of thought, and decided that there would have to be an institutional solution. The result was Grameen Bank, which is present today in the vast majority of Bangladesh’s thousands of villages, and which since its formal opening in 1983 has lent almost six billion dollars. Today the bank has almost seven million borrowers. Grameen Bank lends 800 million dollars per year, in loans averaging just over one hundred dollars. The bank is self-financing and makes a profit. The repayment percentage is very high. Muhammad Yunus says, “Lend the poor money in amounts which suit them, teach them a few sound financial principles, and they manage on their own”. By means of this year’s Peace Prize award, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to focus attention on dialogue with the Muslim world, on the women’s perspective, and on the fight against poverty. First, we hope that this Peace Prize will represent a possible approach to the Muslim part of the world. Since the 11th of September 2001, we have seen a widespread tendency to demonize Islam. It is an important task for the Nobel Committee to try to narrow the gap between the West and Islam. The Peace Prize to Yunus and Grameen Bank is also support for the Muslim country Bangladesh and for the Muslim environments in the world that are working for dialogue and collaboration. All too often we speak one-sidedly about how much the Muslim part of the world has to learn from the West. Where micro-credit is concerned, the opposite is true: the West has learned from Yunus, from Bangladesh, and from the Muslim part of the world. Secondly, this year’s Peace Prize places women centre-stage. Over 95 per cent of the borrowers are women, and their liberation is a major concern for Yunus and Grameen Bank. The emphasis on women may have been the most important factor in the success of their work. Women were not alone to begin with, but their proportion rose rapidly. In Yunus’s words, “For women to be granted the loan has a definite effect on the family. There is no need to do more research on that today. Children benefit automatically, with better clothes and food. We can see the situation changing”. Men often spend the money on themselves; women spend it on the family. The bank’s practice has meant a social revolution in Bangladesh. One of the borrowers, Mazeda Begum, has put it like this: “My parents gave me the birth, but Grameen Bank gave me a life”. In today’s terminology, micro-credit is indeed “female empowerment”. Micro-credit has proved itself to be a liberating force in societies where women in particular have to struggle against repressive social and economic conditions. Economic growth and political democracy can not achieve their full potential unless the female half of humanity on earth contributes on an equal footing with the male. Thirdly, and most importantly, we have the fight against poverty and for social and economic development. Muhammad Yunus has shown himself to be a leader who has managed to turn visions into practical action for the benefit of millions of people, not only in Bangladesh but also in many other countries. There are now micro-credit programs in nearly one hundred countries all over the world, including Norway. Loans to poor people, most often women, without any financial security had appeared to be an impossible idea. From modest beginnings three decades ago, Yunus has, first and foremost through Grameen Bank, developed micro-credit into an ever more important instrument in the struggle against poverty. Grameen Bank has been a source of ideas and models for the many institutions in the field of micro-credit that have sprung up around the world. Numbers soon multiply and swell. But behind each number there is an individual human being. Every single person on earth has both the potential and the right to live a decent life. Across cultures and civilisations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that the poor can work to bring about their own development. In Yunus’s words, “Micro-credit is a well-tried and well-founded method that can bring financial services to the poorest of the poor. Micro-credit promotes entrepreneurship, and puts each individual poor person, especially women, in the driving-seat in their own lives”. Even beggars have become borrowers in the bank. Yunus believes firmly that alms destroy the initiative and creativity of poor people. As he wanders about in his Bengalese clothes, Yunus is sometimes referred to as a modern Gandhi. He is called the banker of the poorest. And Grameen Bank, which means the village bank, is the world’s biggest bank for poor people. Through their deposits, poor people own 94 per cent of the bank. The remaining 6 per cent belong to the Government of Bangladesh. The bank is based on a different philosophy from that of normal banks. Yunus says micro-credit is more about people than about money. It is a question of trusting people. Credit means to trust, to give someone “credit”. The poor people organize themselves into groups, often of five women. It is the group that is granted the loan and is responsible for repayment. The group meets regularly to sharpen each other’s perceptions of borrowing, work, repayment and saving. The members undertake to work for food production, pure drinking water, hygiene, health, family planning, economy, discipline, community and motivation in the group and in their families. The groups form networks with other groups. At the grass-roots level the groups thus help to build up communities. Groups of women who assume responsibility have also recently been points of departure for vaccination and health programs. The struggle against poverty in the world is an existential struggle for survival. Today roughly half the world’s people live on less than two dollars a day, and more than one billion live on less than one dollar a day, which is extreme poverty. This means that the majority of people on earth are poor. And the majority of them are women and children. This may be the greatest challenge confronting the world over the next few decades. Every country and nation in the world must contribute. It is shameful that far over half the people in the world live under such conditions. The struggle against poverty is work for peace of the first order. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Kofi Annan, has said that “Today borders do not go between nations, but between the powerful and the powerless, the free and the enslaved, the privileged and the subservient”. The United Nations’ number one Millennium Development Goal is to halve global poverty by 2015. Achieving that goal will require global mobilisation. Will you join in, will your country join in, will national leaders join in to meet this challenge? There is a long way to go, but we must travel it together. The aim must be peace with justice in the world. And justice means a life in dignity. The Norwegian Nobel Committee underlines that “lasting peace can not be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty”. Peace with justice must be built from below, by means to which Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank have contributed. The Norwegian Nobel Committee is often asked which concept of peace it applies. The question has come up this year, too. Although the response to this year’s award to Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank has been generally favourable, some have asked what micro-credit has to do with peace. They deserve an answer. The point of departure is always Alfred Nobel’s will. But the fact is that the three criteria for the peace prize which Nobel mentions in his will, work for “fraternity between nations”, for “the abolition or reduction of standing armies”, and for “the holding of peace congresses”, only provide limited guidance. That leaves it to a large extent up to the Norwegian Nobel Committee itself to interpret and concretize the concept of peace. Ever since 1901, this has been a matter for dispute, if not so much within the Committee as in the public domain. When the very first prize was awarded, to Henri Dunant and Frédéric Passy, nearly everyone accepted the pacifist Passy. To some, however, Dunant presented a problem. Was his work relevant to peace? Certainly the Red Cross did excellent work once war had broken out, but what did they do to prevent war? The earliest prizes went to peace activists of various kinds, to statesmen and, as we have seen, to humanitarian organizations and persons. Then the Committee began awarding the Peace Prize to campaigners for human rights. Again there were prompt counter-arguments. What did human rights have to do with peace? Did not the emphasis on such rights on the contrary tend to arouse conflict? In the 1980s, however, a growing number of political scientists began to take an interest in Immanuel Kant’s analyses of the connection between democracy and peace. In due course, more and more of them came to the conclusion that democracies were peaceful, at least in relation to other democracies. This has now become one of the most “robust” findings in modern political science. It is gratifying to see science now giving its almost unanimous support to a view which the Norwegian Nobel Committee has held for decades. In 2004, the Nobel Committee maintained that there was a connection between a depleted environment and war and conflict. This year the theme is the struggle against poverty. What has that got to do with peace? This is not something the Norwegian Nobel Committee only hit on this year. Many previous prizes have gone to the struggle against poverty. The distinction between humanitarian work and the struggle against poverty is of course not clear, as the three prizes to the Red Cross and the awards to the High Commissioner for Refugees, Médécins sans Frontières, Mother Teresa etc. all show. In addition, the Nobel Committee has awarded the Peace Prize to the founder of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), John Boyd Orr, and to the man behind the green revolution in agriculture, Norman Borlaug. So in principle this year’s Peace Prize is less of a novelty than many appear to believe, even granting that micro-credit as a tool for overcoming poverty is completely new in the context of the Peace Prize. Sound common sense is not to be despised. Most people would probably agree that the fact that wealthy Europe has been at peace in recent decades, while there have been many conflicts in poverty-stricken Africa, must have something to do with living conditions. The causal connections are complicated; everything can rarely if ever be attributed to a single factor. We would nevertheless intuitively believe that there must be a connection between poverty and conflict. But we do not have to rely solely on intuition. In the summary of research on this subject in Human Security Report 2005, we read that “Indeed, one of the most striking findings to emerge from conflict research is that most wars take place in poor countries, and that as per capita income increases, the risk of war declines”. This is not to say that poor people are necessarily more violent than the more prosperous. Central government resources are also important. The more prosperous a country is, the more resources it has with which to resolve the problems that can give rise to conflict. There is not just one way out of poverty. There are many. This year, however, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wants to draw attention especially to micro-credit. This instrument has produced good results in Bangladesh. Over the past few decades the country has recorded considerable economic growth. Some of that growth is certainly due to the operations of Grameen Bank and other institutions in the micro-credit field. It will be important to increase the use of this instrument. In the book Banker to the poor. The story of the Grameen Bank, Yunus asks whether it is really possible to imagine a world without poverty. His own answer is as follows: “We have created a slavery-free world, a polio-free world, an apartheid-free world. Creating a poverty-free world would be greater than all these accomplishments while at the same time reinforcing them. This would be a world that we could all be proud to live in”. Around year 750 the Chinese poet Tu Fu wrote, in Peter Bilton’s translation: Swarming cities are smithies for swords
Better forge a ploughshare, forge a harrow
Where there now are tears and sand
There would be silk and corn
The widow would be a farmer’s wife at her silk loom
The soldier a farmer behind his ox and plough
Our silent people a choir in a song
For two voices, singing of silk and corn. Today the Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to express its admiration for the work Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank have done for thousands upon thousands of ordinary people in Bangladesh and in many other countries. We hope the Peace Prize will be a source of inspiration in the continuing work for a world without poverty. That is not a goal we shall reach in the next few decades. But we are on the way. Today we congratulate and celebrate the two of you, Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank. Bangla: Apnader Shobaikay Ushno Obhhindon: Warmest congratulations to you all! Tomorrow we shall hurry on together towards the goal of a world without poverty."
"80","2007","Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Al Gore"," Norwegian  Your Majesties, Your Royal Highness, Laureates, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,      The Norwegian Nobel Committee’s announcement on the 12th of October of this year’s Peace Prize award opened with the following words: “The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2007 is to be shared, in two equal parts, between the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Albert Arnold (Al) Gore Jr. for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.” I congratulate the IPCC and Al Gore on this year’s Peace Prize! The Oxford Dictionary of Contemporary World History describes the Nobel Peace Prize as “the world’s most prestigious prize”. The Norwegian Nobel Committee feels a heavy sense of responsibility in selecting a winner for such an honourable prize. The steady increase in the number of nominees also makes the decision harder. Besides, some controversy attaches to this year’s Laureates. Nevertheless, this year’s award decision was not especially difficult. For it is rare for the world to be so concerned with a particular phenomenon or for that phenomenon to have such a decisive impact on our existence on earth. This year a great deal is hinging on global warming. Processes that have been going on for a long time are accelerating. The ice is melting more rapidly in the Arctic, the desert is spreading more quickly in Africa, the glaciers are shrinking in the Himalayas. In country after country, climate-related issues are moving up the political agenda. The two who, in the opinion of the Nobel Committee, should be given the greatest credit for this development are this year’s Laureates, the IPCC and Al Gore. The IPCC, the United Nations’ climate panel, is a unique body, as its name alone indicates. The climate panel was established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). This was a follow-up on the so-called Brundtland Report Our Common Future, which had been submitted the year before and which gave rise to the first wave of discussion of the environment and the climate. On a day like today, Gro Harlem Brundtland also deserves her share of the credit for the advances we have in fact made in our understanding of environmental problems. Whereas the Brundtland Report was wide-ranging, the IPCC was given a more delimited mandate. The world’s scientists were invited to participate in a continuous process aimed at assessing global climate change with regard to its degree, causes, and consequences, and to counter-measures. Currently over 130 countries are taking part, with 450 authors and 800 contributors, while 2,500 scientific experts take part in the hearings. Governments also take part in the reviews of the reports. The climate panel is, in other words, a quite extraordinary global project. The U.N. climate panel has arrived at its conclusions through a form of work that is fundamentally innovative. Previous mobilizations of the scientific community have often had moral foundations, for instance in the campaigns against nuclear weapons or for human rights. In the case of the IPCC, it is the United Nations and the nations of the world that have initiated a large-scale and continuous mobilization of the scientific community’s knowledge concerning climate change. Similar procedures to the IPCC’s should be considered as ways of approaching problems also in other fields. Biological diversity, desertification, and over-fishing of the seas have been mentioned. The IPCC’s very first report, presented in 1990, was to prove very influential, principally in that it became one of the basic documents at the U.N. Conference on Environment and Climate in 1992. The second report, in 1995, laid much of the foundation for the Kyoto Agreement of 1997, which has played such a significant part in the international debate on global warming. For the first time, extensive and coordinated international steps were carried out to counteract global warming. The third report, in 2001, further consolidated the scientific base. Now we have just received the fourth report. When the Nobel Days are over, the Laureates are travelling to Bali, to join the representatives of more than 180 countries in preparing the ground for the agreement which is to replace the Kyoto Agreement with effect from 2012. We wish them good luck. What happens, or does not happen, at Bali will determine our common future. Some say that the world’s scientists do not all agree in their analyses of human-induced global warming. Things which all the world’s scientists are fully agreed on are few and far between. That is in the nature of research. But there is little doubt about the main trends: more and more scientists have reached ever closer agreement concerning the increasingly dramatic consequences that will follow from global warming. Whereas in the 1980s global warming might be viewed as an interesting hypothesis, the 1990s produced firmer evidence of the real situation. In the last few years, the connections have become much clearer and the consequences still more apparent. We thank the IPCC for its outstanding scientific work! While the IPCC has laid the scientific foundations for our knowledge about climate change, Al Gore is in the opinion of the Norwegian Nobel Committee the single individual who has done most to prepare the ground for the political action that is needed to counteract climate change. He is the great communicator. He reaches people all over the world with his message. As early as in the 1970s, as a young member of the House of Representatives, Al Gore organized hearings on emissions of greenhouse gases, then seen as a relatively exotic subject. Many derogatory terms were applied to his commitment, not least in the USA. In 1992, Gore published the book Earth in the Balance, which wound up with a proposal for a global Marshall Plan to save the biosphere. The book became a best-seller in the USA. It showed impressive insight, built on a broad scientific platform, and spoke in a distinctly political and activist tone of voice. Gore was into his stride. As Vice President, Al Gore signed the Kyoto Agreement, but the Senate opposed United States ratification. After his defeat in the presidential election in 2000, he laid the foundations for a completely new career, as the world’s leading political spokesman on the environment. We know of all his achievements in the last few years, from book, film and concert to distinctions, honour and prizes. Political defeats can also bring good results! Again and again, Gore has hammered in his message, not least to Americans. The USA is, along with China, the great polluter. But that also entails a responsibility for becoming the leader in emission reduction. No one can charge Gore with lacking concrete guidelines for what individuals can do. An Inconvenient Truth contains sixteen tightly-packed pages of advice on “what you personally can do to help solve the climate crisis”. We all have a responsibility, small countries and large, all mankind, but the heaviest responsibility rests on the rich nations, which to a large extent created global warming. Behind Gore’s total commitment there is unquenchable optimism. He watched the world take up arms against tobacco and achieve a high degree of success, at least in many rich countries. Cancer took his sister’s life. Where tobacco was concerned, too, strong interests had claimed that there was insufficient evidence. No one is in any doubt any longer. We thank Al Gore for his great courage and unremitting struggle! There was for a long time great doubt about whether global warming was man-made. Thanks to the IPCC there is very little such doubt today. Then there are those who doubt that there is any connection between the environment and the climate on the one hand and war and conflict on the other. Why have the IPCC and Al Gore been awarded a Nobel Prize for peace? The Norwegian Nobel Committee has always had a broad approach to peace. Its opinion has been that there are many different paths to peace. A number of these paths have been contentious, not so much among ordinary people, who are inclined to believe that any good cause deserves the Peace Prize, as among scholars, whose task it is to study interrelations between phenomena. When the Nobel Committee handed out human rights prizes, scholars queried the connection between democracy and peace. Today they no longer ask. The connection is now regarded as among the most “robust” in modern political science. The traditional concept of peace and security emphasises war between states. In order to protect all the individuals of which states consist, it is of course important to prevent any attack from outside. But wars between states have become increasingly rare. Wars within states, on the other hand, have grown more frequent. Many more people are killed today in civil wars than in wars between states. Those who attach importance to “human security” argue that the main thing is to protect individuals. The chief threats may be direct violence, but deaths may also have less direct sources in starvation, disease, or natural disasters. A goal in our modern world must be to maintain “human security” in the broadest sense. Environmental problems certainly affect human security in this broad sense. When low-lying areas are flooded, their inhabitants will no longer have any form of security. In the words of last year’s Laureate, Muhammad Yunus, “My country Bangladesh is already paying a very high price for global warming and stands to face even greater challenges in the future. As natural calamities intensify year on year, climate change has already become a question of survival”. We can already see how millions of refugees from Bangladesh are creating social and political tensions in India. Melting glaciers, and rivers which first overflow and then have their rate of flow reduced or dry out, mean dramatic changes in people’s everyday lives. In many places, such events are coinciding with rapid increases in population. Such cities as Quito, La Paz and Lima are affected by the melting of glaciers in the Andes; the rivers from the glaciers in the Himalayas supply half of the fresh water needed by 40 per cent of the world’s population. Desertification in China and Africa is threatening vast land areas. In some parts of the world global warming can be beneficial. We see farming being undertaken in northern regions where it has hitherto been difficult or impossible. Nevertheless, Inuit and Sami people are worried. Sheila Watt-Cloutier has said that this year it was planet earth that got the Peace Prize. The overall effect is negative. In the south the picture is even clearer. The effect will be particularly damaging for those who are already in the greatest difficulty, the weak states and vulnerable people who are least well-equipped to meet the new challenges. They are paying a high price for a problem largely brought about by the wealthy countries to the north. Unfortunately we can already establish that global warming not only has negative consequences for “human security”, but can also fuel violence and conflict within and between states. It can be argued that the melt-down in the Arctic is giving a sharper edge to the new series of sovereignty claims that we are seeing in this northernmost part of the world. The consequences are most obvious, however, among the poorest of the poor, in Darfur and in large sectors of the Sahel belt, where we have already had the first “climate war”. The wind that blows the sand off the Sahara sets people and camels moving towards more fertile areas. The outcome is that nomads and peasants, Arabs and Africans, Christians and Muslims from many different tribes clash in a series of conflicts. There are many dimensions to this, but it is growing increasingly obvious that desertification is a central underlying factor. The pattern from Darfur has now spread to Chad and the Central African Republic. Large parts of the Sahel belt, from the Sudan to Senegal, are coming under threat. It is not only the Norwegian Nobel Committee that sees interrelations between nature and the environment, war and conflict. So does the UN Security Council. In April this year, on Britain’s initiative, the Security Council held its first debate on the effect of climate on war and conflict. The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, said in his careful way that “when resources are scarce – whether energy, water or arable land – our fragile ecosystems become strained, as do the coping mechanisms of groups and individuals. This can lead to a breakdown of established codes of conduct, and even outright conflict”. Climate and the environment have thus become one of the threats “to international peace and security” which the UN Security Council is meant to deal with. A committee of prominent American military officers recently stated that climate changes are “a threat multiplier for instability in some of the most volatile regions of the world”. The Norwegian Nobel Committee rarely raises its voice. Our style is largely sober. But it is a long time since the committee was concerned with such fundamental questions as this year. Desmond Tutu, Peace Prize Laureate in 1984, put it as follows in Tromsø’s Arctic Cathedral in connection with World Environment Day on the 5th of June: “To ignore the challenge of global warming may be criminal. It certainly is disobeying God. It is sin. The future of our fragile, beautiful planet is in our hands. We are stewards of God’s creation”. We congratulate the IPCC and Al Gore on receiving this year’s Peace Prize. We thank you for what you have done for mother earth, and wish you further success in a task that is so vital to us all. Action is needed now. Climate changes are already moving beyond human control. Thank you for your attention. "
"81","2008","Martti Ahtisaari"," Norwegian  Your Majesties, Your Royal Highness, Laureates, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,      The Norwegian Nobel Committee’s announcement on the 10th of October of this year’s Peace Prize award began as follows: “The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2008 to Martti Ahtisaari for his important efforts, on several continents and over more than three decades, to resolve international conflicts. These efforts have contributed to a more peaceful world and to ‘fraternity between nations’ in Alfred Nobel’s spirit.” We congratulate Martti Ahtisaari on this year’s Peace Prize!  Paljon onnea, Martti Ahtisaari! The 10th of December is the most important date in the Nobel year. On that day the prizes for medicine, physics, chemistry and literature are awarded in Stockholm. The economics prize in memory of Alfred Nobel is also awarded there. We salute each and every one of the Laureates who will be receiving their awards in Stockholm a little later today. And the Peace Prize, as you see, is awarded in Oslo. Nobel laid down in his will that it should be awarded by a committee “of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting”. Here we are, up on the stage, together with the Committee’s Secretary. Nobel also decided that all the prizes should be awarded on the basis of achievements “during the preceding year”. On that point I think all the committees must simply admit their failings. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, at any rate, has to declare that there was nothing so very special about 2008 that it could have led to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Ahtisaari today.  For it is being awarded to him precisely for “his important efforts, on several continents and over more than three decades”. It is not easy to take every sentence in Nobel’s will absolutely literally. In Norway we feel that we know Ahtisaari well. Many Norwegians have met him; many of them are here today. He has had a long career as both a Finnish and an international politician. What is more, he has Norwegian roots!  His great-grandfather was from Tistedalen in the county of Østfold. I see that Ahtisaari himself wondered in an interview whether it might be held against him that he was allegedly “12.5 per cent Norwegian”. It may well be that we have treated Norwegian candidates especially restrictively in recent decades. In 1921 and 1922, however, the Norwegian Nobel Committee was bold enough, awarding the Prize first to Christian Lange and in the following year to Fridtjof Nansen. So two Norwegians have received the Peace Prize, as against five Swedes and one Dane. Not until today has the Prize gone to a Finn. But in that connection we have listened to Alfred Nobel. He urged that the worthiest candidate should receive the Prize “whether he be Scandinavian or not”. Martti Ahtisaari was born in Viborg, but during the Winter War he moved with his mother to Kuopio and later to Uleåborg. His father was at the front. His experience in Viborg, then Finland’s second largest city, which was incorporated into the Soviet Union after the war, and from which almost the entire Finnish population moved, “explains my desire to advance peace and thus help others who have gone through similar experiences as I did”. As early as in 1960, when he was only 23, Ahtisaari went to Karachi in Pakistan, where for three years he was in charge of building up a YMCA centre for physical education and teacher training. This accustomed him to living in an international environment.  In 1965, after studying at the  Helsinki University of Technology, Ahtisaari was recruited to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His special interest there was development aid. Ahtisaari was to have nearly the whole world as his field of activity.  In 1973 he became Finnish Ambassador to Tanzania.  In 1977 he was appointed United Nations Commissioner for Namibia as well as the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Namibia. Namibia was to be for fourteen years the country to which he devoted his greatest efforts, although in the same period he also undertook several different international and Finnish assignments. Of his many achievements as a peace negotiator, Ahtisaari rates his work in Namibia highest. The mediation took such a long time. There were so many players and dimensions involved. The United States and the Soviet Union engaged themselves. The Cold War made itself very much felt also in southern Africa. In the neighbouring country Angola a civil war was fought in which both Cuba and South Africa participated. Namibia was formally under UN supervision, but was in fact ruled by South Africa. The independence movement SWAPO grew steadily stronger. The peace process was stimulated by the end of the Cold War. It also moved forward thanks to the emergence of a new white South   Africa under F.W. de Klerk. But at the very centre of all this, holding all the threads in his hand, stood Martti Ahtisaari. He has been called “Namibia’s midwife”. A midwife sometimes stands between life and death. No single diplomat did more than he did to deliver Namibia’s independence, on the 21st of March 1990, after 24 years’ struggle.  Today Ahtisaari is an honorary citizen of the country. Many boys in Namibia have been named after Martti. That must be at least as great an honour as being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. We thank Ahtisaari for his work in Namibia! In Namibia, Ahtisaari had a mandate from the United Nations. For many years, he was obliged to relate to many different parties at many different levels. The situation in Aceh was completely different. There was a grave dispute over the status of Aceh between the central government authorities in Djakarta on the one hand and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) on the other. GAM had been seeking independence since 1976. There had been bloody battles. As it always does, the civilian population suffered most from the conflict. At least 15,000 people lost their lives. One village became known as the “Widows’ town”. Its men had either been killed or disappeared up into the mountains. In 2003 a peace accord concluded the previous year had broken down. Everything appeared to be back where it started. The parties had not spoken to one another for 20 months. In that situation, with his organization Crisis Management Initiative (CMI), Ahtisaari launched an initiative. They had no international mandate. They saw opportunities where others only saw conflict. But they did think the work would take time. As Ahtisaari said, “When a married couple have not spoken to each other for 20 months, you can’t expect love to bloom immediately”. Love may not have bloomed, but the negotiations made rapid progress. In January 2005, Ahtisaari and CMI brought the parties together in Finland. Seven months later, the government and GAM signed a peace treaty in Helsinki. A natural disaster contributed to the solution. The indescribable tsunami had hit Aceh particularly hard. At least 170,000 people died there. For all its horror, the disaster prepared the ground for peace. But natural catastrophes do not necessarily pave the way to peace. We saw that in Sri Lanka, where developments took a wrong turning despite the tsunami. Someone had to bring the parties together. Someone had to provide a suitable context. Ahtisaari and CMI managed to get the parties to agree that Aceh was to be part of Indonesia, but with extensive autonomy. GAM would hand in their weapons and be transformed into a political party. The process has gone surprisingly well, although challenges remain.  An election is to be held in April 2009. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia has called Ahtisaari “the master of peace”. We thank Ahtisaari for the solution in Aceh! The Balkans are the third region in which Ahtisaari’s mediation has produced significant results. In Bosnia-Hercegovina he worked as a mediator for the United Nations. In 1999 he contributed, together with Russia’s Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, to bringing the war over Kosovo to an end. It was the two of them between them who got Slobodan Milosevic to stop the war. Ahtisaari is not one to boast about his achievements. Concerning Kosovo, he has said in an interview that Chernomyrdin and he “did not negotiate with Milosevic. We simply presented an offer which would make it easier to put a stop to the bombing, provided he committed the Yugoslav government to certain principles”. No one can solve every international problem. Sometimes the parties are too far apart. In such cases, we have to be satisfied if the matter is brought just a few steps closer to a solution. For the past few years, Ahtisaari has striven hard to find a lasting solution for Kosovo. In November 2005 he was appointed Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General for the future status of Kosovo.  This was a difficult task. The parties were very far apart, divided by centuries of bitter history. The last twenty years had seen a more or less continuous crisis.  Serbia was fundamentally opposed to independence for Kosovo. There was nothing the Kosovo Albanians, eventually accounting for over 90 per cent of the population, for their part wanted more. In Aceh, a compromise was found.  In Kosovo, no compromise was possible. In January 2007, Ahtisaari put forward his proposal for a solution. Kosovo would become virtually independent, subject only to some international supervision. The Serbs in Kosovo would be granted considerable autonomy, and have the right to maintain certain ties with Serbia.  The proposal met with massive opposition in Serbia. The Kosovo Albanians were just as strongly in favour. Ahtisaari’s proposed solution was never adopted by the UN Security Council.  Russia, with her close links to Serbia, was against it.  In July 2007, Ahtisaari declared his mission over.  Further negotiations, inspired by the USA, the EU and Russia, failed to produce a solution that both parties could accept.  So on the 17th of February 2008, the Kosovo Albanians declared Kosovo independent.  The new state was quickly recognised by the USA and most EU countries, and today over fifty countries have taken the same step. On the 10th of October Ahtisaari heard that Macedonia and Montenegro had recognised Kosovo.  Then he got the phone call about the Nobel Peace Prize. It must have been a good day! Serbia, with Russia’s support, still objects to the new state. It can nevertheless be said that Ahtisaari’s solution for Kosovo has to a large extent been put into practice. Kosovo has become independent. The conflict had no other solution.  There are, however, many signs that the Serbian minority will be more or less integrated with Serbia, contrary to Ahtisaari’s plan. We thank Ahtisaari for his work to solve the Kosovo conflict. The scale and scope of Ahtisaari’s activities are almost beyond belief. His greatest achievements have been mentioned. They are linked to Namibia, Aceh, and Kosovo. But he has also made important contributions to peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, in Central  Asia, and on the Horn of Africa. In addition to all this, he has managed to serve for six years as Finland’s President.  During his term, from 1994 to 2000, Finland’s economy underwent significant improvement. Finland joined the European Union. Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton met in Helsinki. But with the Finnish political establishment in attendance here in the Oslo City   Hall, we must take care not to give Ahtisaari too much of the credit for these developments. In 2008, Ahtisaari and Crisis Management Initiative have been involved in negotiations concerning peace in Iraq. In April, in Helsinki, in cooperation with several American institutions, and with Ahtisaari as “senior adviser”, CMI induced 36 Iraqi politicians to agree on a declaration in principle on peace in Iraq. The declaration stated that dialogue and negotiations must be the most important keys to solving the country’s problems. “Facilitators”, as they are called, from Northern Ireland and South Africa are also engaged in this work. CMI and Ahtisaari are continuing to lend a hand in the ongoing process. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has often awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the parties in a conflict. It is the parties, and their representatives, who take the personal and political risk of entering into peace agreements. But mediators, too, face major challenges. And the parties in a conflict nearly always need help in reaching their objectives. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has honoured mediators from Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 to Kofi Annan in 2001 and Jimmy Carter in 2002. Ahtisaari is in other words one of an exclusive group of peace negotiators who have made decisive contributions to peace and reconciliation in the world. His efforts have been untiring, and he has achieved good results. Ahtisaari has shown what parts mediators of many different kinds can play in the resolution of even the most difficult international conflicts. Mediators no doubt differ as widely as most people. Ahtisaari has for his part said, “I have learned that you do not achieve peace just by saying nice things to the parties. You have to be sincere. You have to have the courage to tell people that they are acting counter-productively. I am sincere. I am not always amiable.”  This may not sound too difficult. In Aceh, he asked the parties head on:  “Do you want to win the war, or do you want peace?” Optimism is important in mediation efforts. Ahtisaari believes every conflict can be resolved. Every:  that’s optimism for you. Having Finnish “sisu” must have been a great help. So must the support of his wife, Eeva. The ability to listen, and to go straight to the core of problems, is decisive. It has often been said, moreover, that you achieve most if you are not too busy winning credit for yourself. That need not prevent one from afterwards receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. Only very few of us can become peace mediators at a high international level.  But we can all be peace mediators at a national or local level, in the neighbourhood, at schools, or in families. In this respect universities and schools can make valuable contributions. Ahtisaari has put it as follows: “We must all look in the mirror and ask ourselves have I done my best for peace.” I usually wind up my Nobel addresses with literary quotations. This year the writer has to be Finnish. The words were written in 1926 by Frans Eemil Sillanpää. In 1939 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, the only Finn to have won it. The translation from Finnish to Norwegian is by Jan Erik Kaplon, and from Norwegian to English by Peter Bilton. I read it as a greeting from Finland’s only Literature Laureate to the country’s first Peace Prize Laureate: “At bottom, all humanity shares a common fate. Our distress is common.   We must therefore honour the efforts every human being makes to alleviate and remove our common distress.   Every war is a disgrace to those who wage it, and to the whole of mankind.  War always ends in misery. Man only does his good deeds in times of peace.  Only then are we able to prevent distress.  Whoever builds peace, builds humanity.”  “Se joka rakentaa rauhaa, rakentaa ihmisyyttä.” We congratulate Martti Ahtisaari on the Nobel Peace Prize. Parhaat onnittelut, Martti Ahtisaari! The Norwegian Nobel Committee hopes that others will be inspired by your efforts and your results.    "

Produced by NRK Your Majesties, Mr. President and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Your Royal Highnesses, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, On the 9th of October this year, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 was to be awarded to President Barack H. Obama “for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples. The Committee has attached special importance to Obama’s vision of and work for a world free from nuclear weapons”. Commenting on the award, President Obama said he did not feel that he deserved to be in the company of so many transformative figures that have been honoured by this prize, and whose courageous pursuit of peace has inspired the world. But he added that he also knew that the Nobel Prize had not just been used to honor specific achievements, but also to give momentum to a set of causes. The Prize could thus represent “a call to action”. President Obama has understood the Norwegian Nobel Committee perfectly. We congratulate him on this year’s Nobel Peace Prize! This year’s award must be viewed in the light of the prevailing situation in the world, with great tension, numerous wars, unresolved conflicts and confrontation on many fronts around the world. And, not least, there is the imminent danger of the spread of nuclear weapons, degradation of the environment and global warming. In fact, Time Magazine recently described the decade that is coming to an end as the worst since the end of World War II. From the very first moment of his presidency, President Obama has been trying to create a more cooperative climate which can help reverse the present trend. He has already “lowered the temperature in the world”, in the words of former Peace Prize Laureate Desmond Tutu. The Committee always takes Alfred Nobel’s will as its frame of reference. We are to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the person who, during the “preceding year”, meaning in this case since the previous award in December 2008, shall have done the most or the best work “for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses” – to quote from the will. The question was actually quite simple. Who has done most for peace in the past year? If the question is put in Nobel’s terms, the answer is relatively easy to find: it had to be U.S. President Barack Obama. Only rarely does one person dominate international politics to the same extent as Obama, or in such a short space of time initiate so many and such major changes as Obama has done. The question for the Committee was rather whether it would be bold enough to single out the most powerful man in the world, with the responsibility and the obligations that come with the office of the President of the United States. The Committee came to the conclusion that it must still be possible to award the Nobel Peace Prize to a political leader. We cannot get the world on a safer track without political leadership. And time is short. Many have argued that the prize comes too early. But history can tell us a great deal about lost opportunities. It is now, today, that we have the opportunity to support President Obama’s ideas. This year’s prize is indeed a call to action to all of us. The Committee knows that many will weigh his ideals against what he really does, and that should be welcomed. But if the demand is either to fulfil your ideals to the letter, and at once, or to stop having ideals, we are left with a most damaging division between the limits of today’s realities and the vision for tomorrow. Then politics becomes pure cynicism. Political leaders must be able to think beyond the often narrow confines of realpolitik. Only in this way can we move the world in the right direction. Obama has achieved a great deal. Multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position, with emphasis on the role that the United Nations and other international institutions can play. Former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld said that “the U.N. was not created to take humanity to heaven, but to save it from hell”. The U.S.A. is now paying its bills to the U.N. It is joining various committees, and acceding to important conventions. International standards are again respected. Torture is forbidden; the President is doing what he can to close Guantanamo. Human rights and international law are guiding principles. This is why this year’s Laureate has earned the praise of the leaders of international institutions. New opportunities have been created. Your Majesties, Mr. President, Your Royal Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen, The vision of a world free from nuclear weapons has powerfully stimulated disarmament and arms control negotiations. Under Obama’s leadership, the U.N. Security Council gave its unanimous support to the vision of a world without nuclear weapons. The new administration in Washington has reconsidered the deployment in Eastern Europe of the planned anti-missile defences and is instead looking at other multilateral options to secure the region. This has contributed to an improved atmosphere in the negotiations on strategic nuclear weapons between the U.S.A. and the Russian Federation. A new agreement between them will, we hope, soon be on the table. We can see how the vision of a world without nuclear weapons is encouraging even the smaller nuclear powers to make cuts. And we can certainly not prevent the spread of nuclear arms to new countries unless the established nuclear powers meet their obligations. That was the clear premise underlying the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and it still applies today. The important Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference is being held next year. Either the nuclear powers will clearly signal their willingness to disarm, or the conference may prove a fiasco, with the danger of a new arms race. President Obama has sent his signal. In today’s Washington, dialogue and negotiations are the preferred instruments for resolving even the most difficult international conflicts. The United States is no longer on the sidelines regarding the nuclear program in Iran. As the President put it in his inaugural address: “…we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist”. There is no guarantee that negotiations always succeed, but in Obama’s opinion the U.S.A. is obliged to try. If the outstretched hand continues to meet a clenched fist, the global community will then stand more united in its further response. Obama has insisted that the U.S.A. has to build coalitions and make friends rather than to create enemies. He is pursuing this strategy also in Afghanistan. The struggle against violent extremism in Afghanistan rests on broad international foundations and is supported actively by many governments around the world. In the long run, however, the problems in Afghanistan can be solved only by the Afghans themselves. This is also the basic logic behind the President’s new strategy there. Regarding the fight against climate change, we can see the same underlying idea: the U.S.A. cannot be indifferent to global challenges; while it cannot solve such challenges alone, they cannot be met without the U.S.A. Obama has presented concrete proposals for what the U.S.A. will do. This has improved chances of reaching an effective global agreement, if not this year then, we hope, at least next year. China is steadily moving to the forefront of international politics and the global economy. There has been a sense in America that many of the greatest challenges can only be met in close cooperation with the People’s Republic of China. For instance, no country has polluted more than the U.S.A., and no country will pollute more than China in the future. The economies of the two countries are closely intertwined. The rise of new Great Powers often leads to war and conflict. There are those in America who fear that history may repeat itself in that respect. The Obama administration’s cooperation with Beijing means that we have little reason to fear such a repetition. Obama’s diplomacy rests on the idea that whoever is to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world’s population. That was how they put it, those earlier American presidents who, above all others, were seen as world leaders also outside the United States: Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. America’s ideals were the world’s ideals: they lived, in Reagan’s words, “not only in the hearts and minds of our countrymen but in the hearts and minds of millions of the world’s people in both free and oppressed societies who look to us for leadership”. Obama’s ideals coincide to a large extent with the ideals that have underpinned the activities of the Norwegian Nobel Committee throughout our 108-year history: to strengthen international institutions as much as possible; to advance democracy and human rights; to reduce the importance of arms and preferably do away with nuclear arms altogether; to promote dialogue and negotiations; and, in the last few years, to adopt effective measures to meet the climate threat. Looking at the history of the Nobel Prize, we can see several examples of awards to persons or institutions that have achieved fundamental agreements or other results which have stood the test of history. We will find at least as many awards that have gone to those who tried to bring about fundamental changes in international politics, but where the results were still unclear at the time when they received their awards. Woodrow Wilson’s prize came when he was at his weakest both politically and personally, after suffering a stroke. He had created the League of Nations, but the United States would not join. Wilson was a hero to the world, but not in the U.S.A. The American Secretary of State Cordell Hull received the award after the establishment of the United Nations, but so early that no one could be sure how significant the U.N. would be. Many have been awarded the Peace Prize for their courage, even when the results for a long time seemed modest: Carl von Ossietzky, Andrej Sakharov, Lech Walesa and the Dalai Lama, to name a few. When Albert Lutuli received his Peace Prize, the struggle against apartheid was in its infancy: there were few results to point to. When Martin Luther King, Jr., received his award, he had proclaimed his dream that “my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character”, but there was still a long way to go from dream to reality. Mr. President, we are happy to see that through your presence here so much of Dr. King’s dream has come true. In the Middle East, there have been many wars, and many Peace Prizes have been awarded. Why does the Nobel Committee not wait until final peace agreements have been concluded? Nothing is final in history. It always moves on. Peace must be built again and again. The Norwegian Nobel Committee can not award a Peace Prize where nothing has been achieved. If the principles are important enough, however, and the struggle over them is vital to the future of the world, the Committee can not wait until we are certain that the principles have won on all fronts. That would make the Prize a rather belated stamp of approval and not an instrument for peace in the world. Your Majesties, Mr. President, Your Royal Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. President, in both the First and the Second World War, your great country came to Europe’s rescue. We will never forget that. After the First World War, Woodrow Wilson sought to build a world founded on international cooperation and democracy. His success was limited. During and after the Second World War, Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman took initiatives to create the United Nations and other global institutions. Their creation still lives on today. The lesson was that the power of nation states could not be unlimited. States must commit themselves to international law and universal rights. The world moved away from unrestrained nation states and towards greater internationalism. Today yet another American president is trying to renew internationalism. He reaffirms that the U.S.A. must lead together with others. Walls must be torn down. As he put it in his speech in Berlin in July 2008: “The walls between old allies on either side of the Atlantic cannot stand. The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand. The walls between races and tribes; natives and immigrants; Christians and Muslims and Jews cannot stand. These now are the walls we must tear down”. This must surely be Nobel’s “fraternity between nations”. Your Majesties, Mr. President, Your Royal Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen, President Obama is a political leader who understands that even the mightiest are vulnerable when they stand alone. He is a man who believes in the strength of a community, be it the local community where he started his career many years ago or the global community which he leads today. Obama has the audacity to hope and the tenacity to make these hopes come true. This is what makes him so important. By his own behaviour and leadership he is demanding that we all “take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges”. We congratulate this year’s Laureate, President Barack H. Obama, on what he has already achieved, and wish him every possible success in his continuing efforts for a more peaceful world. May you receive the help you truly deserve!"
"83","2010","Liu Xiaobo","    Your Majesties, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, “The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2010 to Liu Xiaobo for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has long believed that there is a close connection between human rights and peace. Such rights are a prerequisite for the “fraternity between nations” of which Alfred Nobel wrote in his will.” This was the first paragraph of the Norwegian Nobel Committee’s announcement on the 8th of October of the award of this year’s Peace Prize. We regret that the Laureate is not present here today. He is in isolation in a prison in north-east China. Nor can the Laureate’s wife Liu Xia or his closest relatives be here with us. No medal or diploma will therefore be presented here today. This fact alone shows that the award was necessary and appropriate. We congratulate Liu Xiaobo on this year’s Peace Prize. There have been a number of previous occasions when the Laureate has been prevented from attending. This has in fact been the case with several awards which have proved in the light of history to have been most significant and honourable. Even when the Laureate has come, he or she has several times been severely condemned by the authorities of his or her own country. There was a great deal of trouble in 1935, when the Committee gave the award to Carl von Ossietzky. Hitler was furious, and prohibited all Germans from accepting any Nobel Prize. King Haakon did not attend the ceremony. Ossietzky did not come to Oslo, and died a little over a year later. There was considerable outrage in Moscow when Andrej Sakharov received his Prize in 1975. He, too, was prevented from receiving the award in person. He sent his wife. The same thing happened to Lech Walesa in 1983. The Burmese authorities were furious when Aung San Suu Kyi received the Peace Prize in 1991. Once again, the Laureate could not come to Oslo. In 2003, Shirin Ebadi received the Nobel Peace Prize. She came. Much could be said of the reaction of the Iranian authorities, but the Iranian Ambassador did in fact attend the ceremony. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has given four Prizes to South Africa. All the Laureates came to Oslo, but the awards to Albert Lutuli in 1960 and to Desmond Tutu in 1984 provoked great outrage in the apartheid regime in South Africa, before the applause broke out thanks to the awards to Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk in 1993.     The point of these awards has of course never been to offend anyone. The Nobel Committee’s intention has been to say something about the relationship between human rights, democracy and peace. And it has been important to remind the world that the rights so widely enjoyed today were fought for and won by persons who took great risks. They did so for others. That is why Liu Xiaobo deserves our support. Although none of the Committee’s members have ever met Liu, we feel that we know him. We have studied him closely over a long period of time. Liu was born on the 28th of December 1955 in Changchun in China’s Jilin province. He took a Bachelor’s degree in literature at Jilin University, and a Master’s degree and a PhD at Beijing Normal University, where he also taught. Stays abroad included visits to Oslo, Hawaii, and Columbia University, New York. In 1989 he returned home to take part in the dawning democracy movement. On the 2nd of June he and some friends started a hunger strike on Tiananmen  Square to protest against the state of emergency that had been declared. They issued a six-point democratic manifesto, written by Liu, opposing dictatorship and in favour of democracy. Liu was opposed to any physical struggle against the authorities on the part of the students; he tried to find a peaceful solution to the tension between the students and the government. Non-violence was already figuring prominently in his message. On the 4th of June he and his friends tried to prevent a clash between the army and the students. He was only partially successful. Many lives were lost, most of them outside Tiananmen Square. Liu has told his wife that he would like this year’s Peace Prize to be dedicated to “the lost souls from the 4th of June.” It is a pleasure for us to fulfil his wish. Liu has said that “The greatness of non-violent resistance is that even as man is faced with forceful tyranny and the resulting suffering, the victim responds to hate with love, to prejudice with tolerance, to arrogance with humility, to humiliation with dignity, and to violence with reason.” Tiananmen became a turning-point in Liu’s life. In 1996, Liu was sentenced to three years in a labour camp for “rumour-mongering and slander.” He was president of the independent Chinese PEN-centre from 2003 to 2007. Liu has written nearly 800 essays, 499 of them since 2005. He was one of the chief architects behind Charter 08, which was made known on the 10th of December 2008, which was, in the words of the document’s Preamble, on the occasion of “the one hundredth anniversary of China’s first Constitution, the 60th anniversary of the promulgation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 30th anniversary of the birth of the Democracy Wall, and the 10th anniversary of the Chinese government’s signature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.” Charter 08 defends fundamental human rights and has in due course been signed by several thousand persons both in China itself and abroad. On the 25th of December 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment and two years’ loss of political rights for, in the words of the sentence, “incitement to the overthrow of the state power and socialist system and the people’s democratic dictatorship.” Liu has consistently claimed that the sentence violates both China’s own constitution and fundamental human rights. There are many dissidents in China, and their opinions differ on many points. The severe punishment imposed on Liu made him more than a central spokesman for human rights. Practically overnight, he became the very symbol, both in China and internationally, of the struggle for such rights in China. Your Majesties, ladies and gentlemen, During the cold war, the connections between peace and human rights were disputed. Since the end of the cold war, however, peace researchers and political scientists have almost without exception underlined how close those connections are. This is, allegedly, one of the most “robust” findings they have arrived at. Democracies may go to war against dictatorships, and have certainly waged colonial wars, but there is, apparently, not a single example of a democracy having gone to war against another democracy. The deeper “fraternity between nations” which Alfred Nobel mentions in his will, and which is a prerequisite for real peace, can hardly be created without human rights and democracy. There are scarcely any examples in world history of a great power achieving such rapid growth over such a long period of time as China. Since 1978, year by year, decade after decade, the country’s growth rate has stood at 10 percent or more. A few years ago the country’s output was greater than Germany’s; this year it exceeded Japan’s. China has thus achieved the world’s second largest gross national product. The USA’s national product is still three times greater than China’s, but while China is continuing its advance, the USA is in serious difficulties. Economic success has lifted several hundred million Chinese out of poverty. For the reduction in the number of poor people in the world, China must be given the main credit. We can to a certain degree say that China with its 1.3 billion people is carrying mankind’s fate on its shoulders. If the country proves capable of developing a social market economy with full civil rights, this will have a huge favourable impact on the world. If not, there is a danger of social and economic crises arising in the country, with negative consequences for us all. Historical experience gives us reason to believe that continuing rapid economic growth presupposes opportunities for free research, thinking and debate. And moreover: without freedom of expression, corruption, the abuse of power, and misrule will develop. Every power system must be counterbalanced by popularly elected control, free media, and the right of individual citizens to criticise. More or less authoritarian states may have long periods of rapid economic growth, but it is no coincidence that nearly all the richest countries in the world are democratic. Democracy mobilises new human and technological resources. China’s new status entails increased responsibility. China must be prepared for criticism and regard it as positive – as an opportunity for improvement. This must be the case wherever there is great power. We have all formed opinions on the role of the USA through the years. Friends and allies criticised the country both for the Vietnam War and for the lack of civil rights for the coloured people. Many Americans were opposed to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Martin Luther King in 1964. Looking back, we can see that the USA grew stronger when the African-American people obtained their rights. Many will ask whether China’s weakness – for all the strength the country is currently showing – is not manifested in the need to imprison a man for eleven years merely for expressing his opinions on how his country should be governed. This weakness finds clear expression in the sentence on Liu, where it is underlined as especially serious that he spread his opinions on the Internet. But those who fear technological advances have every reason to fear the future. Information technology can not be abolished. It will continue to open societies. As Russia’s President Dmitrij Medvedev put it in an address to the Duma: “The new information technology gives us an opportunity to become connected with the world. The world and society are growing more open even if the ruling class does not like it.” No doubt Medvedev had the fate of the Soviet Union in mind. Compulsory uniformity and control of thought prevented the country from participating in the technological revolution which took place in the 1970s and 80s. The system broke down. The country would have stood to gain a great deal more from entering into a dialogue at an early stage with people like Andrej Sakharov. Your Majesties, ladies and gentlemen, Today neither the nation-state nor a majority within the nation-state has unlimited authority. Human rights limit what the nation-state and the majority in a nation-state can do. This must apply to all states that are members of the United Nations and who have acceded to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. China has signed and even ratified several of the UN’s and the ILO’s major international conventions on human rights. It is interesting that China has accepted the supranational conflict-resolving mechanism of the WTO. China’s own constitution upholds fundamental human rights. Article 35 of the country’s constitution thus lays down that “Citizens of the People’s Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and of demonstration.” Article 41 begins by stating that citizens “…have the right to criticise and make suggestions regarding any state organ or functionary.” Liu has exercised his civil rights. He has done nothing wrong. He must therefore be released! In the past 100 to 150 years, human rights and democracy have gained an ever-stronger position in the world. And with them, peace. This can be clearly seen in Europe, where so many wars were fought, and whose colonial powers started so many wars around the world. Europe today is on the whole a continent of “peace”. Decolonization after the Second World War gave a number of countries, first in Asia and then in Africa, the chance to govern themselves with respect for basic human rights. With India in the lead, many of them seized the opportunity. Over the latest decades, we have seen how democracy has consolidated its position in Latin America and in Central and Eastern Europe. Many countries in the Muslim part of the world are treading the same path: Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia. Several other countries are in the process of opening up their political systems. The human rights activists in China are defenders of the international order and the main trends in the global community. Viewed in that light, they are thus not dissidents, but representatives of the main lines of development in today’s world. Liu denies that criticism of the Communist Party is the same as offending China and the Chinese people. He argues that “Even if the Communist Party is the ruling party, it cannot be equated with the country, let alone with the nation and its culture.” Changes in China can take time, a very long time: political reforms should, as Liu says, ” be gradual, peaceful, orderly and controlled.” China has had enough of attempts at revolutionary change. They only lead to chaos. But as Liu also writes, “An enormous transformation towards pluralism in society has already taken place, and official authority is no longer able to fully control the whole society.” However strong the power of the regime may appear to be, every single individual must do his best to live, in his words, “an honest life with dignity.”       The answer from the Chinese authorities is to claim that this year’s Peace Prize humiliates China, and to give very derogatory descriptions of Liu. History shows many examples of political leaders playing on nationalist feelings and attempting to demonize holders of contrary opinions. They soon become foreign agents. This has sometimes happened in the name of democracy and freedom, but almost always with a tragic outcome. We recognise this in the rhetoric of the struggle against terrorism: “You are either for me or against me.” Such undemocratic methods as torture and imprisonment without sentence have been used in the name of freedom. This has led to more polarisation of the world and harmed the fight against terrorism. Liu Xiaobo is an optimist, despite his many years in prison. In his closing appeal to the court on the 23rd of December 2009, he said: “I, filled with optimism, look forward to the advent of a future free China. For there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom, and China will in the end become a nation ruled by law, where human rights reign supreme.” Isaac Newton once said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” When we are able to look ahead today, it is because we are standing on the shoulders of the many men and women who over the years – often at great risk – have stood up for what they believed in and thus made our freedom possible. Therefore: while others at this time are counting their money, focussing exclusively on their short-term national interests, or remaining indifferent, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has once again chosen to support those who fight – for us all. We congratulate Liu Xiaobo on the Nobel Peace Prize for 2010. His views will in the long run strengthen China. We extend to him and to China our very best wishes for the years ahead."
"84","2011","Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Leymah Gbowee, Tawakkol Karman"," Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Laureates, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen   Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Leymah Gbowee, and Tawakkol Karman: Ever since the Norwegian Nobel Committee made this year’s decision known, the people of Norway have looked forward to seeing you on this stage. All those with empathy for children and women who are ill-treated and killed, all those who believe in a future free from violence and war, will acclaim you today out of respect for the will to act that you represent. You give concrete meaning to the Chinese proverb which says that “women hold up half the sky”. That was why, when giving its reasons for this year’s award, the Nobel Committee stated that “We cannot achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women acquire the same opportunities as men to influence developments at all levels of society”. We thank you for the hope you awaken in us all. And we congratulate you on this year’s Peace Prize. Men and women have at all times experienced war in different ways. Although women, too, have fought in wars through the centuries, and today even engage in terrorism, it is the men who to a far greater extent have engaged in the actual warfare. In modern wars the majority of the victims are often civilian, and very many of them are women and children. Rape has always been one of the horrors of war. But in recent years, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Darfur, in Rwanda, and in Congo, among many other places, we have seen rape working not just as a massive violation in itself. Rape has become part of the tactics of war. The aim is to break down the enemy’s morale, to force populations to move, and to punish opponents also after the war is over. This was defined as a crime against humanity and as war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia . The International Criminal Court (ICC) has since reached the same conclusion. Popular opinion in favour of this view must be strengthened, and that is what we are doing here today. We are doing so by attracting renewed attention to the resolution adopted in October 2000 by the UN Security Council, Resolution 1325. The resolution for the first time made violence against women in wartime an international security issue. It underlined the need to have women become participants on an equal footing with men in peace processes and in peace work in general. Women had to break out of their roles as victims; they must themselves become players who will contribute to creating peace. These goals were then hammered out further in four new Security Council resolutions, 1820, 1888, 1889 and 1960.These resolutions must be given prominent and visible places on the desks of all heads of state. For there is still a long way to go before the goals of these resolutions are reached. In recent peace negotiations in various parts of the world which are surveyed, fewer than 8 per cent of the participants in the negotiations and fewer than 3 per cent of the peace agreement signatories were women. No woman has ever been appointed chief negotiator in any peace negotiations led by the UN. Meanwhile the rapes continue, thousands of them, day after day. The situation of women is difficult in many parts of the world. When a little progress is made, it is often men who benefit most. A brief illustration: Bicycles have in recent years made their entry in rural districts in many poor countries. The women, who often both till the soil, carry goods to market, and see that the children get to school, rarely get to use the bicycle. It is for the male member of the family. Far too often, he uses it to visit the local bar, and now he can also get to the bars in the neighbouring villages. As so many have pointed out, help for women is help for the family; help for men is unfortunately far too often only help to them alone. Investment in girls’ education is probably the best investment any developing country can make. But luckily women are not only victims. Some take action. Three of them are today receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for 2011. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s whole life can be seen as a realization of the intentions of Resolution 1325. In 1980 she went into exile after having been imprisoned and threatened with rape. For several years she served as Director of the UNDP’s Regional Bureau for Africa. She was one of seven eminent persons who investigated the genocide in Rwanda on behalf of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). When the civil war broke out in Liberia in 1989, Johnson Sirleaf first supported Charles Taylor in the hope that he might represent a solution, but gradually dissociated herself from him, and ran against Taylor, unsuccessfully, in the presidential election in 1997. In the election in 2005, however, Johnson Sirleaf won a convincing victory, which made her the first democratically elected female head of state on the African continent. Liberia remains one of the poorest countries in the world, and faces huge problems, but much progress has nevertheless been made since Johnson Sirleaf was installed as President in 2006. The civil war is over; democracy is working; there has been considerable economic growth; the very widespread corruption has been somewhat reduced; women’s education and participation in social life has been significantly strengthened; the monstrous number of rapes has diminished. Few other persons better satisfy the criteria for receiving the Peace Prize mentioned in Alfred Nobel’s will.  Congratulations! The same applies to Leymah Gbowee. She is the trauma specialist who switched from treating war victims to working for peace. In 2002, she mobilized a network of over 2,000 women in 15 provinces in Liberia to protest against the war and the violence. They dressed in white and took their stand near Monrovia’s fish market. It was very important that Gbowee managed to unite women with quite different religious and ethnic backgrounds in this struggle. During the peace negotiations in Ghana, the women in frustration shut the male negotiators in and threatened to strip themselves naked, something which in that country would have brought utter disgrace on the men. As we know, they were able to keep their clothes on. A peace agreement was reached. Gbowee’s work inspired many women to engage in a non-violent struggle against war and violence and for women’s rights. As a network-builder, she took the initiative in forming the Women in Peacebuilding Network (WIPNET), which focused not only on Liberia but also on other parts of West Africa. Gbowee currently heads the Women Peace and Security Network Africa (WIPSEN), headquartered in Accra in Ghana. We hope this year’s prize will help to strengthen this network. Congratulations! Yemen is the country in the world which has made the least progress where women’s rights are concerned. In her home, Peace Prize Laureate Tawakkol Karman keeps pictures of her heroes, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Hillary Clinton. Many years before the Arab Spring in 2011, she was a youth and female activist. She became a journalist and founded the organization Women Journalists Without Chains. She organized peaceful sit-ins and information campaigns; she trained other women to take part in this struggle. In a country where the vast majority of women wear niqabs, Tawakkol Karman changed to the hijab. She is at the same time a member of an Islamic party. In 2011 she was one of the leaders of the demonstrations on Change Square in Sana. She was imprisoned and exposed to serious threats, but nothing stopped her. Day in and day out, she has campaigned against President Ali Abdullah Saleh and for democracy, women’s rights, and tolerance. She advocates understanding between Shias and Sunnis and between Islam and other religions. The promising Arab Spring will become a new winter if women are again left out. The visible as well as the invisible and indirect violence to them must cease. Women must be fully accepted in all sectors of community life. In her own way of life and struggle, Karman has shown that Islam presents no obstacle to this. On the contrary, Islam must be part of the solution. Only then will there be democracy and peaceful development in this part of the world. That will mean greater security for all of us. What Karman has achieved in a short space of time is incredible. As a 32-year-old, she is the youngest laureate in the history of the Peace Prize. Her struggle is our struggle. Congratulations and good luck for the future! The leaders in Yemen and Syria who murder their people to retain their own power should take note of the following: mankind’s fight for freedom and human rights never stops. No dictator can in the long run find shelter from this wind of history. It was this wind which led people to crawl up onto the Berlin Wall and tear it down. It is the wind that is now blowing in the Arab world. Not even President Saleh was able and President Assad in Syria will not be able to resist the people’s demand for freedom and human rights. As we have with us today two strong women from Liberia – the country that was built by slaves who had the opportunity to return to Africa, and since we have an equally strong woman from a country, Yemen, where the women are at present demanding freedom, I shall conclude with a quotation from the American author and civil rights advocate James Baldwin, who wrote: “The people that once walked in darkness are no longer prepared to do so.” Make a note of that! – all those who wish to be on the right side of history. We congratulate this year’s winners of the Nobel Peace Prize. You represent one of the most important motive forces for change in today’s world, the struggle for human rights in general and the struggle of women for equality and peace in particular. Thank you for your attention."
"85","2012","European Union (EU)"," Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Heads of State, Heads of Government, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, Honourable Presidents of the European Union, At a time when Europe is undergoing great difficulties, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has sought to call to mind what the European Union means for peace in Europe. After the two world wars in the last century, the world had to turn away from nationalism and move in the direction of international cooperation. The United Nations were formed. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted. For Europe, where both world wars had broken out, the new internationalism had to be a binding commitment. It had to build on human rights, democracy, and enforceable principles of the rule of law. And on economic cooperation aimed at making the countries equal partners in the European marketplace. By these means the countries would be bound together so as to make new wars impossible. The Coal and Steel Community of 1951 marked the start of a process of reconciliation which has continued right to the present day. Beginning in Western Europe, the process continued across the east-west divide when the Berlin Wall fell, and has currently reached the Balkans, where there were bloody wars less than 15 to 20 years ago. The EU has constantly been a central driving force throughout these processes of reconciliation. The EU has in fact helped to bring about both the “fraternity between nations” and the “promotion of peace congresses” of which Alfred Nobel wrote in his will. The Nobel Peace Prize is therefore both deserved and necessary. We offer our congratulations. In the light of the financial crisis that is affecting so many innocent people, we can see that the political framework in which the Union is rooted is more important now than ever. We must stand together. We have collective responsibility. Without this European cooperation, the result might easily have been new protectionism, new nationalism, with the risk that the ground gained would be lost. We know from the inter-war years that this is what can happen when ordinary people pay the bills for a financial crisis triggered by others. But the solution now as then is not for the countries to act on their own at the expense of others. Nor for vulnerable minorities to be given the blame. That would lead us into yesterday’s traps. Europe needs to move forward. Safeguard what has been gained. And improve what has been created, enabling us to solve the problems threatening the European community today. This is the only way to solve the problems created by the financial crisis, to everyone’s benefit. In 1926, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the Peace Prize to the Foreign Ministers of France and Germany, Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann, and the following year to Ferdinand Buisson and Ludwig Quidde, all for their efforts to advance Franco-German reconciliation. In the 1930s the reconciliation degenerated into conflict and war. After the Second World War, the reconciliation between Germany and France laid the very foundations for European integration. The two countries had waged three wars in the space of 70 years: the Franco-Prussian war in 1870-71, then the First and Second World Wars. In the first years after 1945, it was very tempting to continue along the same track, emphasizing revenge and conflict. Then, on the 9th of May 1950, the French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman presented the plans for a Coal and Steel Community. The governments in Paris and Bonn decided to set history on a completely different course by placing the production of coal and steel under a joint authority. The principal elements of armaments production were to form the beams of a structure for peace. Economic cooperation would from then on prevent new wars and conflicts in Europe, as Schuman put it in his 9th of May speech: “The solidarity in production thus established will make it plain that any war between France and Germany becomes not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible”. The reconciliation between Germany and France is probably the most dramatic example in history to show that war and conflict can be turned so rapidly into peace and cooperation. The presence here today of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande makes this day particularly symbolic. The next step after the Coal and Steel Community was the signing of the Treaty of Rome on the 25th of March 1957. The four freedoms were now established. Borders were to be opened, and the whole economy, not just the coal and steel industry, was to be woven into a whole. The six heads of state, of Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, wrote that they “by thus pooling their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty, and calling upon the other peoples of Europe who share their ideal to join in their efforts, have decided to create a European Economic Community …”. In 1973, Great Britain, Ireland and Denmark decided to respond to this call. Greece joined in 1981, and Spain and Portugal in 1986. Membership of the EEC and EU was the right of all European countries “whose system of government is founded on the principles of democracy” and who accept the conditions for membership. Membership consolidated democracy in these countries, not least through the generous support schemes from which Greece, Portugal and Spain were able to benefit. The next step forward came when the Berlin Wall fell in the course of a miraculous half year in 1989. Opportunities opened up for the neutral countries Sweden, Finland and Austria to become members. But the new democracies, too, wished to become parts of the West, militarily, economically and culturally. In that connection membership of the EU was a self-evident objective. And a means, enabling the transition to democracy to be made as painlessly as possible. If they were left to themselves, nobody could be certain how things would turn out. For history has taught us: freedom comes at a price. The difference is very marked between what happened after the fall of the Berlin Wall and what is now happening in the countries of the Arab world. The Eastern European countries were quickly able to participate in a European community of values, join in a large market, and benefit from economic support. The new democracies in the vicinity of Europe have no such safe haven to make for. The transition to democracy also looks like being long and painful and has already triggered war and conflict. In Europe the division between east and west was broken down more quickly than anyone could have anticipated. Democracy has been strengthened in a region where democratic traditions were very limited; the many disputes over ethnicity and nationality that had so troubled the region have largely been settled. Mikhail Gorbachev created the external conditions for the emancipation of Eastern Europe, and national leaders headed by Lech Walesa took the necessary local initiatives. Both Walesa and Gorbachev received their well-deserved Peace Prizes. Now at last it is the EU’s turn. Events during the months and years following the fall of the Berlin Wall may have amounted to the greatest act of solidarity ever on the European continent. This collective effort could not have come about without the political and economic weight of the EU behind it. On this day we must also pay tribute to the Federal Republic of Germany and its Chancellor Helmut Kohl for assuming responsibility and accepting the enormous costs on behalf of the inhabitants of the Federal Republic when East Germany was included practically overnight in a united Germany. Not everything was settled yet, however. With the fall of communism an old problem returned: the Balkans. Tito’s authoritarian rule had kept a lid on the many ethnic conflicts. When that lid was lifted, violent conflicts blazed up again the like of which we had thought we would never see again in a free Europe. Five wars were in fact fought in the space of a few years. We will never forget Srebrenica, where 8,000 Muslims were massacred in a single day. Now, however, the EU is seeking to lay the foundations for peace also in the Balkans. Slovenia joined the EU in 2004. Croatia will become a member in 2013. Montenegro has opened membership negotiations, and Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have been given candidate status. The Balkans were and are a complicated region. Unresolved conflicts remain. Suffice it to mention that the status of Kosovo is still not finally settled. Bosnia-Hercegovina is a state that hardly functions owing to the veto the three population groups have become entitled to exercise against each other. The paramount solution is to extend the process of integration that has applied in the rest of Europe. Borders become less absolute; which population group one belongs to no longer determines one’s security. The EU must accordingly play a main part here, too, to bring about not only an armistice but real peace. For several decades Turkey and the EU have been discussing their relations to each other. After the new government, headed by the AKP party, won a clear parliamentary majority, the aim of EU membership has provided a guideline for the process of reform in Turkey. There can be no doubt that this has contributed to strengthening the development of democracy there. This benefits Europe, but success in this respect is also important to developments in the Middle East. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has time and again presented the Peace Prize to champions of human rights. Now the prize is going to an organization of which one cannot become a member without first having adapted all one’s legislation to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. But human rights as such are not enough. We can see this now that country after country is undergoing serious social unrest because misplaced policies, corruption and tax evasion have led to money being poured into gaping black holes. This leads, understandably, to protests. Demonstrations are part of democracy. The task of politics is to transform the protests into concrete political action. The way out of the difficulties is not to dismantle the European institutions. We need to maintain solidarity across borders, as the Union is doing by cancelling debts and adopting other concrete support measures, and by formulating the framework for a finance industry on which we all depend. Unfaithful servants must be removed. These are preconditions for the continuing belief of the European masses in the compromises and moderation which the Union is now demanding of them. Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Heads of Government and Heads of State, ladies and gentlemen, Honourable Presidents of the European Union, Jean Monnet said that “nothing can be achieved without people, but nothing becomes permanent without institutions”. We are not gathered here today in the belief that the EU is perfect. We are gathered in the belief that here in Europe we must solve our problems together. For that purpose we need institutions that can enter into the necessary compromises. We need institutions to ensure that both nation-states and individuals exercise self-control and moderation. In a world of so many dangers, compromise, self-control and moderation are the principal needs of the 21st century. 80 million people had to pay the price for the exercise of extremism. Together we must ensure that we do not lose what we have built on the ruins of the two world wars. What this continent has achieved is truly fantastic, from being a continent of war to becoming a continent of peace. In this process the European Union has figured most prominently. It therefore deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. The frescos on the walls here in the Oslo City Hall are inspired by Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s frescos from the 1300s in the Siena town hall, named “Allegory of the effects of good government”. The fresco shows a living medieval town, with the gates in the wall invitingly wide open to spirited people bringing the harvest in from fruitful fields. But Lorenzetti painted another picture: “Allegory of the effects of bad government”. It shows Siena in chaos, closed and ravaged by the plague, destroyed by a struggle for power and war. The two pictures are meant to remind us that it is up to ourselves whether or not we are to live in well-ordered circumstances. May good government win in Europe. We are bound to live together on this continent.  Living together Vivre ensemble Zusammenleben Convivencia Birlikte  Yasamak Git’vemeste Leve sammen Congratulations to Europe. In the end we decided to live together.   May other continents follow. Thank you for your attention."
"86","2013","Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons","  Your Majesties, Your Royal Highness, representatives of the Laureate, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, The entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997 prohibiting the development, production, storage and use of chemical weapons states that the parties to the Convention are “Determined for the sake of all mankind, to exclude completely the possibility of the use of chemical weapons.” Is that not beautiful? Still more beautiful: it can be achieved.  We are in fact close to the target. This is to a large degree due to the work of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which was created to ensure the implementation of the Convention. The Nobel Peace Prize for 2013 therefore goes most deservedly to an organisation and its personnel, who have been quietly working to remove an entire category of weapons. Our congratulations! And with this year’s prize, we prompt those states that have not acceded to the convention to do so. The use of chemicals in warfare is nearly as old as mankind. For thousands of years, spears and arrows have had poison applied to them to enhance their effect. Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey tell us that such poisoned arrows were used by the parties to the Trojan War. Chinese Sun Tzu mentions the use of fire with various weapons. In Hinduism, the Law of Manu favours a ban on poison and fire arrows, recommending the poisoning of food and water instead. Up through the centuries, there are masses of examples of the use of various chemical weapons. In due course there followed demands for bans on such weapons. The Hague Convention from the Peace Congress of 1899, and the Convention from the Congress of 1907, recommended the prohibition of “poison and poison weapons” in the waging of war. But it was so little use. World War One marked the first massive use of chemical weapons in war. By the end of the war, a total of 124,000 tonnes of gas had been produced. 85,000 are reckoned to have lost their lives owing to chemical weapons, while almost 1.2 million were injured. In the wake of World War I, international efforts to ban the use of chemical weapons and prevent such suffering from being inflicted again, on soldiers and civilians, intensified. The result of this renewed global commitment was the 1925 Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and Bacteriological Methods of Warfare. But it did not have much effect, because it did not forbid the production and storage of such weapons. As long as possession of such weapons was permitted, there was a strong temptation to use them. Hitler used chemical means to take the lives of millions of people during World War Two, but surprised many by not making direct use of chemical weapons when waging the war itself. In Berlin they were probably afraid of what the Allied response might be if the Germans were the first to use such weapons. Their own forces might also suffer from their use on the battlefield. Since World War Two, chemical weapons have been used frequently. The former regime in Iraq made extensive use of chemical weapons both in the war on Iran in the 1980s and on its own Kurdish population. Terrorists have also used such weapons. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 had in other words not had the required effect. A more comprehensive agreement was clearly needed. The new Chemical Weapons Convention was drawn up in 1992-93. It prohibits the use, production and storage of such weapons. The Convention entered into force in 1997. The OPCW was established to see that the Convention was implemented. The OPCW’s objective, then, is not arms control, as so often in such connections; the objective is disarmament in the form of elimination of chemical weapons. In effect a huge step in human history. Because never before has a weapon, previously integrated in the armed forces and doctrines of states, been banned and its removal sought from the earth’s surface. The Convention, which entered into force in 1997, has rendered chemical weapons taboo under international law. The Convention imposes many and detailed obligations. All countries that ratify the agreement undertake to submit a full survey of whatever they may possess of chemical weapons and equipment for the production of such weapons. They furthermore undertake to destroy whatever they possess of such weapons and production facilities, and to admit international inspectors to ensure that such destruction has taken place.  The destruction must be carried out in cooperation with the OPCW. The OPCW has the right to inspect any production facility in a signatory state at 76 hours’ notice. 190 countries are currently members of the OPCW. The members represent 98 per cent of the world’s population and territory as well as 98 per cent of the world’s total chemical industry. 80 per cent of the chemical weapons have been removed. 90 per cent of the production capacity has been destroyed. We are accordingly quite close to achieving the highly ambitious target of totally eliminating chemical weapons. This is the result not only of cooperation between many countries, but also of cooperation undertaken between the business and industry, research institutions and organisations of those countries. Without such cooperation, the implementation of many of the provisions in the Convention would not have been possible. This year’s prize is therefore being awarded to a form of international cooperation of which we need more in other areas. But it has not all been successes. The OPCW was unable to observe the deadline, which was April 2012, for the destruction of declared chemical weapons. Some 20 per cent, chiefly American and Russian weapons, have not yet been destroyed. It is of course not acceptable that two leading powers, themselves so eager to see others destroying their stores as quickly as possible, have not yet themselves managed to do the same. Please, speed up the process! Now that Syria has joined the OPCW, only 6 states remain non-members. Two, Israel and Myanmar, have signed, but not ratified, the Convention. Please ratify it! Angola, North Korea, Egypt and South Sudan have neither signed nor ratified. Please do so! It marks a big step forward that Syria has joined the OPCW, and that plans are now being drawn up for the destruction of all its chemical weapons. It is of course a huge challenge for the OPCW to manage to destroy all these weapons under the conditions of war and chaos prevailing in the country, and in much less time than is normally available. The anonymous inspectors from the OPCW do an extremely important and difficult job. That makes the presence of many of you here today so significant. Today’s prize is also your prize. The target of removing chemical weapons from the surface of the earth is highly ambitious, but it is not necessarily the case that it will be achieved once and for all.  Development does not stop. We suspect the emergence of new forms of warfare, new types of chemical weapons, types which the world has not seen up to now and which are potentially dreadful in their consequences. Discussion of possible new substances that are not currently defined in the Convention will confront the OPCW with new challenges. We should never underestimate the policy of small steps. The follow-up on the Chemical Weapons Convention by the OPCW has shown how small steps can produce large results. The dominant direction of the Norwegian Nobel Committee’s work over the years has partly been the struggle for disarmament, but still more the struggle for international cooperation, whether through the League of Nations or the United Nations. The OPCW has its feet firmly planted in both traditions, which also figure so prominently in Alfred Nobel’s will. The current situation in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf lends an important perspective to the Chemical Weapons Convention and the existence of the OPCW, namely that such a multilateral framework once again became a platform from which to attempt to resolve a current crisis without the use of weapons. We were on the verge of a new military confrontation in the Middle East which could have unimaginable consequences. That has so far been avoided. The improved climate this creates may pave the way for negotiations for a solution to the whole conflict in Syria. We know from experience that one good step may be followed by others. I hope everyone is with me in a plea to the parties: lay down your arms, stop the bloodbath, come to the negotiating table. That the leadership of the Russian Federation saw that the Chemical Weapons Convention and the OPCW could be used to shift the conflict over chemical weapons onto a new track, and that President Obama responded favourably, may also have contributed to creating a new climate around Iran’s nuclear program. President Rouhani went to the UN General Assembly with a more favourable message than we have heard before.  A telephone conversation between the Presidents of Iran and the United States took place for the first time for over 30 years. An important, though as yet only preliminary, agreement has been concluded to limit Iran’s nuclear program. We know that a political solution in Syria and a peaceful solution to Iran’s nuclear weapons program are difficult. But developments are more promising than for a long time. Peace is a difficult issue, as we see even in the debate on the Nobel Peace Prize. Many feel that the prize should always go to bold individuals with firm principles. We need such role models to create hope in a complicated and for many a threatening world. The prize has often gone to such outstanding individuals. Many of them have moved the world in the right direction. But peace is not brought about by individuals and idealists alone. We also need practical politicians, capable of moving the world away from confrontation within often narrow limits. We also need institutions, not least the global ones within the United Nations. It is the interplay between all of these that can create peace. The Nobel Peace Prize has accordingly honoured all these directions. This must remain the Nobel Committee’s platform. Alfred Nobel’s will is a visionary document. And concrete at the same time. He wrote that the prize should go to whoever had done most for fraternity between nations, the reduction of standing armies, and the holding of peace congresses. The agreement of 2010 between Presidents Obama and Medvedev concerning strategic nuclear arms was important because the alternative was a new nuclear arms race. So it fitted in with a modern understanding of Alfred Nobel’s demand for the reduction of standing armies. The Chemical Weapons Convention and the work of the OPCW meet all of Alfred Nobel’s requirements. They concern disarmament, are a form of modern peace congress, and strengthen fraternity between nations. What is more: while negotiations concerning nuclear arms have been based on the exclusive right claimed by the nuclear powers to have nuclear arms, the Chemical Weapons Convention contains no such right. It is a real disarmament agreement. All countries must eliminate their chemical weapons. All nations are treated equally. This must be the perspective also where nuclear arms are concerned, as was resolved by the UN Security Council meeting called by President Obama in 2009. Nuclear weapons, too, must vanish from the face of the earth! Many people ask, not least in Syria itself, whether it really makes any difference whether one is killed by chemical weapons or by conventional means. For those who are hit, the answer is no, though no one should underestimate the suffering that chemical weapons impose on their victims. On the road to a more peaceful world, it is nevertheless important to combat the most monstrous weapons first, the weapons of mass destruction. We have banned the biological weapons. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded many prizes to the struggle against nuclear weapons. Today the focus is on chemical weapons, and on the progress we have made. The honour for that goes to the 1997 Convention and to the OPCW. We praise today’s laureate and extend our best wishes for success in the important tasks remaining. Thank you for your attention."

Publication in periodicals or books, or in digital or electronic forms, otherwise than in summary requires the consent of the Foundation. On all publications in full or in major parts the above underlined copyright notice must be applied. Thorbjørn Jagland, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, delivering the Presentation Speech at the Nobel Peace Prize Award Ceremony. Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, A conscience exists in the world which extends beyond all national boundaries, and is independent of religion, culture and social adherence:  it states that children have a right to childhood; they have a right to go to school instead of being forced to work. They are not to start life as the slaves of others. This “world conscience” can find no better expression than through Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai. Dear Nobel Prize Laureates, A stronger expression of Alfred Nobel’s appeal for fraternity between nations would be difficult to find except through you two. We are honoured to have you here. Congratulations! The road to democracy and freedom is paved with knowledge. Taliban and IS dislike knowledge because they know that it is an important condition for freedom. Attendance at school, especially by girls, deprives Taliban, IS, Boko Haram and similar movements of power. But nothing should be further from Islam than using suicide bombs against their co-religionists or shooting at a young girl whose only demand was to be allowed to go to school. Violence and repression can not be justified in any religion. Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism protect life and can not be used to take lives. The two whom we honour here today stand very firm on this point. They live according to a principle Mahatma Gandhi gave expression to. He said: “There are many purposes I would have died for. There are no purposes I would have killed for”. Satyarthi and Yousafzai are precisely the people whom Alfred Nobel in his will calls “champions of peace”. This they are not only behind a desk, but in practice. Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen, Kailash Sathyarthi’s vision is quite simply to put an end to child labour. Since he abandoned a promising career as an electrical engineer in 1980, this has been Sathyarthi’s overriding aim. He has worked at several different levels to achieve it. At grass-root level he has achieved the release of some 80,000 children, sometimes in very dramatic circumstances. He has often been brutally attacked. It takes little fantasy to imagine the reaction when he and his co-workers go into worn-down factory premises round about in India to set the children free. Powerful interests have profited from child labour. They do not give up without a struggle. Satyarthi himself has adhered to non-violence. The child labourers are not infrequently recruited by kidnapping, but are often also hired out by parents who cannot manage their debts. Enslavement to debt remains very widespread, not only in India but also in many other countries. Satyarthi insists that it is not poverty that leads to child labour. Child labour maintains poverty, carrying it on from generation to generation School attendance releases people from poverty. Satyarthi has developed a model for how liberated children can be rehabilitated and provided with education. They must be provided with a basic education to enable them to some extent to function as normal citizens rather than as slaves. He has set up a number of different organizations which work both in India and internationally to fulfil children’s rights. Bachpan Bachao Andolan is perhaps his most important instrument, taking direct action to set children free. Satyarthi’s struggle is marked by great inventiveness. Rugmark, established in 1994 (now Goodweave), is a striking example. It is an international consortium of representatives of countries which export and import rugs. We can all by simple means check that a rug has not been made by child labourers. A network of inspectors has been set up to ensure that the system works. The children get to go to school, and the adult workers earn a fair wage. Exporters and importers pay a small fee to keep up this system of inspections and controls. Efforts are in hand to spread the scheme to other products often made by child labour, such as knitted goods and sports gear. On the 17th of January 1998, Satyarthi embarked on his biggest project: The Global March Against Child Labour. Seven million children and adults took part in this march, which entered many different countries and regions. The march wound up at the ILO headquarters in Geneva. The following year the ILO convention against the worst forms of child labour was unanimously adopted. The convention has currently been ratified by 172 countries. No ILO convention has been ratified more quickly. ILO conventions 138 and 182, and the UN “Convention on the Rights of the Child”, now form the basis of the world-wide struggle against child labour and for education. Much nevertheless remains to be done. There are roughly 60 million child labourers in India alone, most of them in farming. If the country were to ratify the two ILO conventions, that would be a big step in the right direction. There are currently 168 million child labourers worldwide. In the year 2000, the figure was 78 million higher. In this, as in so many other areas, things are thus moving in the right direction, and often much faster than we think. Satyarthi indeed believes that child labour can be more or less eliminated in his own lifetime. Everyone here shares that hope. Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen, Malala Yousafzai is far and away the youngest Peace Prize Laureate of all time. Her story has nevertheless become known practically all over the world. When she was 11 or 12 she began under a pseudonym to write a blog for the BBC about what it was like to live in the Swat valley in northwest Pakistan, under heavy pressure from the Taliban and with only ambivalent support from the Pakistani authorities. The schools periodically had to close, especially girls’ schools. Malala Yousafzai’s vision was clear right from the start.  Girls had a self-evident right to education. Her courage is almost indescribable. We all know what happened on the 9th of October 2012, when Malala was 15. A gunman climbed into the school bus and asked for Malala. He fired three shots at her, injuring her most severely. Her life was saved, and she decided to continue her struggle for girls’ education, although Taliban have made no secret of their intention to try again. Pakistan’s population numbers nearly 200 million. One quarter are between 5 and 16 years old. The nation’s constitution guarantees all these children free and compulsory education. But nearly half the 52 million do not go to school; a large majority of them are girls. And it is not just Taliban that seeks to keep the girls away from school. The authorities do so, too, having built schools without walls, without running water, and without toilets. And at least as important: indoctrination is sometimes more important than the skills and knowledge needed in order to cope in a modern world. The teachers, too, often lack the minimum qualifications needed. Pakistani authorities have praised the award of the Peace Prize to Malala Yousafzai. The best gift they could give her would be dramatic improvements to the country’s education system. That would benefit the whole of Pakistan. Few things provide a larger economic and social yield than investments in girls’ education. This logic applies all over the world. By placing the individual person at the centre of all politics, one will soon see that those “excluded” are not a burden and a threat, but an enormous unused resource. Here in Europe, too, such logic would work wonders. The problem here is not that children and adolescents receive no education or are obliged to work. Far too many find no use for their education or find no opportunities for work. We need to leave this negative situation and instead give the younger generation the hope which is probably our strongest defence against extremism. Young people must be able to see into the future instead of being trapped by dark thoughts and dark forces. Ladies and gentlemen, While it is in the nature of extremism to create enemies and frightening images, and to divide the world into us and them, the laureates show us something else: A young girl and a somewhat older man, one from Pakistan and one from India, one Muslim, the other Hindu; both symbols of what the world needs: more unity. Fraternity between the nations! The Laureates have underlined that if the prize can contribute to bringing Indians and Pakistanis, two people so near to one another and yet so distant, closer to one another, this would add an extra dimension to the prize. We share this hope. Ladies and gentlemen, We need people like Satyarthi and Yousafzai to show that it helps to fight. Few if any of us have had greater courage to live according to Mahatma Gandhi’s principle that “I accept only one tyrant in the world, and that is the still small voice within me”. We others have perhaps become too accustomed to following the voices of others, pouring into our heads through the social media. We often forget to listen to our own voice, the one that talks to us about justice. Freedom and justice have never been ceremonial. The world never progressed thanks to coldly calculating people. It advanced thanks to the efforts of people with warm hearts. Your Majesties, ladies and gentlemen, We live in an age in which the world, despite all the violence and extremism we see around us, is marked by an increasing humanity. The author James Baldwin put it like this: “The people that once walked in darkness are no longer prepared to do so”. This has become an irrevocable part of our common awareness. Persons like Kailash Satiarthi and Malala Yousafzai have brought us there. They show that it helps to resist. Even under the most difficult conditions. Dear Nobel Prize Laureates, You will for all the future form part of the row of gold that forms our Nobel history – the row of campaigning people. People who have created the “global conscience” of which we can all be the bearers – the call for freedom and justice. The most important thing of all is to have children and young people set free! Thank you for your attention."
"88","2015","National Dialogue Quartet"," Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Laureate, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2015 to the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet for its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Revolution of 2011.  It gives the Nobel Committee great pleasure to extend to the Quartet’s representatives a warm welcome to this year’s Peace Prize award ceremony: Hassine Abassi, Secretary General of the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT), Mohamed Fadhel Mahfoudh, President of the Tunisian Order of Lawyers (ONAT), Abdessatar Ben Moussa, President of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH) and Ouided Bouchamaoui, President of the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts (UTICA). Aux quatre représentants du Quartet, Lauréat du Prix Nobel de la Paix, je dis – soyez les bienvenus à Oslo! The narrative underlying this year’s Peace Prize is a dramatic one. It speaks to the core of Alfred Nobel’s will and Nobel’s vision of fraternity, disarmament and peace-building forums. Not because the Quartet has actively sought to promote disarmament, but because its work has led to a better platform for peace and non-violent resolution of conflicts. This is a story about building strong institutions to ensure justice and stability, and demonstrating the will to engage in dialogue and cooperation.  This year’s prize is truly a prize for peace, awarded against a backdrop of unrest and war.  In the summer of 2013, Tunisia was on the brink of civil war. The Quartet’s resolute intervention helped to halt the spiralling violence and put developments on a peaceful track. Tunisia was spared the horrors of civil war and instead established a constitutional system of government guaranteeing fundamental rights for the entire population, regardless of gender, political conviction or religious belief.    Ladies and gentlemen, this is an admirable accomplishment, and indeed worthy of a Nobel prize!  The Quartet – receiving the Peace Prize as one entity, not as four organisations – represents different sectors and values in Tunisian society: working life, welfare, principles of the rule of law and human rights. This diversity gave the Quartet the moral authority to exercise its role as a mediator and driving force for peaceful democratic development in Tunisia. The Quartet has thus helped to lay the groundwork for national fraternity in the spirit of Alfred Nobel. The Committee hopes that this will serve as an example for other countries to follow, thereby fostering peace. We live in turbulent times. In North Africa, the Middle East and Europe, millions of people are fleeing from war, oppression, suffering and terror. The causes of the refugee crisis are numerous and complex, and there are no simple solutions. But one thing is indisputable: if every country had done as Tunisia has done, and paved the way for dialogue, tolerance, democracy and equal rights, far fewer people would have been forced to flee. Tunisia has shown the world that Islamist and secular political movements can negotiate with one another to reach solutions in the country’s best interests, if only they are willing to do so! But there are also forces, dark forces, which for that very reason do not want Tunisia to succeed – which see the emergence of democracy and equal rights for all, including women, in an Arab Muslim country as a threat to their own ambitions for power, and as irreconcilable with their own extremist mind-set. This poses major security challenges for Tunisia. Security measures, states of emergency and ideological battles alone cannot solve these challenges. Economic and political reforms, not least a sustained effort to combat corruption, are also needed. Let us take a closer look at the story behind this year’s prize, and see just what makes it a Peace Prize in the truest sense. The Arab Spring originated in Tunisia. To understand the causes of the uprising, it may help to quote the then 19-year-old Tunisian author Samar al-Mazghani, who shortly before the revolution described the paralysing hopelessness she felt in her home country under the Ben Ali dictatorship: “Here, we live with no dreams, or we dream with no life. … And our dreams are postponed until something happens to change this reality.” That something occurred just months later: on 17 December 2010, the 26-year-old fruit and vegetable seller Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire in a desperate protest against the corruption and misrule that prevailed in his home town of Sidi Bouzid.  The tragic incident sparked long-suppressed anger among the inhabitants of Sidi Bouzid. Social media communicated news of what had happened, and the rage spread, culminating in nation-wide protests and demonstrations. Four weeks later, President Ben Ali, Tunisia’s autocratic leader for many years, fled to Saudi Arabia. The dictator had experienced the truth of the old Tunisian saying, “The multitude is stronger than the king”.     However, events gradually took a turn that aroused concern in Tunisia. The government, spearheaded by the Islamist party Ennahda, tried to insert provisions into the new constitution that would have had negative consequences for the status of women in society. Even before the revolution, Tunisian women had enjoyed greater freedom than women in other Arab countries. Now they wanted full equality, not reduced rights. The situation gradually got worse. After two shocking political assassinations and the killing of eight Tunisian soldiers by terrorists, alongside large demonstrations against the government, many feared that the security situation was spiralling out of control. Peace was truly in jeopardy. It was at this critical moment that the Quartet was established. At the initiative of the Labour Union UGTT’s Secretary General Hassine Abassi, the four organisations presented a joint proposal for resolving the national crisis. Their plan was to convince the 21 political parties in the Constituent Assembly to participate in a national dialogue under the oversight of the Quartet. The national dialogue was to be an egalitarian, compromise-oriented process, in which everyone would have a say, and each party would have the same number of votes, regardless of its size.  More specifically, the Quartet required the parties to sign an agreement – known as the “road map” – comprising three main points: The sitting three-party government was to relinquish power. A non-partisan technocratic government was to be appointed to govern the country until new parliamentary elections were held. The Constituent Assembly of Tunisia was to complete its work by a specified deadline, and appoint an independent commission to prepare elections of a new parliament and a new president in the autumn of 2014. The government initially rejected the Quartet’s initiative, but after lengthy and difficult negotiations, the Quartet succeeded, slowly but surely, in bringing all the parties in Tunisia to the negotiation table. A decisive breakthrough was achieved when first two, and eventually all three, government parties agreed to step down as soon as the new constitution was adopted. With the road map in place, the Constituent Assembly completed its demanding task within the stipulated time limit and in close cooperation with the Quartet and the other parties to the national dialogue process. Tunisia’s new constitution was adopted on 26 January 2014. It is considered the most egalitarian and democratic constitution in the Arab world. In accordance with the road map, the Troika government resigned and was replaced by a caretaker government. With that, the Quartet had fulfilled its self-defined mandate, and could conclude its role as mediator. The ultimate validation of the Quartet’s historical effort came in the autumn of 2014, when the parliamentary and presidential elections were carried out. Both the technocratic government and the interim president resigned and were replaced by lawfully elected successors. Ladies and gentlemen, Tunisia’s path to democracy and rule of law since the Revolution of 2011 is remarkable for several reasons.  First: Cooperation across religious divisions. Although Ennahda and the secular parties often stood on opposing sides during the work on the new constitution, they were compelled by the national dialogue process to negotiate and reach compromises in the best interests of Tunisian society as a whole, not just their own supporters. This gave the main religious parties part-ownership of the emerging democracy and the new constitution they were helping to shape. Those who claim that Islam and democracy are incompatible, or that Islamic and secular parties cannot work together for the good of society, need only look to Tunisia. Second: The key role played by women. Women took the lead in the protests against political violence and against the attempts to introduce highly oppressive gender provisions in the new constitution. Without women’s participation, the fruits of the Revolution could easily have been lost. Women must have the same opportunities as men to influence developments at every level of society if genuine democracy and lasting peace are to be achieved. If there is anyone who still doubts that this goal is attainable in Muslim and Arab countries, let him or her look to Tunisia. Third: Peaceful transitions of power. Since the revolution in 2011 Tunisia has witnessed several shifts of government and presidents. Tunisian politicians and parties deserve credit for their willingness to accept the will of the people and the rules of democracy, even when this made it necessary for them to resign or step down in favour of their opponents.     Last, but not least: The crucial importance of civil society. When the constitutional process foundered and the government institutions and parties failed to resolve the political crisis, civil society organisations and representatives stepped in to assume national responsibility. There was no stronger symbol of this commitment than the National Dialogue Quartet. But it did not stand alone. Other organisations also contributed, each in its own way. We can truly say, therefore, that the peace, democracy and constitutional state we now see are the work of the Tunisian people. Dear Quartet, The Norwegian Nobel Committee is aware that Tunisia faces major challenges, and that a great deal of work remains to be done. We hope that the Peace Prize will help to ensure that there is no return to the Tunisia that existed before democracy, before the revolution. And we hope, moreover, that the laws and institutions that the national dialogue process has helped create will be a foundation for lasting stability and progress. Or as the British-Irish politician Edmund Burke once advised another people, after another historic revolution: “Make the Revolution a parent of settlement, and not a nursery of future revolutions.”    Tunisia’s security challenges are urgent. They are all too familiar to us. They resemble our own. They are our own. In this time of terror, the threats against Tunisia and the Tunisian people are indistinguishable from the threats against other countries. They are the same forces that broke the peace this autumn with acts of terrorism in so many places, including Beirut, Ankara, in the airspace over the Sinai peninsula, and in Paris, Bamako and Tunis, and that recently murdered a Norwegian, a Chinese and a Russian hostage in Syria. Because the threat is essentially the same to us all, we must stand together to combat it. For that very reason, this is the time to mobilise support for Tunisia and help to ensure that the democratisation process is continued and safeguarded. Among a great many other things, that means providing support for economic development and cooperation. The international community must assume its responsibility and invest in Tunisia. Ladies and gentlemen, One of the most important results of the national dialogue process is, without a doubt, the constitution of 26 January 2014. As I said earlier, it is the most democratic constitution in the entire Arab world. Members of the National Dialogue Quartet, it is easy for us Norwegians to appreciate the importance of this achievement. In the same year that you helped steer the constitutional process to a successful conclusion, the Norwegian people celebrated the 200th anniversary of their constitution. It was one of the most radical and democratic constitutions of its time, and we are still proud of it. It is the hope of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that, 200 years from now, the people of Tunisia will look back on the founding fathers and mothers of their constitution, including the National Dialogue Quartet, with the same sense of pride. In closing, I would like to share with you that the boy you see on this year’s Nobel diploma is intended by the artist to symbolise the uncertain future faced by young people today, especially all those who feel that they have no power or opportunity to influence it. This is a forceful, eloquent image. The expression on the young boy’s face reflects a cry for hope for the future, for the opportunity to be seen and heard, take part in society, use his skills and live in peace and security. We hope that this diploma will inspire the Quartet and all positive forces in Tunisia to continue their shared search for peaceful, forward-looking solutions, around the negotiation table, for the good of the nation.  And may the diploma remind us all of our obligation to the millions of children and young people who, while we are gathered here today, feel as if they are groping in the dark, with no hope or faith in the future. May these young people have the blindfold removed from their eyes and see a brighter future, a future in peace and freedom. Inspired by this vision, I would like to conclude with the words of an earlier Peace Prize laureate, Martin Luther King, Jr.: “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”"
"89","2016","Juan Manuel Santos"," NorwegianEnglishSpanish Berit Reiss-Andersen, deputy chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, delivering the Presentation Speech at the Nobel Peace Prize Award Ceremony. Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Mr. President, Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2016 to Colombia’s President Juan Manuel Santos for his resolute and courageous efforts to bring to an end the country’s more than 50-year-long civil war. The award has been made to President Santos alone. But it is also intended as a tribute to the Colombian people – a people who despite great hardships and countless injustices have never given up hope of a just peace. Many groups and individuals have contributed to the peace process and deserve our thanks and tribute today, including tireless negotiators, facilitators, diplomats, politicians and, of course, leaders from the government and the FARC guerrillas. Our tribute is paid, not least, to the representatives of the civil war’s victims, several of whom are present here today. They carry their own painful stories, yet manage to represent other victims as well. We salute all these strong, fearless individuals, and offer them our respectful gratitude. The armed conflict between the Colombian authorities, the FARC and ELN revolutionary guerrilla groups and various paramilitary groups is the longest civil war in our time. The human and material cost of the conflict is almost inconceivable and very difficult to measure. Numbers give only a vague, albeit horrifying, impression of the extent of the suffering and the war’s impact on daily life for several generations of Colombians. Since the first military confrontations in May 1964 and until the mutual ceasefire entered into force this summer, more than 222 000 Colombians have lost their lives as a direct consequence of the conflict. Four of every five persons killed were civilian non-combatants. In addition, somewhere between five and seven million Colombians were forced to flee their homes. Many have lived ever since as displaced persons in their own country. In 2013, an investigative report was presented by the Colombian National Center for Historical Memory. The report shows that nearly 2 000 massacres of civilians have taken place in Colombia since the early 1980s. Allegedly, more than 1 000 of these mass killings were carried out by paramilitary groups who fought the rebels, almost 350 by FARC or ELN guerrillas, and close to 300 by Colombian security forces. The rebel guerrillas, for their part, were responsible for a majority of the many kidnappings that terrorised the Colombian people from 1995 to 2005. In that decade an average of one kidnapping took place every eight hours. The guerrillas used the kidnappings and the ever-expanding drug trade to finance their warfare. Colombia has long been the world’s biggest producer of cocaine. The social and health effects of drug trafficking is a tragedy in its own right, with consequences far beyond Colombia’s borders. Now, at last, it looks as though this terrible conflict will soon be history. Mr. President, you initiated the negotiations that culminated in the peace accord between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrillas earlier this autumn. This was an initiative that required considerable political courage and great perseverance. The initiative was grounded in a conviction that negotiations were the only path to creating a better future for your people. After a narrow majority of voters opposed the accord in the referendum held on 2 October, you made it clear that you would in no way give up, but would pursue your efforts to end the civil war with undiminished vigour. Like many others, you realised that the Colombian people had not voted “No” to peace, but to the accord submitted to them. In this critical situation, you issued an invitation to participate in a broad-based national dialogue with a view to reaching an agreement that could also win the support of its critics. The accord has now been renegotiated. While the second agreement has also been subject to criticism, several contentious points in the first accord have been amended and the groundwork has been laid for a historic national compromise. You have been a driving force throughout this peace process. Mr. President, when the referendum results were announced, many observers felt that it would be premature to award you the Nobel Peace Prize this year. They recommended that the Norwegian Nobel Committee wait another year to see whether the peace process would eventually succeed in bringing about true peace. The Committee, however, saw things differently. In our view, there was no time to lose. On the contrary, the peace process was in danger of collapsing and needed all the international support it could get. Moreover, we were deeply convinced that you Mr. President, as Colombia’s head of state, were the one to continue to move the peace process forward. Developments in the weeks since the announcement of this year’s Peace Prize have in no way weakened our conviction in this respect. In awarding the Nobel Peace Prize for 2016 to President Juan Manuel Santos the Norwegian Nobel Committee sought to encourage him and all those working to achieve peace, reconciliation and justice in Colombia not to give up. Political compromises seldom strike a perfect balance. Peace accords are especially hard to balance. Nonetheless, it is our sincere hope that the renegotiated accord that has now been signed by the parties and ratified by the Congress is a solution that can ensure the Colombian people peace and positive development. Mr. President, after the referendum you emphasised that you would continue to work for peace until your very last day in office, “because that’s the way to leave a better country to our children”. Children under the age of 15 account for 23 per cent of Colombia’s population, or more than 11 million people. Kindling a spark of hope in the eyes of these 11 million children and their loved ones is the best possible investment towards a peaceful future for your people. Ladies and gentlemen, the history of the Nobel Peace Prize shows that there are many roads to peace. By awarding this year’s Peace Prize to President Juan Manuel Santos, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to honour him and all those who have helped stake out what can be called the Colombian road to peace. This road has three distinctive features that can serve to inspire similar processes in other countries. One is the will to face up to unpleasant, painful facts in order to lay the foundation for national reconciliation. For too long, victims’ memories of abuses, killings and other crimes were either a taboo — or a source of continuing conflict and enmity between the parties. The population’s growing desire for peace could never have been satisfied without breaking this vicious cycle. Two important steps in the right direction were taken with the establishment of Colombia’s National Center of Historical Memory and the publication in 2013 of the centre’s investigative report “Basta Ya!” – “Enough Already!” – which documented in detail the magnitude of the civil war’s atrocities. When you, Mr President, was presented with the report, you stated that it represented “a first window towards the truth that we owe to the victims of this country”. The second distinctive feature of the Colombian road to peace is the participation of the victims and their representatives. The negotiations between the government and the FARC were ground-breaking because they gave the victims’ representatives the opportunity to testify about their dreadful experiences in the presence of the parties concerned – and to confront perpetrators on all sides of the conflict. Inspired in part by South Africa’s peace and reconciliation process, the parties have recognised that a lasting peace arrangement must safeguard the rights and dignity of the victims while ensuring that the truth becomes known and that the perpetrators are held accountable and admit their guilt. In this connection, I wish to commend FARC guerrilla leader Rodrigo Londoño for so clearly, and unreservedly, expressing regret for the suffering that the FARC has inflicted on the civilian population and asking the Colombian people for forgiveness. This is an example to be followed. The third distinctive feature of this peace process is the fact that the parties have engaged critics of the process by inviting them to join in a broad-based national dialogue. This was particularly the case after the referendum, when President Santos reached out to those who had voted “No”. Simultaneously, the leader of the FARC gave assurance that the organisation would continue negotiating and “use only words as weapons to build towards the future”. I venture to believe that this means the national reconciliation process is already well underway. There is still, however, a long way to go. After more than 50 years of bitter conflict, true reconciliation does not happen overnight. Overcoming deep-seated distrust and a sense of exclusion is a huge task. We therefore encourage all sides in Colombia to carry on the national dialogue and continue on the road to reconciliation. Ladies and gentlemen, Alfred Nobel’s will refers to three different types of peace work that qualify for the Nobel Peace Prize: contributions to fraternity between nations, to the abolition or reduction of standing armies, or to the holding and promotion of peace congresses. All these forms of peace work are represented in this year’s Peace Prize. The peace process has already helped to foster fraternity between different parts of the population in Colombia. The civil war has also been a source of tension between Colombia and other countries in the region. Ending the civil war once and for all could strengthen fraternity not only in Colombia but also across national borders in the Americas. This year’s Peace Prize also pertains greatly to the abolition or reduction of standing armies – meaning disarmament and arms control. Around 7 000 FARC soldiers are to be disarmed. The surrender and destruction of the weapons will be overseen by the United Nations. Hopefully, a similar negotiated disarmament agreement with the ELN guerrilla will soon be in place as well. Even though the obtained disarmament so far applies primarily to the FARC guerrillas, it is the Committee’s hope that the peace accord will also enable the government to reduce its military expenditure and thereby release funds that can be spent on building peace and welfare in Colombia. And lastly, the long and intense talks that the Colombian government has held with the FARC guerrillas and the victims’ representatives, assisted by international facilitators such as Cuba and Norway, have in many ways served as a continual national peace congress. The award of the Peace Prize to President Santos thus absolutely fulfils the criteria and the spirit of Alfred Nobel’s will. The more than 50-year armed conflict in Colombia is complex, and the country faces a magnitude of problems that must be solved. This will take time, making it even more important to get to work quickly. Only when peace has been restored will it be possible to give priority to education and other important services to assure positive, sustainable development. It is the Norwegian Nobel Committee’s hope that, in the years to come, the Colombian people will be able to reap the benefits of the ongoing peace and reconciliation process so that the country can effectively address major challenges such as poverty, social injustice and drug-related crime. Mr. President, by awarding you this year’s Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wished to commend you on the results already achieved in the peace process. But it also sought to strengthen you and those around you in the difficult situation that arose after the referendum. It is with relief and satisfaction that we now note that your stated ambition of travelling to Oslo with a new peace accord in hand has been fulfilled. Perhaps the Nobel Peace Prize has contributed positively by giving you and the peace process a little push forward in these critical weeks. It is the Committee’s hope that it will also serve as an inspiration to all Colombians, as they now begin implementing the accord and building a just and lasting peace. Ladies and gentlemen, seeking forgiveness for atrocities and suffering on the scale we have seen in Colombia is asking a great deal. No one can demand that a victim forgive his or her assailant. But by opening up memories, by having victims and perpetrators alike tell their stories, a foundation is also laid for reconciliation. This is what philosophers have called “the work of memory”. It is a painful process, yet at the same time it is a process that makes it possible to leave the pain behind and join forces in building a better future. This year’s Peace Prize diploma, which is reproduced in the programme in front of you, addresses this very issue: “The motif may look like a kiss,” the artist Willibald Storn has said, “but for me this picture is about forgiveness.” In closing, I would like to quote another Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whose words bear direct relevance to the current situation in Colombia: “Forgiving and being reconciled to our enemies or our loved ones are not about pretending that things are other than they are. … True reconciliation exposes the awfulness, the abuse, the hurt, the truth. … It is a risky undertaking but in the end it is worthwhile, because in the end only an honest confrontation with reality can bring real healing.”"

Berit Reiss-Andersen, Chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, delivering the Presentation Speech at the Nobel Peace Prize Award Ceremony. Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Distinguished Representatives of the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2017. On behalf of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, I take great pleasure in congratulating ICAN on this award. ICAN is receiving the award for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons. ICAN’s efforts have given new momentum to the process of abolishing nuclear weapons. This year’s Peace Prize follows in a tradition of awards that have honoured efforts against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and for nuclear disarmament. Twelve Peace Prizes have been awarded, in whole or in part, for this type of peace work. The first went to Philip Noel-Baker in 1959, and the most recent was awarded to Barack Obama in 2009. And now, this year, to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN). On two days in August 1945, the world experienced the terrible destructive force of nuclear weapons for the first time. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki instantly killed at least 140,000 people, the vast majority of whom were civilians. Hiroshima was utterly destroyed and large sections of Nagasaki were laid in ruins. But death was not finished with Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The death toll continued to rise significantly in the years that followed, and survivors are still suffering from the effects of radiation today. The devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has taught us that nuclear weapons are so dangerous, and inflict so much agony and death on civilian populations, that they must never, ever, be used again. Today’s nuclear weapons are tremendously more destructive than the bombs that were dropped on Japan in 1945. A nuclear war could kill millions of people, dramatically alter the climate and the environment for much of the planet, and destabilise societies in a way never before seen by humanity. The notion of a limited nuclear war is an illusion. Nuclear weapons do not distinguish between military and civilian targets. Used in war, they would impact disproportionately on the civilian population, inflicting vast, unnecessary suffering. It is virtually impossible for civilians to protect themselves against the catastrophic effects of a nuclear attack. The use of nuclear weapons – or even the threat of using them – is therefore unacceptable on any grounds, whether humanitarian, moral or legal. Despite all this, it remains the case that the global balance of military power is maintained by nuclear weapons. The logic of this balance of terror rests on the proposition that nuclear weapons are such a deterrent that no one would dare attack a nuclear-armed state. The deterrent effect is said to be so strong that it alone has prevented war between the nuclear powers for the last 70 years. The empirical basis for this assumption is highly debatable. It cannot be claimed with any certainty that deterrence has worked as intended. It is also worth keeping in mind that nuclear deterrence requires a credible threat to actually use nuclear weapons. The weapons exist so that they can, if necessary, be deployed. A number of international agreements and treaties have been entered into which limit the possession and development of nuclear weapons. The most important of these is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT. It takes considerable military and political insight to fully understand all the treaties, agreements and international legal instruments that regulate disarmament and arms control. The views that dominate the political debate are those of the great powers and powerful alliances. ICAN arose as a protest against the established order. Nuclear weapon issues are not solely a question to be addressed by governments, nor a matter for experts or high-level politicians. Nuclear weapons concern everyone, and everyone is entitled to an opinion. ICAN has succeeded in generating fresh engagement among ordinary people in the campaign against nuclear weapons. The organisation’s acronym is perhaps not a coincidence: I CAN. ICAN’s main message is that the world can never be safe as long as we have nuclear weapons. This message resonates with millions of people who perceive that the threat of nuclear war is greater than it has been for a long time, not least due to the situation in North Korea. Another major concern of ICAN is that the current international legal order is inadequate to deal with the nuclear weapons problem. The entry into force of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1970 was a historic breakthrough. It gave formal status to the nuclear powers of the day – the United States, the Soviet Union, the UK, France and China – as states with the legal right to possess nuclear weapons. All other countries that acceded to the treaty pledged, in so doing, not to acquire such weapons. In return, the legally recognized nuclear-weapon states undertook to begin negotiations in good faith to seek nuclear disarmament. This dual pledge is the very core of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and both sides of it must be honoured to maintain the treaty’s legitimacy. Ladies and gentlemen, it is no exaggeration to say that the nuclear-weapon states have only to a limited degree honoured the disarmament commitment they made in the NPT. Let me remind you that in 2000 the NPT’s Review Conference stated that the treaty calls for “an unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon states to accomplish the total elimination of their arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament”. From an international law perspective, the five legally recognized nuclear-weapon states and their allies have thus assumed a responsibility to help achieve disarmament and a world free of nuclear weapons. If the disarmament process had been carried out as intended, ICAN’s struggle for a treaty-based ban on nuclear weapons would have been unneeded. It is the lack of progress towards nuclear disarmament that has made it necessary to supplement the Non-Proliferation Treaty with other international legal initiatives and commitments. The Non-Proliferation Treaty applies only to the countries that have acceded to it. India, Pakistan and Israel, which all have nuclear weapons, are not NPT members. Moreover, North Korea, which has carried out six nuclear test explosions, has withdrawn from the treaty. Global nuclear disarmament cannot take place without these countries, too, participating. Yet they reserve for themselves the same right to nuclear weapons as the five states that had acquired such weapons prior to 1970. The five legally recognized nuclear-weapon states, for their part, cite the nuclear arsenals of these other countries as one of several arguments for not yet being able to comply with the NPT’s nuclear disarmament requirements. It is in part to break this vicious cycle that ICAN has advocated a universal, treaty-based ban on nuclear weapons. ICAN does not accept that the lack of progress towards nuclear disarmament is a realpolitik necessity. ICAN’s premise is humanitarian, maintaining that any use of nuclear weapons will cause unacceptable human suffering. Binding international prohibitions have already been established for chemical weapons, biological weapons, land mines and cluster weapons, precisely because of the unacceptable harm and suffering that these weapons inflict on civilian populations. It defies common sense that nuclear weapons, which are far more dangerous, are not subject to a comparable ban under international law. Pointing out this legal gap was a crucial first step on the road to a prohibition treaty. Another important step was the Humanitarian Pledge initiated by the Austrian Government in December 2014. The Pledge is a voluntary national commitment to seek to stigmatise, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons. ICAN has worked resolutely to muster broad international support for the Humanitarian Pledge. To date, 127 states have signed on to this commitment. ICAN has also been a driving force in efforts to secure a binding international ban of nuclear weapons. On 7 July 2017, a final draft treaty was endorsed by 129 UN member states. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was opened for signature this autumn, and has been signed so far by 56 states. When 50 or more states have also ratified the treaty, it will become binding under international law for the signatory states. ICAN is a young organisation, founded in 2007 on the initiative of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985. ICAN is a loose coalition of 468 NGOs from more than 100 countries. It is impressive that ICAN is able to unite so many different groups in support of a common goal and give a voice to millions of people who are convinced that nuclear weapons do not provide security, but insecurity. In awarding this year’s Peace Prize to ICAN, the Norwegian Nobel Committee seeks to honour this remarkable endeavour to serve the interests of mankind. The Nobel Committee believes that an international ban on nuclear weapons will be an important, possibly decisive, step on the road to a world without nuclear weapons. Such a goal is fully consistent with the essence of Alfred Nobel’s will. Ladies and gentlemen, ICAN’s support for a global ban on nuclear weapons is not uncontroversial. We must acknowledge that the treaty has powerful opponents, but the idea of prohibiting and abolishing nuclear weapons is neither naïve nor new. As early as 1946, in the UN General Assembly’s very first resolution, the United Nations called for nuclear disarmament and an international nuclear weapons control regime. At the Reykjavik Summit in 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan tried to halt the spiralling nuclear arms race between the two superpowers, and came close to concluding an agreement to abolish all long-range nuclear missiles. A year and a half earlier, President Reagan had addressed the people of the United States and the Soviet Union directly, saying: “A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. The only value in our two nations possessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they never will be used. But then, would it not be better to do away with them entirely?” Today it is more important than ever to support this vision. While the global community may trust that no responsible head of state would ever order another nuclear attack, we have no guarantees that it will not happen. Despite international legal commitments, irresponsible leaders can come to power in any nuclear-armed state and become embroiled in serious military conflicts that veer out of control. Ultimately, nuclear weapons are controlled by human beings. In spite of advanced security mechanisms and control systems, technical and human errors can occur, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Can we be sure that the control systems of the nuclear powers will not someday be sabotaged by hackers acting on behalf of hostile states, terrorists or extremists? In short, nuclear weapons are so dangerous that the only responsible course of action is to work for their removal and destruction. Many people think that the vision of a nuclear weapon-free world, a Global Zero, is utopic, or even irresponsible. Similar arguments were once used to oppose the treaties banning biological and chemical weapons, cluster weapons and land mines. Nonetheless, the prohibitions became reality and most of these weapons are far less prevalent today as a result. Using them is taboo. Ladies and gentlemen, the Norwegian Nobel Committee is aware that nuclear weapons disarmament presents far greater challenges than disarmament of the types of weapons I just mentioned. But there is no getting around the fact that the nuclear weapon states have committed, through the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to work towards disarmament. This is the ultimate objective of the treaty. Through its efforts, ICAN has reminded the nuclear weapon states that their commitment entails a genuine obligation, and the time to honour it is now! In his Nobel lecture in 1959, Philip Noel-Baker took issue with the widely held opinion that complete nuclear disarmament is impossible to achieve in the real world. He quoted another Peace Prize laureate, Fridtjof Nansen: “The difficult is what takes a little while; the impossible is what takes a little longer.” The people of ICAN are impatient and visionary, but they are not naïve. ICAN recognizes that the nuclear-armed states cannot eliminate their nuclear weapons overnight. This must be achieved through a mutual, gradual and verifiable disarmament process. But it is the hope of ICAN and the Norwegian Nobel Committee that an international legal ban, and broad popular engagement, will put pressure on all nuclear-armed states and expedite the process. Ladies and gentlemen, there are two persons on the podium today who, each in their way, are outstanding representatives of the ICAN movement. Madam Setsuko Thurlow, you were 13 years old when you experienced the bombing of Hiroshima. You have devoted your life to bearing witness to the events of 6 August 1945. You see it as your mission to describe the suffering, fear and death inflicted on your city. No one was spared. Little children, their parents, brothers and sisters, schoolmates and grandparents were killed. You say that war cannot be waged in this way, and that it must never happen again. You do not allow us to forget. Beatrice Fihn, you are the Executive Director of ICAN and have the challenging task of uniting different organisations and interest groups in pursuit of a common goal. You are a splendid representative of the multitude of idealists who forgo an ordinary career and instead devote all of their time and skills to the work of achieving a peaceful world. It is an honour to have you here as our guests, and we wish to express our deep and heartfelt gratitude for the work that you do. Our tribute also goes to all the individuals and organisations that you represent. The decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2017 to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons has a solid grounding in Alfred Nobel’s will. The will specifies three different criteria for awarding the Peace Prize: the promotion of fraternity between nations, the advancement of disarmament and arms control and the holding and promotion of peace congresses. ICAN works vigorously to achieve nuclear disarmament. ICAN and a majority of UN member states have contributed to fraternity between nations by supporting the Humanitarian Pledge. And through its inspiring and innovative support for the UN negotiations on a Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty, ICAN has played an important role in bringing about what in our day and age is equivalent to an international peace congress. In closing, I would like to quote His Holiness Pope Francis, who recently declared: “Weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, create nothing but a false sense of security. They cannot constitute the basis for peaceful coexistence between members of the human family, which must rather be inspired by an ethics of solidarity.” The Norwegian Nobel Committee shares this view. Moreover, it is our firm conviction that ICAN, more than anyone else, has in the past year given the efforts to achieve a world without nuclear weapons a new direction and new vigour. Thank you."
"91","2018","Denis Mukwege, Nadia Murad"," NorwegianEnglishFrenchArabic (pdf) Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2018 to Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict. Their common struggle may be summed up in three simple statements: – Rape and other forms of sexual violence are unacceptable weapons in any and all warfare.
– Systematic rape as part of a military strategy in war or conflict is a war crime.
– Those responsible for war crimes must be punished, and the impunity they have enjoyed must end. This is the message shared by both Peace Prize laureates. The fight for justice unites them, despite their very different backgrounds. Denis Mukwege is a mature man and a Congolese. Nadia Murad is a young woman and Yazidi. Nonetheless, they are related to one another, just as they are related to every person who is a victim of abuse. They bring to mind the words of an earlier Peace Prize laureate, Tawakkol Karman of Yemen, whose prize also recognised the struggle for women’s rights. From this podium she said: “Injustice against one person is injustice against all mankind.” She, a Muslim Arab woman, invoked the battle waged by women in male-dominated societies, and described it as a fight for the dignity and rights of women and men alike. She dedicated her award “to all those women, whom history and the severity of ruling systems have made unseen, to all women who made sacrifices for the sake of a healthy society with just relationships between women and men, to all those women who are still stumbling on the path of freedom in countries with no social justice or equal opportunities”. Today’s Peace Prize laureates join a long tradition of champions of human dignity, carrying on the work of Tawakkol Karman and other Peace Prize laureates to highlight the struggle and oppression of women. It is the dream of ending oppression that brings us together on this occasion to honour two of the strongest voices in the world today. It is so appropriate that we are able to celebrate these two laureates on the exact date of the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a document that declares that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. Sexual abuse is also an abuse of these fundamental rights. The war waged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1997 has cost the lives of almost six million Congolese. Physician Denis Mukwege saw among his patients a growing number of women with severe injuries caused by rape and gross violence. Soldiers from all sides of the conflict have attacked young women. They have attacked old women. And they have attacked children. The point is to injure them and degrade them, but also to destabilise and demoralise the community in which they live. Gross sexual violence hurts the victim, hurts her family, and hurts her entire village and the larger community. A woman who has been raped by a group of 30 soldiers cannot simply put the experience behind her and continue her life as before. As a doctor, Denis Mukwege saw these women and the fact that they lacked health care and social support. He founded Panzi Hospital to meet the needs of the thousands of women victimised by these war crimes. Today he is one of the world’s foremost surgeons specialising in the repair of physical injuries caused by brutal, devastating rapes. However, Panzi Hospital also provides trauma treatment and programmes to reintegrate women into society. As a result of the sexual assaults, many of the women have lost their families and the support of their local communities. Without the efforts of Denis Mukwege and his staff at Panzi Hospital, these women would have been alone to fend for themselves. Denis Mukwege has helped these women as a physician, but he has also been a fervent advocate of their cause and their human dignity. His mission has been to tell the world of this abuse, to demand acknowledgement of the victims’ suffering and to insist the perpetrators be held accountable. Denis Mukwege has made enemies by unconditionally taking the victim’s side. He and his staff have endured threats, attempts on their lives and smear campaigns. In 2012, one of his bodyguards was killed in an attack targeting Dr. Mukwege and his family. For some people, defending the cause of women is clearly an intolerable offence. Denis Mukwege, we thank you for seeing the suffering and devoting your life to the battle for women and against sexual violence. Nadia Murad grew up in the Yazidi village of Kocho. She had a good life with her large family, dreaming, like many girls, of an education, but also of make-up and clothes. All her dreams were shattered, however, when war came to Kocho. In 2014, ISIS launched a campaign to gain control of northern Iraq and exterminate the Yazidi minority. Nadia Murad’s mother and six of her brothers were brutally killed. Young women and girls were spared, but another brutal fate awaited them. They were taken prisoner by ISIS and transported to the city of Mosul to be used as sex slaves. Each woman was a piece of property, an object that could be bought at the slave market, then used, discarded, sold or given away as a gift. The women were supposed to be circulated among many men. They were supposed to be treated brutally and humiliated, with the aim of breaking them down completely. The ultimate goal was the extermination of the Yazidi people. As ISIS saw it, the men had to be killed and the women so damaged that they became social outcasts. The most effective way of destroying a community is apparently to destroy the women. It is beyond comprehension that the extermination of an ethnic group and the commission of atrocities against individuals can be rationalised by a religious belief. Nadia Murad is a victim of war crimes and has experienced brutality and abuse of the most horrific kind. In her autobiography, she has described her shock, pain, fear and sense of debasement. At times she wanted to give up, but she preserved an innate ability to resist and was never cowed. Managing to escape as she did was in itself a great feat. But today she is receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for her activities subsequent to her time in ISIS captivity. She has defied the social codes of shame and silence, and dared to speak up on the abuses perpetrated against herself and thousands of Yazidi women and children. In doing so, she has broken a stigma that has afflicted millions of women victims of wartime sexual violence. She has dedicated her life to bearing witness to war crimes and making sure that the world does not forget. Nadia Murad, we thank you for your extraordinary courage. Ladies and gentlemen, both Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad have made significant contributions to combating this type of war crime by focusing attention on the suffering inflicted on women in Iraq, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and everywhere else in the world where sexual violence is used as a weapon. We must be aware of these crimes if we are to combat them. The war waged on women through the use of sexual violence has been a hidden war. When the time has come for peace negotiations and transitional justice, these crimes have rarely been on the agenda. The UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura, so accurately stated: “Sexual violence in conflict needs to be treated as the war crime that it is; it can no longer be written off or treated as an unfortunate collateral damage of war …” Ladies and gentlemen, our understanding of the particularly vulnerable position of women in war has evolved. It is an old problem, but the will to establish legal protections for women is relatively new. The Rome Statute of 1998 is the legal basis for the International Criminal Court and defines acts such as rape and sexual slavery as war crimes when these acts are committed as part of a systematic attack on the civilian population. The same principles were applied by the tribunals that dealt with war crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia (ICTR and ICTY). These tribunals also handed down judgments against persons who initiated systematic rape as part of a widespread attack against civilians. The United Nations Security Council followed up by adopting Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security in 2000. Security Council Resolution 1820 from 2008 goes a step further, establishing that sexual violence against women in war and conflict is a threat to international peace and security. It is important that international bodies set such legal and political standards but it is our common duty to live up to them. Denis Mukwege is spot on when he says: “Justice is everyone’s business.” Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad have both made significant efforts to advance this process. Both have been able to communicate the scale of the atrocities and to demand prosecution of all those responsible. They have thereby fulfilled key criteria in Alfred Nobel’s will. Their work is, in fact, a contribution to disarmament. Sexual violence is an intolerable weapon that cannot be accepted in warfare. Their primary contribution, however, is to what Alfred Nobel called the “fraternity of nations”: they have shown us that human suffering in war is universal. They have pointed out that women are predominantly invisible victims of the horrors of war. Both laureates have demanded that injustice be combated with justice. War crimes must be punished, and the responsibility rests with the entire international community. Both of them are thus fully deserving of Alfred Nobel’s Peace Prize. Ladies and gentlemen, this award obligates Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad to continue their vital work. But the award also obligates us to stand side by side with them in the struggle to end wartime sexual violence. Only then can the hopeful message of Nadia’s autobiography The Last Girl come true. Together we must make her generation of young women and girls the last generation to suffer from the barbarism of sexual war crimes."
"92","2019","Abiy Ahmed Ali"," Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Distinguished Representatives of the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2019 to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Prime Minister Abiy, the award bestowed upon you today rests on three major achievements. First, your crucial role in creating peace between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Second, your efforts to build democracy in Ethiopia by strengthening civil liberties and developing institutions. And third, but not least, the award is given to you for your contribution to peace and reconciliation processes in East and North East Africa. For almost three decades, there has been serious discord between Eritrea and Ethiopia, at times even full war between the two countries. The hostilities have involved land disputes, military clashes along your common borders, and a permanent breach in diplomatic and political relations. Since 2002 it has developed into what has become known as a “no peace, no war” situation. Prime Minister Abiy, you have been called the man of the moment, since during your first days in office as Prime Minister, you recognized the impetus which the transitional moment gave you and swiftly addressed the deadlocked situation. You seized the initiative and were the main architect behind the peace negotiations that were successfully conducted with Eritrea. However, without the positive response from President Isaias Afwerki, the conclusion of the two peace treaties would not have been possible. This has brought several significant changes. The two nations of Eritrea and Ethiopia have in fact declared peace. That in itself is a major step forward. The peoples of the two countries are increasingly able to travel and reunite. Border disputes have been settled and demarcation lines have been drawn up in accordance with the arbitration ruling of an international boundary commission back in 2002. Political and diplomatic relations have been restored. However, much work remains to fully implement all the intentions of the peace agreements. Several important border crossings remain closed, and the peoples of Eritrea and Ethiopia therefore have limited access to one another. The peace agreements also incorporate ambitions of social, cultural and economic development. At present, this work seems to be at a stand-still. It is the hope of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that your previous achievements, coupled with the added encouragement of the Peace Prize, will spur the parties to further implementation of the peace treaties. Dr. Abiy Ahmed, you were appointed Prime Minister in a country facing a multitude of challenges. Regional and ethnic divides have resulted in approximately three million internally displaced persons. These people are homeless within their own country and desperately need to return to their communities. You are also confronted with the daunting tasks of stimulating economic development, battling unemployment and improving education, health care and infrastructure. All of these tasks are critical building blocks in the process of constructing peace. The concept of peace must incorporate social justice and material improvement that will benefit all people. During your first 100 days as Prime Minister you took several firm initiatives to promote peace and democratic reform in your country. A strong statement was made when you appointed women to 50 per cent of the ministerial posts in your cabinet. As a woman myself, I would say that this is a wise move.  An equally wise move was the appointment of the world’s second Minister of Peace – another woman, naturally, Mrs. Muferihat Kamil, who is present here today. Even the President of Ethiopia is now a woman, in addition to which you have appointed a female Supreme Court Chief Justice. Mr. Prime Minister, lifting the existing state of emergency was a matter of urgency for you. You granted amnesty to thousands of political prisoners, thereby acknowledging that opposition is part of a healthy political environment. Knowing that free speech is a cornerstone of democracy, you abolished public censorship and thereby enabled the development of a free and independent press. You have strengthened civil society by taking a strong stance against corruption and bribery in the public sector. You have declared a commitment to hold free and democratic elections, which are prerequisites for a true democracy. The Norwegian Nobel Committee stands behind you and supports your efforts for a democratic, peaceful society. In recognizing your work by awarding you the Nobel Peace Prize, we were not expressing an opinion on how, or if, you should lead the Ethiopian people in the future. The leadership of Ethiopia and its political platform must be decided by the Ethiopian people and the Ethiopian people alone. Our award is based on the will of Alfred Nobel, and we recognize your endeavours as being in the true spirit of that will. You have chosen a path that we believe will consolidate peace and prosperity in your country. Dr. Abiy Ahmed, we are aware that in the course of your life you have walked several different paths. You were born into a traditional family of simple means, to a mother who was an Amhara Orthodox Christian and a father who was an Oromo Muslim. Diversity seems to be part of your origin. As an adult you have had a long military career, including participation in a United Nations peacekeeping operation in Rwanda. Before permanently entering Ethiopian politics, you held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. On top of that, you have been able to complete your PhD at the Institute of Peace and Security Studies at the University of Addis Ababa. Permit me to also add a personal trait to your list of merits: your profound humility – you rarely speak publicly of your achievements and success. The complexity of your background has made you well suited for the third task encompassed in our acknowledgement of your achievements today, namely, your work for peace and reconciliation in the East Africa region. You have put yourself at the disposal of your neighbours in the region to mediate disputes and conflicts. In Sudan you have mediated between the military regime and the civil opposition to find a transitional solution in the aftermath of Omar al- Bashir’s leadership. Your efforts have been much appreciated by the parties involved, and have resulted in the signing of a Draft Constitutional Declaration, which aims at ensuring a smooth transition to civil rule. You have also been engaged in peace and reconciliation talks in South Sudan, and have been willing to address the very real need of both Sudan and South Sudan to find and revitalize peaceful solutions to the great troubles that have afflicted their countries. Additionally, you have sought to mediate between Kenya and Somalia in their protracted conflict over rights to a disputed marine area. There is now hope for a resolution to this conflict. Finally, you have made crucial contributions to normalizing the diplomatic and political relationship between Djibouti and Eritrea. You have demonstrated an understanding that peace among neighbours is essential in a troubled region. You have made common cause with all the stakeholders from Eritrea, Djibouti, Sudan, South Sudan and Kenya who have participated in promoting mediation and peaceful resolution. You represent a new generation of African leaders who realize that armed conflict and ethnic hostilities must be resolved by peaceful means.  This year’s Peace Prize is a recognition of all the efforts made by all the nations and individuals involved. They say that good news rarely arrives from the Horn of Africa. Historically, good news did in fact come from Africa. Ethiopia is the cradle of humankind. The first Homo sapiens emigrated from the territory of your country. In this sense we are all Ethiopians. Your country has a unique history also within an African context, since it was never colonialized by any Western power. It is in part for this very reason that Ethiopia is home to the African Union. The good news of today is your endeavours to establish a new order of peace initiatives, openness and peaceful mediation to find new solutions to old disputes. The Norwegian Nobel Committee fully understands that peace is created in cooperation with others. We are awarding the Peace Prize to you as an individual because you have personally made an extraordinary difference across several arenas. It is the totality of your efforts that convinced us that it is you, Mr. Prime Minister, who have made the most significant contribution to peace in the past year. In phrasing my statement this way, I am in fact quoting the terms of the will of Alfred Nobel. You have also fulfilled another requirement of his will, namely to strengthen fraternity, both between peoples and between nations. The first African to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, Albert Luthuli, eloquently expressed the vision of the Peace Prize in his acceptance speech here in Oslo, on 10 December 1961. Speaking as a minister of the church shortly before the Christmas holidays, he said: “May the day come soon, when the people of the world will rouse themselves, and together effectively stamp out any threat to peace in whatever quarter of the world it may be found. When that day comes, there shall be “peace on earth and goodwill amongst men”, as was announced by the Angels …” Albert Luthuli’s vision probably exceeded even Alfred Nobel’s imagination. But we can use it as an ideal and inspiration to create more justice, more fraternity and more peace. If we are to achieve that goal, we must get to work. That is exactly the job you have taken upon yourself, Mr. Prime Minister. Thank you.  "
