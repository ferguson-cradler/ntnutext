 on_behalf of the nobel_committee bjørnstjerne_bjørnson introduced the speaker baroness bertha_von suttner to the audience in a few words he recalled the great influence of the baroness on the growth of the peace movement while still young she had had the audacity to oppose the horrors of war1 and had done so in one of the most militaristic countries in europe she had continued this fight all her life and never wearied of crying down with arms 2 despite the laughter with which her words had been greeted in the beginning they did receive a hearing because they were uttered by a person of noble character and because they proclaimed humanity's greatest cause many women had since followed in her footsteps and taken up the cause and the call to lay down arms had become general moreover to all men of goodwill the cause of peace and the women's cause were one and the same movement striving for the same goal when the cause of peace prevailed then too would the women's cause be won history constantly demonstrates the great influence of women women have encouraged the ideas of war the attitude to life and the causes for which men have fought for which their sons were brought up and of which they have dreamed any change or reformation of these ideas must be brought about chiefly by women the human ideal of manly courage and manly deeds must become more enlightened the faithful worker in all spiritual and material spheres of life must displace the bloodstained hero as the true ideal women will cooperate to give men higher aims to give their sons nobler dreams many are the individual women who have set an example in sacrifice and work who have followed the armies as angels of consolation and healing tending the sick and suffering how much more effective it is to do one's utmost to prevent misfortune this is where you madame baroness have taken the lead among women of today you have attacked war itself and cried to the nations down with arms this call will be your eternal honor beginning as a murmur in the corn on a summer's day and growing to a gale through the tops of the forest till the ocean bears it on with tenderous voice and nothing is heard but this 1 these stirring words of our great poet apply to your call to action madame baroness it began as a murmur through the lovely meadow of the danube valley2 that old highway for the devastating armies of war we already hear it in the forests in all parts of the world and soon we hope its voice borne by the oceans of people will permanently drown the sound of war drums and trumpets this will take a long time some will say we do not know and it makes no difference to our work our task is clear to combat any act of violence any war of aggression and so render even the justifiable defensive war unnecessary we shall rouse the conscience of man put justice and morality in the place of war we thank_you madame baroness for your firm faith for your hope and self sacrifice for your work we too in the lands of the north women as well as men need you to light and nourish the flame of faith and work good luck to you frédèric passy that venerable apostle of peace3 has called you madame baroness our general in chief the friends of peace in scandinavia applaud this salute as the nobel_committee meets today the tenth of december perhaps for the last time in this hall1 to announce to the norwegian_parliament its decision concerning the award of the peace_prize it is appropriate to recall that the norwegian_parliament was one of the first national assemblies to adopt and to support the cause of peace twelve or fifteen years_ago gentlemen the cause of peace presented a very different aspect from the one it presents today the cause was then regarded as a utopian idea and its advocates as well meaning but overly enthusiastic idealists who had no place in practical politics being out of touch with the realities of life the situation has altered radically since then for in recent_years leading statesmen even heads of state have espoused the cause which has now acquired a totally different image in public_opinion the united_states of america was among the first to infuse the ideal of peace into practical politics peace and arbitration treaties have now been concluded between the united_states and the governments of several countries but what has especially directed the attention of the friends of peace and of the whole civilized world to the united_states is president roosevelt's happy role in bringing to an end the bloody war recently waged between two of the world's great_powers japan and russia2 on_behalf of the norwegian_parliament i now present to you mr ambassador the peace_prize along with its insignia and i add the request that you convey to the president the greetings of the norwegian people and their gratitude for all that he has done in the cause of peace i would also add the wish that this eminent and highly gifted man may be blessed with the opportunity of continuing his work to strengthen the ideal of peace and to secure the peace of the world 1 the hall in which the norwegian_parliament customarily met mr knudsen anticipates no_doubt that future sessions for this purpose would be held in the norwegian_nobel institute which had recently been constructed 2 russo japanese war 1904 1905 the laureate offered his good offices to mediate the dispute the result was the treaty of portsmouth signed by russia and japan on september 5 1905 at portsmouth n.h u.s.a ernesto teodoro moneta was born in milan in 1833 at the age of

has been a member of the commission of the international peace bureau since 1895 with his prominent position in the italian press he has enjoyed excellent opportunities to promote his views special

conference in geneva in 1906 for the revision of the 1864 geneva convention2 and last but not least the two international peace conferences at the hague in 1899 and 1907 at all these conferences louis renault has played an outstanding part as a rule he has been the rapporteur of the meeting and as such has drafted reports and recommendations consequently he has had a decisive influence upon the agreements and the form they took at the hague peace conference in 1899 renault was reporter for the commission working on the problem of applying the provisions of the geneva_convention to naval warfare and for the drafting committee which drew up the final act of the conference renault's participation in the peace conference at the hague3 was even more important he was spokesman on the following problems 1 opening of hostilities 2 application of the geneva_convention to naval warfare 3 obligations and rights of neutral countries in the case of naval warfare 4 the international prize court of appeal the last two in particular are of far_reaching importance as well as of extremely delicate nature renault was also chairman and spokesman of the drafting committee of the conference and as such had enormous influence upon the final wording of the conventions by the outstanding part he played in the debates probably greater than that of any other member he also made his mark on the work of the conference as a whole the president of the conference mr nelidov4 described renault as its principal worker and on one occasion said that his dictionary had run out of words of praise

decided to divide the peace_prize between former member of the swedish parliament k.p arnoldson and former member of the danish parliament fredrik bajer it is a great pleasure for the committee to award the prize to these gentlemen since it is convinced that its choice accords with the general desire in the scandinavian countries they have both been untiring advocates of the ideals of peace k.p arnoldson was born in gothenburg in 1844 and in his youth was in the service of the swedish railways at the same_time however he also worked for the press as a journalist and author one of his

the same year arnoldson helped to found the swedish peace and arbitration association svenska freds och skiljedomsföreningen which recently celebrated its twenty fifth anniversary arnoldson was secretary of the association for the first few years and edited its paper arnoldson's work also extended to norway the success of his speeches in several of our cities in 1889 and 1890 indirectly

union he has always shown a great interest in cooperation between the nordic countries in the cause of peace he has invariably taken part in the nordic peace meetings and it is mainly due to his

international_law association each of these men mr beernaert and baron d'estournelles_de constant holds a prominent position in the international movement for peace and arbitration and it is therefore fully in keeping with the spirit of nobel's intentions that the prize should be awarded to them 1 according to all sources checked beernaert was born in 1829 2 according to all sources checked 1874 3 according to all sources checked 1873 4 leopold ii 1835 1909 king of belgium 1865 1909 see biography of beernaert paul henri benjamin d'estournelles_de constant is still in the prime of life born on

practical result of his efforts was the arbitration treaties between france and other countries and he saw his policy adopted beyond the frontiers of france he believed that foreign_policy should be controlled by parliaments and that consequently parliamentary arbitration groups should be developed and strengthened his work for peace has not been performed blindly as a diplomat he has learned to understand international policy and has planned his efforts accordingly in this country d'estournelles_de constant is a well_known and very welcome visitor ever_since the last visit of the french parliamentarians4 1 according to all sources checked d'estournelles was born on november 22 1852 2 published in 1891 the book won a prize from the french academy 3 in 1893 during french siamese border disputes the siamese under chulalongkorn rama v 1868 1910 fired at gunboats sent to enforce french demands a french ultimatum rejected by the siamese was followed by a blockade which in turn brought opposition from the british who refused to remove a gunboat stationed at bangkok to protect british subjects the crisis brief but acute ended when the siamese were obliged to accept the ultimatum and the blockade was raised 4 the laureate was an advocate and organizer of reciprocal visits between parliamentary groups of the various nations his own group had just visited norway in the preceding summer chairman of the committee løvland then announced that the peace_prize for this year had been awarded to the permanent peace bureau in bern he then briefly reviewed the peace movement in europe which as we all know has made steady headway since the great napoleonic wars the idea had earlier been championed by men like kant1 and rousseau2 first attempts were made to form organizations in america and in england the cause was supported by garibaldi3 and his comrades in arms and by the writer victor hugo4 the permanent international peace bureau bureau international permanent de_la paix was founded in 1891 with its headquarters in bern it was clear from the annual peace congresses that a central office was needed to act as a link between the peace societies of the various countries and in particular to help the local congress committees to organize the world rallies to make the bureau a legally constituted body empowered to receive donations and legacies it was made the agency of a society société du bureau international permanent de_la paix in accordance_with swiss law admission to membership is open to any institution association or individual upon a simple declaration of agreement with the objectives of the society the bureau is now under the control of a commission of thirty five members from the various countries under a president at the present time belgian senator henri la_fontaine three members must live in bern where the offices of the bureau are situated and supervised by an honorary secretary_general nobel prizewinner élie ducommun held this office from the time of the bureau's founding until his death in 1906 a period during which he rendered most valuable services to the organization the present secretary_general is nobel prizewinner dr gobat member of the swiss federal council both men have worked without compensation the economic position of the peace bureau has been difficult in addition to the interest on a capital of about 40,000 francs it has for some years received smaller fixed annual grants from switzerland denmark sweden and norway with some private contributions it has about 8,000 francs per annum most of this is spent on the publication of the journal correspondance bimensuelle which gives news of the peace movement and lists new literature on the subject of peace the bureau issues a yearbook annuaire du mouvement pacifiste with valuable information and papers on international affairs institutions and personalities since 1894 the bureau has had an affiliated american office in washington it is the function of the bern bureau to facilitate communications between the societies and individuals and to collect information on the peace movement it has a record office and a library it also prepares the questions to be put before the annual world peace congresses and implements the decisions of the congresses it has long been the common wish of all those in the peace movement throughout the world that the bureau be awarded the peace_prize the world peace congress in munich in 1908 directed a general request to all those entitled to make nominations to name the bureau the nobel_committee has also received recommendations from among others the swedish and danish peace unions we are convinced that this award is entirely in the spirit of alfred_nobel's plan he wanted his money to be used to support accelerate and promote the peace movement we firmly hope and expect that this_year's prize will further this aim and that the fruits of the award will be harvested in the years to come the nobel lecture usually delivered by the prizewinner was not given in this case 1 immanuel kant 1724 1804 german philosopher wrote on perpetual peace 1795 2 jean jacques rousseau 1712 1778 french philosopher wrote the social contract 1762 outlining the political principles of a governmental utopia 3 giuseppe garibaldi 1807 1882 italian patriot and soldier supported mostly by personal correspondence and letters to the press an international court of justice a united_states of europe free education and other plans to promote international understanding 4 victor hugo 1802 1885 french author was associated with peace movements in the mid 19th century for example he chaired the peace congress held in paris in 1849 and in his welcoming speech made his famous allusion to the united_states of europe tobias michael carel asser was born in 1838 in amsterdam where he became professor of commercial law and later of international_law from 1862 to 1893 when he was named a member of the council of state he soon became legal counselor to the dutch foreign office and in 1904 minister of state he holds honorary doctorates from the universities of cambridge edinburgh and bologna he was a dutch delegate at the two peace conferences at the hague1 and among other_things arbitrator in the dispute between russia and the u.s.a on the bering straits which he heard in 19022 and in the dispute between the u.s.a and mexico on the pious fund of the californias which was brought to the arbitration court at the hague 1902 3 he was one of the founders of the institut de droit international 1873 4 and has been one of its most active and influential members asser has above_all been a practical legal statesman he holds a position in the sphere of international private law similar to that enjoyed by the famous french jurist louis renault5 in international public law indeed his public activity has overshadowed his scholarly writing which is of great importance in its own right as a pioneer in the field of international legal relations he has earned a reputation as one of the leaders in modem jurisprudence it is therefore only natural that his countrymen should see him as a successor to or reviver of the netherlands pioneer work in international_law in the seventeenth century6 it was at his instigation that the dutch government summoned the four conferences at the hague in 1893 1894 1900 and 1904 on international private law all presided_over by asser they prepared the ground for conventions which would establish uniformity in international private law and thus lead to greater public security and justice in international relations the responsibility then passed to individual countries to bring their national legislation into line asser has also proposed that other nations follow the netherlands example by appointing permanent commissions to prepare the work of the conferences by doing this he said in 1900 the foundations will be laid for an international organization which without interfering with the complete autonomy of the nations in the domain of legislation would contribute greatly to the codification of international civil law within the not too distant future as a result of these conferences seven conventions have been concluded on different aspects of civil procedure legal aid and of family law five of these have been subscribed to by norway alfred hermann fried was born in vienna in 1864 but most of his activities have been carried on in germany since 1891 he has devoted his whole life to work for peace one of the few men to do so fried who was first a bookseller and then a journalist is a self educated man who with true german persistence and application worked his way up until he had mastered scholarly writing he has probably been the most industrious literary pacifist in the past twenty_years in 1892 he founded the deutsche friedensgesellschaft german peace society and for a time edited its journals since 1899 he has been publishing his own monthly periodical die friederswarte1 which he has gradually turned into the best journal in the peace movement with excellent leading articles and news of topical international problems fried has considered it his task to win over the german university faculties of international_law and history to the cause of peace and to persuade them to contribute to his periodical and he may now be said to have succeeded among the many who have lent their support to fried's candidacy for the nobel peace_prize are professors l von bar lamprecht niemeyer schucking rehm and lentner2 fried's name was also proposed by the swedish parliamentary peace group through baron bonde and by the swedish peace and arbitration association through another member of parliament according to fried the foundation of the peace movement should be the legal and political organization of international life he finds the beginnings of an efficient organization in the existing international bureaus and wants new ones to be created for all fields of international relations the existing international anarchy armed peace will gradually disappear with increased organization and be succeeded by an ordered state of peace because of this viewpoint fried places less emphasis on combating war the method generally employed by friends of peace that of arousing disgust at the idea of war is not in his opinion sufficient instead of fighting the symptoms of war he wants first and foremost to fight its cause namely the anarchy in international relations fried has argued his theory in a work entitled the basis of pacifism3 freiburg 1908 in addition to innumerable contributions to the austro german press fried has published a large number of individual monographs and books on pacifism among these are das abrüstungs problem berlin 1904 der kranke krieg leipzig 1909 a collection of his best leading articles in die friedenswarte and pan amerika berlin 1910 a meritorious scholarly account of the efforts organized by the pan_american bureau4 in washington his best known work is his handbuch der friedensbewegung 1905 of which part i came out this year in a new and expanded edition it is an account of the fundamental problems of the peace movement giving reports on peace conferences and the position of arbitration and containing an interesting historical review of the peace movement with biographies of outstanding friends of peace and a list of societies and other organizations belonging to the movement fried's agitation played a part in bringing about the morocco pact5 1 this replaced die waffen nieder published by fried and edited by bertha_von suttner 2 all of these were scholars and experts in law particularly international_law or in history and political science 3 the original german title was die grundlagen des revolutionären pacifismus tübingen mohr 1908 later editions were entitled die grundlagen des ursächlichen pazifismus 4 the international bureau of american_republics became the pan_american union in 1910 today it serves as the secretariat of the organization of american states oas formed in 1948 5 the latest of several moroccan crises brought on by european rivalry especially between germany and france for territorial power in morocco had just been settled by the convention of november 4 1911 which provided that germany would allow france a free hand in morocco in exchange for part of the french congo elihu root was born on february 15 1845 in the state of new_york and took his degree in law at new_york university in 1867 at a later date he studied international_law and took his doctorate1 in 1894 for some years he practiced as an attorney in new_york becoming one of the best in the profession in august 1899 he was appointed secretary of war by president mckinley and held that office until 1904 in the following year roosevelt persuaded him to take over the state department where he remained until his election to the senate in 1909 root is a man of engaging personality who has tried with determination and independence to put his ideals into_practice in the ten_years during which he held office as secretary of war and secretary of state he had to settle a number of particularly difficult problems some of an international character it was he who was chiefly responsible for organizing affairs in cuba and in the philippines after the spanish american war2 even more important was his work in bringing about better understanding between the countries of north and south america when he visited south america in the summer of 1906 he did a great_deal to strengthen the pan_american movement and in 1908 he founded the pan_american bureau in new york3 his strenuous efforts to improve relations_between the small central american countries have borne splendid fruit the most difficult problem with which root had to deal while secretary of state however was the dispute with japan over the status of japanese immigrants although a final solution of this dispute eluded him his work4 on it was nevertheless of great value after he had left the government root gave himself heart and soul to the cause of peace and he is now president of the great carnegie peace foundation5 as a senator root was one of the most energetic champions of taft's proposal for an unconditional arbitration treaty between the u.s.a and great_britain and in the dispute concerning tolls for the panama canal he supported the english interpretation of the hay pauncefote treaty opposing special privileges for american shipping6 when he spoke on this in the senate last spring he gained the admiration of all friends of peace 1 it seems likely that this refers not to a degree resulting from formal study but to the honorary degree of ll d conferred upon the laureate in 1894 by hamilton college 2 1898 3 washington d.c rather_than new_york would be correct here if as seems probable the reference is to the laureate's part in the 1908 cornerstone ceremonies for the pan_american building which thereafter housed the bureau root had proposed the building and had solicited the money for it from andrew carnegie 4 the so_called gentlemen's agreement negotiated by root in 1908 was superseded by the immigration bill of 1924 5 founded by andrew carnegie 1835 1919 american industrialist in 1910 with a gift of 10,000,000 6 the hay pauncefote treaty 1901 between the u.s and great_britain provided that the panama canal be open to all nations on equal terms the u.s panama canal act passed in 1912 and repealed in 1914 exempted u.s ships from tolls henri la_fontaine is the true leader of the popular peace movement in europe since 1907 he has been president of the international peace bureau in bern he is also a prominent member of the interparliamentary union1 la_fontaine was born on april 22 1854 in brussels where he is counsel at the court of appeal and a professor of international_law he entered the senate in 1895 and has been working for the cause of peace since 1889 la_fontaine is also a member of the brussels city council a member sponsored by the socialist party he is one of the best informed men working for peace and his initiative and energy have done much to promote the international peace movement particularly in the interparliamentary and peace conferences of recent_years where he has contributed to the practical organization of the movement and to the framing of international_law in 1899 for example his activities included participation in a peace congress in oslo in 1895 he founded the international institute of bibliography and later the central office of international associations2 la_fontaine has also been very active in the literary field an example being his great documentary work on arbitration cases from 1794 to 19003 there is no one who has contributed more to the organization of peaceful internationalism and his outstanding talent for administration has been invaluable to the peace movement la_fontaine belongs to the moderate wing of the socialist party he is the first social democrat to receive the nobel peace_prize the laureate did not deliver a nobel lecture 1 in effect founded in 1888 but formally constituted in 1889 the union is composed of parliamentarians from the various nations who discuss problems of international relations and law and of peace promoting their solution through governmental channels at this time it was primarily interested in encouraging arbitration of international disputes 2 the creation of both the institute in 1895 and the central office twelve years later must be credited to the initiative of two belgian internationalists la_fontaine and his friend paul otlet 3 pasicrisie internationale histoire documentaire des

nansen during these past years has brought him the peace_prize i might especially mention his work in the repatriation of prisoners of war his work for the russian refugees his work in aiding the millions in russia struggling against famine and now his work for the refugees in asia minor and thrace although this activity has been in progress for only a few years its extent and significance are such that the nobel_committee has felt it worthy of the great distinction of the nobel peace_prize those of us who have remained at home following events only through the newspapers have had but isolated glimpses of all this we have seen how great international tasks have again and again been entrusted to nansen we have seen him appear as the high_commissioner of the league of nations1 its representative and plenipotentiary we have seen him negotiating with representatives of nearly every country in europe or with agencies created under his administration we see him incessantly on the move one day we read in a cable that he is having talks with lloyd george2 in london then we suddenly learn that he has gone to rome for a conference with the pope next he is in russia to study the famine at first hand and to negotiate with the soviet government typhus claims some of his closest collaborators but he himself as so often before emerges safe and sound from the danger another day he is to be found in the league of nations assembly in geneva pleading the cause of humanity in the face of all political prejudices then he is off once more on his travels most recently to constantinople and greece until he now stands for a moment among us in his homeland to receive the peace_prize awarded to him without his even having been aware of his candidacy nansen's reports to the league of nations and the records of its debates provide an authentic and comprehensive account of his activities during these years3 i shall try with the aid of this material to give an outline of the principal facts in april 1920 the league of nations charged professor nansen with the direction of the repatriation of the prisoners of war who had not yet been exchanged he was authorized to negotiate with the various governments and to cooperate with the organizations which had already begun this work there were then about half a million people languishing in europe and asia still waiting to return to their homes the greater part of them had been made prisoners during the gigantic struggle between russia and germany in the early years of the war so they had been waiting for four five and even six years most of them had suffered exceedingly both physically and mentally homeless starved tortured unwanted where they were they longed to return to the homes from which they had been torn and where they were now anxiously awaited as representative of the league of nations nansen immediately approached the soviet and german governments as well as those of a number of other states and concluded agreements for the delivery of the prisoners and for their board and transport relying particularly on using the baltic route he succeeded after considerable difficulty in chartering some of the ships which germany was to deliver to england under the terms of the peace treaty4 these were used for the repatriation of the prisoners which now proceeded quickly and at unexpectedly low cost some of the prisoners those from eastern siberia had to be sent home via vladivostok others through the black sea thus creating more serious problems as well as entailing more time the greatest difficulty however was in raising the required funds for it was necessary to arrange governmental loans to a number of the central european states whose prisoners were to be returned this took some time but was successfully accomplished in the end in september 1921 nansen was able to report to the league of nations that it had been possible to repatriate 350,000 prisoners via the baltic 12,000 via vladivostok and 5,000 via the black sea his task was practically finished but even before it could be concluded nansen was given another and still more difficult one russian refugees had settled all over europe their number being estimated at one and a half million some of them had managed to obtain work and put down roots where they were but many were without work or resources and consequently were a burden to the countries in which they lived in june 1921 the council of the league of nations decided to appoint a high_commissioner whose assignment would be to promote mutual cooperation between nations with a view to transferring unemployed and needy prisoners to countries where work was available in august 1921 nansen took over this post of high_commissioner his first job was to obtain a clear picture of this multitude of scattered and homeless human_beings and to consider what future possibilities could be opened up for them having done this he had to negotiate with countries which might be willing to accept russian refugees and provide them with work and opportunity obviously it was here that the greatest difficulties would be encountered nansen started negotiations with a number of governments and also appointed representatives who could negotiate on his behalf as had to be expected a number of states refused to accept any refugees but many others responded favorably moreover a large number of refugees originally from countries which were separated from russia after the war for example many estonians were taken back home this work has already achieved a large measure of success it has been hampered and delayed however by the inadequacy of the funds available in one of his reports to the council of the league of nations nansen says that the whole problem could have been solved much more quickly if he had had at his disposal only a fraction of the huge sums which the governments paid out during a single year to support the russian refugees with this work still in progress nansen received his third and most formidable mission the famine in russia had assumed enormous proportions and threatened to ravage vast areas the lives of twenty to thirty million people were at stake in august 1921 nansen was asked to direct the famine relief work this time the request came not from the league of nations but from a conference of governments and private organizations held in geneva5 from one point of view nansen's task was not so difficult for although millions in russia were starving and approaching certain ruin unless they were given aid there were huge quantities of grain in other countries in the united_states for example the wheat lay rotting for lack of buyers and in argentina there was such an abundance of maize that it was used as fuel for railway engines nor did the shipment of the grain to russia present a great problem since whole fleets of ships were lying idle moreover the transport network inside russia itself was adequate for the distribution of the grain especially if it arrived before winter closed rivers and lakes there was however another and greater difficulty to be faced in a world where nations social classes and individuals fought each_other to further their own ideas and ambitions there had to be created a feeling of solidarity strong_enough to transcend national_frontiers and political differences nansen immediately approached the soviet government and concluded an agreement on two points first that the grain sent would reach those for whom it was intended and second that nansen would be empowered on_behalf of the soviet government to ask the european governments for a credit of ten_million pounds the work of obtaining the grain supplies started without delay considerable sums of money were raised through private and semiofficial organizations and from private donations and large shipments were made to solve the problem completely it was essential to arrange a loan to russia since it was decided that the scheme could not and should not be based_on charity alone this matter of a loan met with a serious obstacle for the soviet government was not recognized nor the political system which it represented approved by the other governments6 consequently in spite of the agreements concluded by nansen there were many who remained unconvinced that the aid given would really benefit those for whom it was intended nansen's hardest task was to break down this opposition time and again he turned to the league of nations for moral support in his demand that credit be granted to the russian state in a powerful speech the words of which still ring in our ears he argued before the league of nations that the rescue of millions from death by starvation should not be impeded by political considerations even if political considerations are taken into account he says they too indicate that aid must be given for it is the very areas in europe that have hitherto yielded the largest exports of grain which are now being devastated can europe do without the volga districts can it do without russia some argue that to send grain to russia is to aid the soviet government nansen answers i do not believe that we are supporting the soviet simply because we are showing the russian people that there is compassion in europe but suppose that such aid would support the soviet is there any man who dares come forward and say it is better to allow twenty million people to die of starvation than to support the soviet government it has not been possible to obtain the credit for russia states have contributed norway among others private and semiofficial organizations have raised large sums of money but the help which could have halted the disaster in the beginning has been withheld the consequence is that the work has not yielded the results which could have been achieved millions it is true have been helped and in the end nearly ten_million were being kept alive but many have succumbed between two and four million of them and since the harvest this year was poor because the spring sowing was done by people who were starving and short of both seed corn and working beasts we can predict that the distress will again be appalling when spring approaches nansen has now been entrusted with a fourth mission of an international character as the high_commissioner of the league of nations he is going to direct the work of aiding the unfortunate people of all races and religions who have become victims of the greco turkish war it is necessary above_all to help the refugees who are now streaming in from eastern thrace and asia minor to the balkan countries and greece7 this work is now in progress and the newspapers carry reports of it every day these are the missions with which nansen has been charged and the work that he has accomplished an account of which we wished to give here he has found at his side however not only a great number of individuals but also a series of organizations with which he has worked and which deserve a large share of the credit for the results obtained8 the human mind cannot visualize this enormous activity any more_than it can grasp astronomical figures one starving person one human being lying like forgotten wreckage on a street corner wasting away bit by bit this we understand here our feeling is so strong it becomes compassion one refugee even a crowd of refugees if you like pushing their children and their possessions in wheelbarrows in front of them this we understand but millions of these hunted like game from country to country behind them the fires of their burning homes before them the emptiness of a future over which they have no control here our minds stop dead instead of producing images they merely play back the statistics presented to them charity on an intimate scale even charity on a larger scale for our countrymen or for our provinces this is within our reach this we understand but a program whose aim is to rescue a continent's millions from misery and death this presents proportions so immense and involves such a myriad of jumbled details that we give up and allow our minds to rest it will be the task of future generations to give this work its proper place in world history we who have lived through it can merely make a few observations upon it and that is what i wish to do now what is it that has sustained the work is it the functioning of the ordinary machinery of nations is it the stirring of the consciences of politicians and statesmen which has found such magnificent expression oh no the source lies deeper it lies in the fact that it was to the people themselves to their deepest and broadest stratum that the appeal was addressed and from them a world opinion crystallized indeed war had to be declared against all political considerations to enable the idea and the feeling to break through the barriers erected by nations classes and individuals the appeal had to reach those innermost depths in man which no statecraft can enter men's deepest feelings are often invoked and often by politics but the feelings politics stirs up are most frequently those which divide national self interest class consciousness suspicion lust for power there are times it is true when politics appeals to that which unites not only to what unites nations and social classes but also to what binds mankind together most closely but this does_not happen often for me one of the most_important aspects of the work before us is that it has penetrated the very depths of the human feeling which lies buried within all of us the feeling that the family of man is one whatever its national or social divisions as nansen says in one of his speeches it is love for one's neighbor that he has wished to enroll in the service of his work and he has succeeded progress has not been rapid and the goal is still far away this wave of warmth rising from so deep within has struck ice and cold nevertheless it has advanced far enough that the work it has supported has become an event in the history of mankind in the forefront of it all we see a number of combatants each stationed at his post organizations and individuals engaged year after year in the struggle to clear a path through all the barriers which stand between the victims of misfortune and their rescuers at their head we see first and foremost one single man what burdens he has borne upon his shoulders what organizing ability his work has demanded what energy and initiative what self_sacrificing patience what talent for coming straight to the heart of any problem what he has lived through this man who has seen europe's misery at first hand and who has felt a sense of responsibility for it seeing him in our midst today awakens many memories behind him is a life which we have all in our thoughts lived with him perhaps what has most impressed all of us is his ability to stake his life time and time again on a single idea on one thought and to inspire others to follow him we remember a young boy for he was but little more_than that crossing greenland on skis he thought that up there in the north where the costly expeditions from great nations always suffered shipwreck norwegian sports equipment and norwegian familiarity with ice and snow would be able to succeed he did succeed and his trip became a landmark in the history of arctic exploration we recall too a mature man who on the basis of his scientific knowledge developed the theory that a current flows from east to west across the polar sea nearly all the scientists believed that he was wrong but he staked his life on the theory he allowed himself to be frozen into the eastern ice to be carried over the pole the current was there and carried him forward to his goal9 and is it not much the same thing that we have now witnessed an undercurrent in which few have believed has again carried nansen forward the deep current of human feeling which lies beneath the layer of ice in which nations and individuals encase themselves during the daily struggles and the trials of life he believed in this current and because he did his work has triumphed may this current also carry much for the future 1 the league of nations created the office of high_commissioner for refugees on

biography we still remember it vividly that event of over eight years_ago for four long years the world had resounded with the fearful din of the battlefields the piercing cries of the dying the forlorn laments of parents and widows over the bloody corpses of their sons and husbands then suddenly the terrible nightmare faded the roar of the cannons was stilled the unbelievable had really happened the world war had ended europe breathed again raised its head gazed out over the disconsolate fields of battle over the endless mounds of smoldering ruins toward the horizon and the breaking day but the day would not be hurried dark clouds gathered from all sides and spread from country to country stormy skies cast their menacing shadows first in one place then in another it was as if everyone was waiting for a dawn which would not come now insidious doubt seeps into men's minds breeding a melancholy uneasiness fear takes hold and the powers of darkness gain sway suspicion and distrust grow between nations between classes and only thistles prosper in such soil hatred grows increasing insecurity and fear paralyze all initiative opening the way to every kind of blunder there is talk of another war it is as if the world which had once before hovered on the brink and peered down into the abyss but which had at the eleventh hour dragged itself onto safer ground is once_again in perilous darkness being drawn back into the depths what is wrong what is missing it is the good human qualities that can grow only in the light of day forbearance confidence compassion the sincere desire for full cooperation in rebuilding the world a peace settlement following a ruinous war can easily degenerate into the imposition by the victors of more or less humiliating conditions upon the vanquished such terms in their turn can easily bear fruit which will in time ripen into a fresh war the peace of versailles can certainly not be said to constitute an exception to this rule the more protracted the withering trial of war the harsher the conditions imposed so when victory is finally won the demands are difficult or even impossible to fulfill the coercion used to compel the vanquished to give beyond their capabilities only breeds greater hatred and the thirst for revenge failure to receive what the victors consider their just compensation for the wounds suffered in war begets disappointment and frustration to these is added the insecurity and fear of possible consequences when forcible and oppressive means must be used to recover claims the difficulties mount steadily nations move further and further apart insecurity fear anxiety foster rearmament such is the picture that europe presented in 1923 more_than four years after the ending of the war when germany found herself unable to pay the reparations to which the french felt entitled french troops marched into and occupied the ruhr the result was the disruption of the entire production of europe hatred of france flared up in germany more violently than ever paralyzing despondency spread among people of all european nations and talk of the next war became more and more common then when the darkness was deepest america extended a helping_hand the united_states had hitherto kept out of the situation and was thus able to observe the unhappy events in europe calmly and in perspective the americans now felt obliged to try to help europe back onto her feet an idea which had already been voiced by u.s secretary of state hughes1 in december 1922 now gained increasing support this was that germany's capacity to pay reparations should be investigated by a competent committee in order to obtain an expert scientific basis for future deliberations the idea eventually found favor with poincart and the french and it was then agreed to appoint a committee of experts the american government sent owen d young and charles g dawes the latter becoming chairman of the committee2 the first meeting took_place in paris on january 14 1924 by april 9 of the same year the committee had drafted a plan later known as the dawes plan the committee proposed that the reparations should be paid by an altogether different system and that a moratorium should first be applied it further proposed among other measures the complete reorganization of germany's finances and the granting of a foreign loan the plan also regarded as an economic necessity the return of the ruhr to germany the importance of this plan was already evident from the fact that when it became apparent at the end of july 1924 that it would be accepted by the allied governments confidence in the european economy immediately began to revive and there was a consequent and marked improvement in the strength of european currency it is true that the plan envisaged a substantial reduction in the war reparations which germany was to pay but it did at least seek to ensure a considerable payment each year its adoption contributed to the decision to evacuate the ruhr it also brought a temporary halt to the endless conflicts about germany's reparations which had been largely responsible for the pessimistic outlook in europe and for the anxiety and insecurity which had characterized the first five_years of peace the plan was important not only for germany france and the allies but both economically and politically for the whole of europe and consequently for america as well it restored confidence in the economy and future of europe it brought her safely through an acute crisis which could have resulted in the most serious danger to peace but its greatest significance lies in the fact that it was a symptom of a psychological change in european mentality and at the same_time a powerful impetus for continued change it marked the beginning of the policy of reconciliation and peace which led to the locarno agreements this was the first dawning of the day after the long darkness another memorable step along the path of peace was the geneva_protocol adopted by the league of nations assembly in the autumn of 19243 for the first time the delegates of nations from all parts of the world declared aggressive war to be a crime they also adopted the principle that all international controversies without exception must be settled by peaceful_means either by arbitration or before a court of law it is true that the protocol was not ratified by the governments nevertheless it is an important milestone in history and its spirit should not be ignored by the statesmen of the future for it was this spirit which prepared the way for what was to be accomplished later the next great milestone bears the name of locarno the initiative on this occasion came from germany from chancellor luther and foreign_minister stresemann4 during the negotiations which preceded the geneva_protocol the french and especially briand its warm advocate strongly urged the necessity of guarantees to provide security against aggression and war in a note dated february 9 1925 germany outlined the security guarantees which she believed were required and suggested a possible form for a security treaty which could prepare the ground for a world convention of all states similar to that arranged for the geneva_protocol by the league of nations for the peaceful settlement of international disagreements following extensive negotiations a meeting took_place in locarno from october 5 to october 16 of 1925 france was represented by briand germany by luther and stresemann great_britain by chamberlain italy by mussolini belgium by vandervelde poland by skrzyriski and czechoslovakia by benes5 a treaty clarifying the question of the rhineland was concluded between germany belgium france great_britain and italy and four arbitration_agreements were made between germany on the one side and belgium france poland and czechoslovakia on the other i shall not go into greater detail on the provisions of these treaties for they are well_known of the rhineland treaty it has been said that for the first time since louis xiv6 the rhine has ceased to be a cause of dissension in european politics so closes a chapter in history under the four arbitration_agreements the nations undertake to submit to peaceful settlement through impartial mediation or arbitration all disputes except those arising out of past events which took_place prior to the present agreement the locarno agreements mark a radical and complete change in european politics transforming the relations_between the former antagonists in the war and infusing them with an entirely new spirit this spirit derives from the almost unprecedented attempt to base politics on the principle of mutual friendship and trust what inspires one's confidence is that it was neither idealism nor altruism but a sense of necessity which prompted those concerned to make the attempt the men who met at locarno are no idealistic pacifists they are realistic politicians and responsible statesmen who having originally pursued directly conflicting policies have come to the realization that the only chance of creating a real future for mankind is to stand united in a sincere desire to work together in a speech he made after the signing of the agreements briand aptly remarked the war has taught_us one thing namely that a common fate binds us together if we go under we go under together if we wish to recover we cannot do so in conflict with each_other but only by working together 7 both briand and stresemann have rightly emphasized that every individual must first be a good citizen of his own_country a good frenchman a good german a good briton but still a good european bound to other europeans by the great ideals of the european civilization so gravely menaced by the events of the last war if we are to appreciate fully what these statesmen accomplished at locarno for the peace of europe then we must not overlook the violent nationalistic opposition in their own countries which several of them had to overcome in order to push through the peace program they strode ahead fearlessly in the conviction that they had now found the right road with locarno an accomplished fact it seemed as though a new day would be breaking and renewed courage and confidence would be returning to europe with ever increasing tempo but the agreements were not yet activated one of their provisions was that germany should enter the league of nations this step however was to encounter more serious difficulties than had been anticipated still fresh in our memory is that distressing special_session of the assembly at geneva last march when the delegates met for the sole purpose of admitting germany into the league only to depart without having been able to do it but these events were followed by the assembly meeting at geneva last september when germany's delegates with stresemann at their head were able to enter honorably and take their places among the members of the league no one who was present will forget that moment germany's admission was welcomed in a remarkable speech by briand among other_things he said no more war from now on it will be for the judge to decide what is right just as individual citizens settle their disagreements before a judge so shall we also resolve ours by peaceful_means away with rifles machine guns cannons make way for conciliation arbitration peace 8 on this point we can now see daylight again is it not almost as if we are seeing the new earth turn green again after armageddon9 the locarno pacts together with germany's entry_into the league of nations and the speeches which followed it hold much promise for the future they all tend to build_up confidence and to strengthen the will to carry on the good work but all this must not blind us to the fact that there is still a long way to go before the goal is reached and lasting peace really secured noble words and noble intent on the part of leaders are a great encouragement but they are not enough words must be translated_into action intent into earnest toil for shining promises have often come to nothing in the past and the blue skies of hope have again been filled by storm clouds our watchword must be no more war and what does this mean it does_not mean no more world war with everyone and especially the principal powers free to indulge in small private wars whenever they are so disposed it does_not mean no more war except when a power is able without any great effort on its part to crush a weak neighbor that falls easy prey to superior force it does_not mean no more war except when what we used to call national honor is at stake it means none of these what it does mean is no more war of any kind whatsoever no more aggression no more of the bloody and futile clashes which have tarnished the history of mankind for so long it means working to eradicate the use of force from national policies to stamp out suppression of others in whatever form it appears to liberate ourselves now and for all time as we in this generation can do if we so resolve from the hideous corruption of warfare between different groups of the human race be it between nations or within nations i say without hesitation that this is the greatest of all the causes which now command our attention the question of how we can put an end to all war is the vital problem of our time not only for international politics but for national politics as well this may strike many people as an exaggeration even as a misuse of language to them such problems as those of miners strikes social reform customs barriers prohibition or whatever seem far more important i say with utter conviction that those_who think so are wrong war preparation for war the burden of armament particularly in the case of the larger countries these are the first and vital problems if we can erect barriers against war if we can abolish the armament burdens which europe suffers today if we can destroy the evil specter of militarism which still haunts the world and so vouchsafe complete security for all time then we shall obtain and swiftly at that the social reforms we desire the development of our resources the many forms of progress we hope for we shall move forward toward a new and better life but if we do not get rid of war if we do not put a complete end to it if europe does_not reduce and limit its armaments then we shall have no reforms and no progress of any significance we can be certain that in the future just as in the past armament will call forth counterarmament alliances and counteralliances it will engender suspicion and distrust bringing fear to men's hearts it will lead to international crises it will lead to war perhaps to small local wars at first but finally and inescapably it will bring down upon us a great world war no less frightful than the last if the work for disarmament which the league of nations has now begun does_not produce results if the level of armaments is maintained then war will result it seems to me that all our past experience shows this to be incontrovertible but do not take my word for it listen to what more qualified authorities have to say lord grey foreign_minister of great_britain at the outbreak of the war10 has said and he has said it time and time again that it was europe's steadily increasing armaments which led to the war in 1914 he has warned us that if armaments in europe are maintained if the nations of the world embark on a new contest in military preparedness we will bring upon ourselves anew war as inevitably as we did the last one and he has told us that a new war will mean the end of our civilization as we know it today who will question lord grey's authority to speak on this subject many other leading statesmen have uttered the same sentiments on several occasions let_me mention just one as recently as january of this year mr baldwin the present prime_minister of great britain11 said a new war in the west and the civilization of our era will collapse in a fall as great as that of rome these men i have mentioned are not fanatics indeed not even pacifists they are responsible statesmen who have exercised or who will in the future exercise great power in the leadership of the world if they mean their statements seriously then it seems to me to follow that there is scarcely any other political problem worth discussing until the problem of the next war is resolved let_us pause for a moment to consider what they have said it may seem fantastic to state that our civilization can be obliterated we have a sense of vitality and strength a feeling that a great future lies ahead of us but let_us not forget that civilizations have been wiped out before powerful nations which seemed as strong then as the most powerful states of our time seem to us now have vanished the roman empire which ruled europe for a period hundreds of years longer than the lifetime of our modern western civilization was swept away by the invasion of barbaric hordes you have no sense of any impending disaster you are too conscious of the forces of life around you i feel the same i too feel these forces but i also sense that the last war inflicted upon our civilization a terrible wound a painful wound that is still far from healed it was as if the very foundations shook under europe and worst of all most europeans still do not understand the true nature and significance of the last war they are already about to forget it before they have learned the lesson it should teach them they are forgetting their dead of course there are still millions of people in practically every country of europe who cannot forget the horrors of the war the carnage of the battlefields once seen is not easily forgotten these people can tell of the merciless slaughter on the lovely countryside of france of the agony of mind the terror inspired by the big bombardments and the ceaseless rattle of gunfire in a modern offensive of the inconceivable suffering of wounded and broken men hanging perhaps for days on barbed wire crying out for the death which they themselves had not the strength to inflict of such horrors and worse can these people tell and if europe would only heed them if all its people would only remember the war's bestiality its barbaric cruelty they would see to it that war would never occur again but there are other aspects of war which i perhaps more_than most people have had the opportunity to observe for more_than six years now it has been my task on_behalf of the league of nations12 to investigate and as far as possible to alleviate the terrible aftereffects of war during all these years i have had to deal with hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war with famine with refugees frightened refugees each with his own story of endless heartrending tragedy the old the women the little helpless children left alone because of the vicissitudes of war and all of them lost plundered bereft of everything of value in this world i wish i could give you a picture of what i have seen and experienced i wish i could just for one moment make you feel what it is to see a whole nation fleeing in wild terror along the country roads or to travel among a people struck down by famine to enter huts where men women and children lie still no_longer complaining waiting only for death in countries where corpses are dug up out of their graves and eaten where maddened mothers slay their own children for food but no i cannot attempt it now all this endless misfortune all this misery and incredible suffering these hundreds of thousands of forsaken prisoners of war these famines these millions of helpless refugees they are all directly or indirectly the results of the war but believe me all these calamities cannot occur without undermining our entire social system they sap the vitality of nations and they inflict wounds so deep that they will take a long time to heal if they ever do and still even still people talk about the probability of another war do we not stop to think what this would mean even if the next war is no worse than the last i believe it will destroy our european civilization but of course the next war will not be like the last it will be incomparably worse i shall not weary you by going further into that it is enough to say that in the event of a new war we face the threatening fact that our civilization can be annihilated just as other civilizations have been annihilated in the past but we also have the means to avert this threat war does_not come unless we wish it upon ourselves war is not the result of some uncontrollable catastrophe of nature it is the result of man's will it is his own shame and truly with reasonable policies it would be comparatively easy to put an end to war let_me suggest the course which i believe can lead us forward the governments of europe must unite around and stake their all on what i shall for the sake of brevity call the league of nations policy do not misunderstand me here the league of nations is no_longer a remote or abstract idea it is a living organism its institutions are now an essential part of the machinery of world control if we can put the full force of the combined power of individual governments behind these institutions behind the policy of disarmament behind all the policies pursued by the league then we shall put an end to war but the governments whether of large countries or of small must stake everything on this policy without reservations there must be no clinging to ancient rights to wage private wars there must be no secret hopes that if the league is weak in certain areas it can be made to serve private interests we must follow the new road in international politics mapped out at locarno and we must burn behind us the bridges that lead back to the old policies and the old systems which have failed us so tragically it has always been my conviction that in the great things of life it is of decisive_importance to have no line of retreat a principle which certainly holds good here by the very nature of things progress will depend essentially on the actions of the great_powers but small nations like our own can also do much for the large states must take into account such a variety of factors such a multitude of conflicting_interests that their leaders may often find it difficult to follow their own convictions assessing all the time as they must the political currents among their electorates the national self interests of their countries not to mention the complex intrigues which frequently surround them all these circumstances can often restrict their freedom to act small nations and their leaders enjoy greater latitude in this respect they have fewer conflicting_interests and for them a policy of peace without restrictions or reservations is a natural one if all the small nations will work together resolutely and systematically in the league of nations to lay the ghost of war they can achieve much greatly strengthening the league in the process certainly it cannot be denied that the great_powers can give and on occasion have given the impression of acting somewhat arbitrarily and without proper consideration for the views of the other members of the league but the small nations have ample opportunity to state their case if they will just confidently take it and when they fail to do so the blame falls chiefly on themselves as briand said in his splendid speech to the last assembly there must in future be no more resorting to methods of negotiation which are inconsistent with the true spirit of the league of nations and the league's work shall in future take place in the full light of day and with the collaboration of all its members 13 it is then the duty of all members and not least of the small nations to unite in the task of abolishing war to participate positively in this work not to wait passively but to act if we really want to put an end to war if we want to be rid of heavy armaments the governments must as i have said stake everything upon the policy of the league of nations without thinking about any lines of retreat they must work in every way and at every opportunity to build_up the power and strength of the league if they do so and if their peoples support them in the same spirit then shall the evil monster of war be felled and our future secured for the work of peace that of building not tearing down we still remember it vividly that event of over eight years_ago for four long years the world had resounded with the fearful din of the battlefields the piercing cries of the dying the forlorn laments of parents and widows over the bloody corpses of their sons and husbands then suddenly the terrible nightmare faded the roar of the cannons was stilled the unbelievable had really happened the world war had ended europe breathed again raised its head gazed out over the disconsolate fields of battle over the endless mounds of smoldering ruins toward the horizon and the breaking day but the day would not be hurried dark clouds gathered from all sides and spread from country to country stormy skies cast their menacing shadows first in one place then in another it was as if everyone was waiting for a dawn which would not come now insidious doubt seeps into men's minds breeding a melancholy uneasiness fear takes hold and the powers of darkness gain sway suspicion and distrust grow between nations between classes and only thistles prosper in such soil hatred grows increasing insecurity and fear paralyze all initiative opening the way to every kind of blunder there is talk of another war it is as if the world which had once before hovered on the brink and peered down into the abyss but which had at the eleventh hour dragged itself onto safer ground is once_again in perilous darkness being drawn back into the depths what is wrong what is missing it is the good human qualities that can grow only in the light of day forbearance confidence compassion the sincere desire for full cooperation in rebuilding the world a peace settlement following a ruinous war can easily degenerate into the imposition by the victors of more or less humiliating conditions upon the vanquished such terms in their turn can easily bear fruit which will in time ripen into a fresh war the peace of versailles can certainly not be said to constitute an exception to this rule the more protracted the withering trial of war the harsher the conditions imposed so when victory is finally won the demands are difficult or even impossible to fulfill the coercion used to compel the vanquished to give beyond their capabilities only breeds greater hatred and the thirst for revenge failure to receive what the victors consider their just compensation for the wounds suffered in war begets disappointment and frustration to these is added the insecurity and fear of possible consequences when forcible and oppressive means must be used to recover claims the difficulties mount steadily nations move further and further apart insecurity fear anxiety foster rearmament such is the picture that europe presented in 1923 more_than four years after the ending of the war when germany found herself unable to pay the reparations to which the french felt entitled french troops marched into and occupied the ruhr the result was the disruption of the entire production of europe hatred of france flared up in germany more violently than ever paralyzing despondency spread among people of all european nations and talk of the next war became more and more common then when the darkness was deepest america extended a helping_hand the united_states had hitherto kept out of the situation and was thus able to observe the unhappy events in europe calmly and in perspective the americans now felt obliged to try to help europe back onto her feet an idea which had already been voiced by u.s secretary of state hughes1 in december 1922 now gained increasing support this was that germany's capacity to pay reparations should be investigated by a competent committee in order to obtain an expert scientific basis for future deliberations the idea eventually found favor with poincart and the french and it was then agreed to appoint a committee of experts the american government sent owen d young and charles g dawes the latter becoming chairman of the committee2 the first meeting took_place in paris on january 14 1924 by april 9 of the same year the committee had drafted a plan later known as the dawes plan the committee proposed that the reparations should be paid by an altogether different system and that a moratorium should first be applied it further proposed among other measures the complete reorganization of germany's finances and the granting of a foreign loan the plan also regarded as an economic necessity the return of the ruhr to germany the importance of this plan was already evident from the fact that when it became apparent at the end of july 1924 that it would be accepted by the allied governments confidence in the european economy immediately began to revive and there was a consequent and marked improvement in the strength of european currency it is true that the plan envisaged a substantial reduction in the war reparations which germany was to pay but it did at least seek to ensure a considerable payment each year its adoption contributed to the decision to evacuate the ruhr it also brought a temporary halt to the endless conflicts about germany's reparations which had been largely responsible for the pessimistic outlook in europe and for the anxiety and insecurity which had characterized the first five_years of peace the plan was important not only for germany france and the allies but both economically and politically for the whole of europe and consequently for america as well it restored confidence in the economy and future of europe it brought her safely through an acute crisis which could have resulted in the most serious danger to peace but its greatest significance lies in the fact that it was a symptom of a psychological change in european mentality and at the same_time a powerful impetus for continued change it marked the beginning of the policy of reconciliation and peace which led to the locarno agreements this was the first dawning of the day after the long darkness another memorable step along the path of peace was the geneva_protocol adopted by the league of nations assembly in the autumn of 19243 for the first time the delegates of nations from all parts of the world declared aggressive war to be a crime they also adopted the principle that all international controversies without exception must be settled by peaceful_means either by arbitration or before a court of law it is true that the protocol was not ratified by the governments nevertheless it is an important milestone in history and its spirit should not be ignored by the statesmen of the future for it was this spirit which prepared the way for what was to be accomplished later the next great milestone bears the name of locarno the initiative on this occasion came from germany from chancellor luther and foreign_minister stresemann4 during the negotiations which preceded the geneva_protocol the french and especially briand its warm advocate strongly urged the necessity of guarantees to provide security against aggression and war in a note dated february 9 1925 germany outlined the security guarantees which she believed were required and suggested a possible form for a security treaty which could prepare the ground for a world convention of all states similar to that arranged for the geneva_protocol by the league of nations for the peaceful settlement of international disagreements following extensive negotiations a meeting took_place in locarno from october 5 to october 16 of 1925 france was represented by briand germany by luther and stresemann great_britain by chamberlain italy by mussolini belgium by vandervelde poland by skrzyriski and czechoslovakia by benes5 a treaty clarifying the question of the rhineland was concluded between germany belgium france great_britain and italy and four arbitration_agreements were made between germany on the one side and belgium france poland and czechoslovakia on the other i shall not go into greater detail on the provisions of these treaties for they are well_known of the rhineland treaty it has been said that for the first time since louis xiv6 the rhine has ceased to be a cause of dissension in european politics so closes a chapter in history under the four arbitration_agreements the nations undertake to submit to peaceful settlement through impartial mediation or arbitration all disputes except those arising out of past events which took_place prior to the present agreement the locarno agreements mark a radical and complete change in european politics transforming the relations_between the former antagonists in the war and infusing them with an entirely new spirit this spirit derives from the almost unprecedented attempt to base politics on the principle of mutual friendship and trust what inspires one's confidence is that it was neither idealism nor altruism but a sense of necessity which prompted those concerned to make the attempt the men who met at locarno are no idealistic pacifists they are realistic politicians and responsible statesmen who having originally pursued directly conflicting policies have come to the realization that the only chance of creating a real future for mankind is to stand united in a sincere desire to work together in a speech he made after the signing of the agreements briand aptly remarked the war has taught_us one thing namely that a common fate binds us together if we go under we go under together if we wish to recover we cannot do so in conflict with each_other but only by working together 7 both briand and stresemann have rightly emphasized that every individual must first be a good citizen of his own_country a good frenchman a good german a good briton but still a good european bound to other europeans by the great ideals of the european civilization so gravely menaced by the events of the last war if we are to appreciate fully what these statesmen accomplished at locarno for the peace of europe then we must not overlook the violent nationalistic opposition in their own countries which several of them had to overcome in order to push through the peace program they strode ahead fearlessly in the conviction that they had now found the right road with locarno an accomplished fact it seemed as though a new day would be breaking and renewed courage and confidence would be returning to europe with ever increasing tempo but the agreements were not yet activated one of their provisions was that germany should enter the league of nations this step however was to encounter more serious difficulties than had been anticipated still fresh in our memory is that distressing special_session of the assembly at geneva last march when the delegates met for the sole purpose of admitting germany into the league only to depart without having been able to do it but these events were followed by the assembly meeting at geneva last september when germany's delegates with stresemann at their head were able to enter honorably and take their places among the members of the league no one who was present will forget that moment germany's admission was welcomed in a remarkable speech by briand among other_things he said no more war from now on it will be for the judge to decide what is right just as individual citizens settle their disagreements before a judge so shall we also resolve ours by peaceful_means away with rifles machine guns cannons make way for conciliation arbitration peace 8 on this point we can now see daylight again is it not almost as if we are seeing the new earth turn green again after armageddon9 the locarno pacts together with germany's entry_into the league of nations and the speeches which followed it hold much promise for the future they all tend to build_up confidence and to strengthen the will to carry on the good work but all this must not blind us to the fact that there is still a long way to go before the goal is reached and lasting peace really secured noble words and noble intent on the part of leaders are a great encouragement but they are not enough words must be translated_into action intent into earnest toil for shining promises have often come to nothing in the past and the blue skies of hope have again been filled by storm clouds our watchword must be no more war and what does this mean it does_not mean no more world war with everyone and especially the principal powers free to indulge in small private wars whenever they are so disposed it does_not mean no more war except when a power is able without any great effort on its part to crush a weak neighbor that falls easy prey to superior force it does_not mean no more war except when what we used to call national honor is at stake it means none of these what it does mean is no more war of any kind whatsoever no more aggression no more of the bloody and futile clashes which have tarnished the history of mankind for so long it means working to eradicate the use of force from national policies to stamp out suppression of others in whatever form it appears to liberate ourselves now and for all time as we in this generation can do if we so resolve from the hideous corruption of warfare between different groups of the human race be it between nations or within nations i say without hesitation that this is the greatest of all the causes which now command our attention the question of how we can put an end to all war is the vital problem of our time not only for international politics but for national politics as well this may strike many people as an exaggeration even as a misuse of language to them such problems as those of miners strikes social reform customs barriers prohibition or whatever seem far more important i say with utter conviction that those_who think so are wrong war preparation for war the burden of armament particularly in the case of the larger countries these are the first and vital problems if we can erect barriers against war if we can abolish the armament burdens which europe suffers today if we can destroy the evil specter of militarism which still haunts the world and so vouchsafe complete security for all time then we shall obtain and swiftly at that the social reforms we desire the development of our resources the many forms of progress we hope for we shall move forward toward a new and better life but if we do not get rid of war if we do not put a complete end to it if europe does_not reduce and limit its armaments then we shall have no reforms and no progress of any significance we can be certain that in the future just as in the past armament will call forth counterarmament alliances and counteralliances it will engender suspicion and distrust bringing fear to men's hearts it will lead to international crises it will lead to war perhaps to small local wars at first but finally and inescapably it will bring down upon us a great world war no less frightful than the last if the work for disarmament which the league of nations has now begun does_not produce results if the level of armaments is maintained then war will result it seems to me that all our past experience shows this to be incontrovertible but do not take my word for it listen to what more qualified authorities have to say lord grey foreign_minister of great_britain at the outbreak of the war10 has said and he has said it time and time again that it was europe's steadily increasing armaments which led to the war in 1914 he has warned us that if armaments in europe are maintained if the nations of the world embark on a new contest in military preparedness we will bring upon ourselves anew war as inevitably as we did the last one and he has told us that a new war will mean the end of our civilization as we know it today who will question lord grey's authority to speak on this subject many other leading statesmen have uttered the same sentiments on several occasions let_me mention just one as recently as january of this year mr baldwin the present prime_minister of great britain11 said a new war in the west and the civilization of our era will collapse in a fall as great as that of rome these men i have mentioned are not fanatics indeed not even pacifists they are responsible statesmen who have exercised or who will in the future exercise great power in the leadership of the world if they mean their statements seriously then it seems to me to follow that there is scarcely any other political problem worth discussing until the problem of the next war is resolved let_us pause for a moment to consider what they have said it may seem fantastic to state that our civilization can be obliterated we have a sense of vitality and strength a feeling that a great future lies ahead of us but let_us not forget that civilizations have been wiped out before powerful nations which seemed as strong then as the most powerful states of our time seem to us now have vanished the roman empire which ruled europe for a period hundreds of years longer than the lifetime of our modern western civilization was swept away by the invasion of barbaric hordes you have no sense of any impending disaster you are too conscious of the forces of life around you i feel the same i too feel these forces but i also sense that the last war inflicted upon our civilization a terrible wound a painful wound that is still far from healed it was as if the very foundations shook under europe and worst of all most europeans still do not understand the true nature and significance of the last war they are already about to forget it before they have learned the lesson it should teach them they are forgetting their dead of course there are still millions of people in practically every country of europe who cannot forget the horrors of the war the carnage of the battlefields once seen is not easily forgotten these people can tell of the merciless slaughter on the lovely countryside of france of the agony of mind the terror inspired by the big bombardments and the ceaseless rattle of gunfire in a modern offensive of the inconceivable suffering of wounded and broken men hanging perhaps for days on barbed wire crying out for the death which they themselves had not the strength to inflict of such horrors and worse can these people tell and if europe would only heed them if all its people would only remember the war's bestiality its barbaric cruelty they would see to it that war would never occur again but there are other aspects of war which i perhaps more_than most people have had the opportunity to observe for more_than six years now it has been my task on_behalf of the league of nations12 to investigate and as far as possible to alleviate the terrible aftereffects of war during all these years i have had to deal with hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war with famine with refugees frightened refugees each with his own story of endless heartrending tragedy the old the women the little helpless children left alone because of the vicissitudes of war and all of them lost plundered bereft of everything of value in this world i wish i could give you a picture of what i have seen and experienced i wish i could just for one moment make you feel what it is to see a whole nation fleeing in wild terror along the country roads or to travel among a people struck down by famine to enter huts where men women and children lie still no_longer complaining waiting only for death in countries where corpses are dug up out of their graves and eaten where maddened mothers slay their own children for food but no i cannot attempt it now all this endless misfortune all this misery and incredible suffering these hundreds of thousands of forsaken prisoners of war these famines these millions of helpless refugees they are all directly or indirectly the results of the war but believe me all these calamities cannot occur without undermining our entire social system they sap the vitality of nations and they inflict wounds so deep that they will take a long time to heal if they ever do and still even still people talk about the probability of another war do we not stop to think what this would mean even if the next war is no worse than the last i believe it will destroy our european civilization but of course the next war will not be like the last it will be incomparably worse i shall not weary you by going further into that it is enough to say that in the event of a new war we face the threatening fact that our civilization can be annihilated just as other civilizations have been annihilated in the past but we also have the means to avert this threat war does_not come unless we wish it upon ourselves war is not the result of some uncontrollable catastrophe of nature it is the result of man's will it is his own shame and truly with reasonable policies it would be comparatively easy to put an end to war let_me suggest the course which i believe can lead us forward the governments of europe must unite around and stake their all on what i shall for the sake of brevity call the league of nations policy do not misunderstand me here the league of nations is no_longer a remote or abstract idea it is a living organism its institutions are now an essential part of the machinery of world control if we can put the full force of the combined power of individual governments behind these institutions behind the policy of disarmament behind all the policies pursued by the league then we shall put an end to war but the governments whether of large countries or of small must stake everything on this policy without reservations there must be no clinging to ancient rights to wage private wars there must be no secret hopes that if the league is weak in certain areas it can be made to serve private interests we must follow the new road in international politics mapped out at locarno and we must burn behind us the bridges that lead back to the old policies and the old systems which have failed us so tragically it has always been my conviction that in the great things of life it is of decisive_importance to have no line of retreat a principle which certainly holds good here by the very nature of things progress will depend essentially on the actions of the great_powers but small nations like our own can also do much for the large states must take into account such a variety of factors such a multitude of conflicting_interests that their leaders may often find it difficult to follow their own convictions assessing all the time as they must the political currents among their electorates the national self interests of their countries not to mention the complex intrigues which frequently surround them all these circumstances can often restrict their freedom to act small nations and their leaders enjoy greater latitude in this respect they have fewer conflicting_interests and for them a policy of peace without restrictions or reservations is a natural one if all the small nations will work together resolutely and systematically in the league of nations to lay the ghost of war they can achieve much greatly strengthening the league in the process certainly it cannot be denied that the great_powers can give and on occasion have given the impression of acting somewhat arbitrarily and without proper consideration for the views of the other members of the league but the small nations have ample opportunity to state their case if they will just confidently take it and when they fail to do so the blame falls chiefly on themselves as briand said in his splendid speech to the last assembly there must in future be no more resorting to methods of negotiation which are inconsistent with the true spirit of the league of nations and the league's work shall in future take place in the full light of day and with the collaboration of all its members 13 it is then the duty of all members and not least of the small nations to unite in the task of abolishing war to participate positively in this work not to wait passively but to act if we really want to put an end to war if we want to be rid of heavy armaments the governments must as i have said stake everything upon the policy of the league of nations without thinking about any lines of retreat they must work in every way and at every opportunity to build_up the power and strength of the league if they do so and if their peoples support them in the same spirit then shall the evil monster of war be felled and our future secured for the work of peace that of building not tearing down the nobel_committee has awarded the peace_prize for this year jointly to ferdinand buisson and ludwig quidde at last year's ceremony the committee gave prominence to three events of historical significance to the world the dawes plan the locarno pact and germany's admission to the league of nations these were political measures effected by responsible agents of government and we emphasized their importance by awarding the peace_prize to four statesmen1 who had rendered outstanding service in making them possible this year we pay_tribute through the nobel prize to a different kind of work for the cause of peace governments and their policies are not the only potential menace to peace a constant and real threat of war also lies in the mentality of men in the psychology of the masses therefore the great organized work for peace must be preceded by the education of the people by a campaign to turn mass thinking away from war as a recognized means of settling disputes and to substitute another and much higher ideal peaceful cooperation between nations with an international court of justice to resolve any disagreements which might arise between them it is in the task of reorienting public_opinion that buisson and quidde have played such prominent roles they have guided this work in two countries where it has been particularly difficult to accomplish but where the need for it has been commensurately great in presenting the nobel peace_prize to buisson and quidde the nobel_committee wishes to recognize the emergence in france and germany of a public_opinion which favors peaceful international cooperation it is this happy circumstance which brought about the rapprochement between germany and france which in turn found expression in the events rewarded at last year's_award ceremony ferdinand buisson was born in paris in 1841 he studied philosophy and pedagogy but was later unable to obtain a position in france because he refused to take the oath to the emperor2 he therefore went to switzerland where he stayed from 1866 to 1870 upon his return to france in the autumn of 1870 he held various educational posts and in 1879 was appointed director of the primary school section of the ministry of public instruction in this capacity he was actively concerned in the drafting and implementing of the laws on free compulsory and nondenominational primary education in france in 1897 he became professor of education at the sorbonne the dreyfus case3 brought buisson into politics he threw himself heart and soul into the struggle waged on_behalf of this unjustly convicted man he joined the french league of the rights of man which inspired by zola's j'accuse4 was founded at the time of the dreyfus affair the aim of this society was to attack every form of injustice and oppression both in france and elsewhere as a member of the radical socialist party buisson was elected to the chamber of deputies in 1902 although defeated in 1914 he returned to the chamber in 1919 holding his seat until 1924 the cause of peace first attracted buisson when he was still a young man he took_part in the first congress of the ligue de_la paix et de_la liberté5 league of peace and liberty in 1867 and wrote articles denouncing militarism and insisting that intensive education of the masses was the way to put an end to war when the world war came buisson did not protest it regarding france as the attacked party he believed that a german victory would mean defeat for justice and the principle of international solidarity during the early years of the war the league also remained passive the essential thing said buisson was to win in order to put an end not only to this war but to all wars convinced that the allies would win in the end he was greatly concerned that they should not misuse their victory but should take action to lay the foundations for a new international world by creating a league of nations from 1916 on he worked tirelessly for a just peace and supported wilson s program the peace turned out to be a bitter disappointment for buisson in an open_letter published on may 23 1919 he criticized the league of nations as it had been structured and described it as a league of the victorious powers of the entente it was nevertheless a fait accompli it must be defended it was therefore necessary to put propaganda to work with a view to shaping the league into an efficient instrument for the prevention of war and for the promotion of international solidarity in a eulogy on wilson in 1924 he expressed his belief that the league would grow that the day would come when it would be a force claiming the respect of the whole world even of those_who then dismissed it with a smile and he preached the disarmament of hatred for this must precede the disarmament of nations buisson and his friends have not confined themselves merely to talking about the disarmament of hatred they have sought to make it a living fact at the time of the ruhr dispute6 they had the courage to try to build a bridge by inviting german friends of peace to paris and then returning the visit to do what they could in germany buisson at the age of eighty four accompanied the delegation speaking on a number of occasions he concluded one address to the german people with these words a force exists which is far greater than france far greater than germany far greater than any nation and that is mankind but above mankind itself stands justice which finds its most perfect expression in human brotherhood ludwig quidde was born in bremen in 1858 he studied at strasbourg and göttingen his main interest being the history of germany in the middle ages after taking his doctorate he devoted some years to historical writing and publishing this pursuit took him to rome for a few years as a staff member of the prussian historical institute there following his return to germany he threw himself into political activity and especially into work for peace being of independent means he had no need to find paid employment and was therefore in a position to devote his undivided efforts to his chosen interests while he was in rome quidde wrote caligula 1894 a small pamphlet of some sixteen pages ostensibly an historically accurate description of the emperor caligula7 and the mad obsessions from which he suffered it was actually a rather transparent satire on emperor wilhelm ii8 the book created a storm it had an enormous sale reputedly reaching a printing of several_hundred thousand copies many people were naturally delighted with it but in others it aroused bitter resentment and for years afterwards quidde was to learn in various ways how deeply the wound had been felt quidde's work for peace began about the time caligula appeared ever_since then he has worked ceaselessly as lecturer and organizer he has taken part in and in many cases presided_over numerous peace congresses he has attended conferences of the interparliamentary union9 and he has written countless publications some of which treated current problems so trenchantly as to lead to their confiscation and even to the institution of legal proceedings against their author for quidde the outbreak of war heralded a period of intensive and diversified activity he went immediately to the hague thinking that from neutral holland he would be able to keep alive his connections with the french english and belgian pacifists in this he was disappointed and so he returned to germany but tried even from there to sway public_opinion in the other belligerent countries his work was divided between organization and writing the war and all the problems it raised led to friction within the pacifist camp in germany impeded organizational operations and made great demands on quidde's ability as a mediator however he succeeded not only in holding the movement together but also in increasing support for the peace organizations all this work left quidde little time to write of the things he published during and after the war i should like to mention two which seem to me to be characteristic of his views and of his manner of working in 1915 he published a pamphlet entitled sollen wir annektieren should we annex in this pamphlet he mounts an attack on the desire for annexation which at that stage of the war found wide support in germany to him it was sheer lunacy to try to secure the peace by destroying the antagonist in this publication he takes no marked political standpoint but sets out in a calm well balanced and pertinently documented argument the political economic and cultural consequences of a peace based_on annexation he himself submits a positive program for peace whose chief point is that the freedom of the seas and the open door policy10 should be secured through the peace settlement the pamphlet was confiscated a revised edition met the same fate but this did not prevent it and a french translation of it from reaching a wide public when the question of guilt arose at the end of the war quidde entered the discussion with his pamphlet die schuldfrage the question of responsibility 11 once_again his subject is calmly reasoned he goes to the root of the question distinguishing between responsibility for creating the circumstances which paved the way for the world war and responsibility for the actions which unleashed war at the decisive moment he does_not share the view of those members of the german pacifist movement who lay all the blame at germany's door and as one might expect he is even less inclined to the other extreme calmly and without passion he draws the distinction between responsibility and guilt analyzing the interrelationship of the many factors involved two qualities stand out in quidde's writing and in his work as a whole moderation and courage although he has never had a chance to publish major works outside his professional field of history all of his work beats the stamp of the historian and the scholar and he has displayed his courage on many occasions his own account of the origins of caligula and of the events associated with it is characteristic of the man as already_mentioned the book appears on the face of it to be an objective portrayal of the roman emperor's life and character in order to make sure that it was historically accurate and that it had been in no way colored by the political purpose behind it he had the manuscript read by several scholars specializing in roman history when he decided to print the pamphlet his friends advised him to do so in switzerland and to publish it anonymously but he had it printed in germany under his own name after the pamphlet's appearance when everyone expected him to be prosecuted his friends advised him to flee to switzerland but he stood fast and remained in his own_country my impression is that quidde's later writings are also imbued with the same devotion to the truth and their publication has on occasion demanded no less courage today the nobel_committee honors two admirable and distinguished servants of peace we thank them for their long and tireless efforts in the cause of peace to work for the cause of peace is to clear a path for honest and just relations_between peoples for recognition of the intrinsic worth of human_beings and of the equal right of all people to live here on earth and for the success of the greatest political idea ever conceived the supplanting of war by peace 1 charles g dawes co_recipient for 1925 austen chamberlain co_recipient for 1925 aristide_briand co_recipient for 1926 gustav stresemann co_recipient for 1926

convicted of having promised to deliver secret french documents to major schwartzkoppen german military attaché in paris when evidence pointing toward major ferdinand walsin esterhazy as the real traitor was brought forward several times in succeeding years and silenced the case became a major political issue throughout france in 1906 dreyfus was cleared and reinstated as a major his innocence was proved conclusively in 1930 upon publication of the schwartzkoppen papers 4 émile zola 1840 1902 french novelist and vigorous dreyfusard whose j'accuse 1898 openly and violently denounced everyone

germany in default on deliveries of timber and coal french and belgian_troops occupied germany's industrial ruhr district early in 1923 the german government suspended deliveries and supported the area's population in a policy of passive resistance which met with reprisals from the occupying authorities the dawes plan led to the departure of the last french and belgian soldiers from the ruhr on

extends the opportunity of commercial intercourse with a country to all nations on equal terms 11 published in 1922 it might appear that this_year's two peace_prize winners are widely separated not only in the geographical sense by the ocean which separates their two countries but also in the area of their activities and in the nature of their contributions to the cause that concerns us here one is a man of the world engaged in practical politics the other a man of the church a soldier of the spirit but just as it is said that all roads lead to the eternal city so it can also truthfully be claimed that many are the roads which must be followed and many the means which must be explored if the human race is to attain the great and sacred goal which is eternal peace among nations to achieve this goal practical efforts to promote better collaboration in commercial and economic affairs such as in developing easier and faster means of communication and similar efforts in cultural affairs can and should go hand in hand with purely political efforts but the steps that are taken and the progress which is made are unfortunately not always readily apparent the obstacles to be surmounted the opposition to be overcome are formidable in magnitude and number and the problems are not just of a practical or political character they are frequently to be found in the minds of men in the warlike mentality which is so tragically passed on from one generation to the next a legacy which our own generation in spite of its fearsome experiences has failed to disclaim alfred_nobel himself had no illusions as to the difficulties and the complexity of work for peace for this reason he placed no strict limitations on his peace_prize any serious and noble effort to advance the cause of peace could qualify at a very early date he perceived the value of an international association of states such as we now have in the league of nations he had already formulated this thought in january 1893 when in a letter to bertha_von suttner he outlined his ideas for a peace_prize which might be awarded to the person or organization making the greatest contribution toward the attainment of the ideal of universal peace1 it is thus in full accord with alfred_nobel's conception of work for peace that no restrictions are imposed on the manner in which it is performed nor can it be otherwise for in this work both hand and heart are required how wonderful it now is to see all the world's might united in advancing this great cause and how happy we are that this work can bridge not only the narrow national_frontiers of our little part of the world but also the vast expanse separating the continents and even if we could wish that this cooperation had found greater support we cannot lose sight of what has already been accomplished that the league of nations the greatest the most powerful the most remarkable institution acting for peace that the world has ever known has been established thanks to the initiative of the united_states the league of nations that gigantic world monument which president wilson erected in 1918 above the ruins of war and peace2 to the glory of his own_country and for the happiness and salvation of the world the deepest shadow which has so far been cast over the organization is the sad fact that wilson's own_country has not become a member3 fortunately this has not meant that the united_states of america has taken no part in the great international work for peace and understanding which has been conducted during the twelve years since the war time and again the initiative and the cooperation of the u.s.a have left a deep and enduring mark on this work and the pact which bears the name of the man who sits today in our midst exemplifies not only the efforts put forth by the u.s.a but also a sound and conscientious collaboration on the international front for the advancement of peace the movement in favor of the outlawry of war to proclaim war illegal and to label it a crime had gained increasing support in the u.s.a ever_since the end of the world war mr briand france's great champion of peace made a point of choosing a memorable date in the american calendar april 6 1927 the tenth anniversary of the entry of the united_states into the war to declare himself a disciple of that movement if there were any need between these two great democracies the united_states and france to testify more convincingly in favor of peace and to present to the peoples a more solemn example france would be ready publicly to subscribe with the united_states to any mutual engagement tending as between those two countries to outlaw war to use an american expression 4 and on june 20 1927 briand handed to the american ambassador in paris a draft of a treaty of perpetual friendship between the two countries according to the draft the two parties would solemnly declare that they condemned war and renounced it as an instrument of their national policies on the other side of the atlantic frank b kellogg the u.s secretary of state elevated this proposal to the status of the world pact to which we pay_tribute today in the person of its author the government of the united_states is prepared therefore to concert with the government of france with a view to the conclusion of a treaty among the principal powers of the world open to signature by all nations condemning war and renouncing it as an instrument of national policy in favor of the pacific settlement of international disputes 5 and from this common action emerged the pact that today binds together almost all civilized nations in the world article i of the pact states the following the high contracting parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another seldom has an inscription been as appropriate as that which the town of le havre inscribed on the box holding the gold pen it presented to frank b kellogg as he stepped ashore on his way to paris to join france and other leading world powers in signing the pact on august 27 1928 si vis pacem para pacem we fully realize that a number of countries have made significant reservations with regard to the kellogg_pact and we realize too that a long road remains to be traveled between the signing of the pact and its fulfillment in spirit and in action we realize that theory should not be mistaken for reality and we also realize that the collaboration of all nations of which the kellogg_pact is the great outcome must be extended to fields other than the purely political for however deep and menacing may be the political divergences between nations it is not at all unlikely that differences in the field of commercial and economic politics constitute an equally grave threat to peace the problem of the war debt which still weighs heavily upon economic progress must be resolved finally and effectively and we must in the interest of peace try to counteract with no less vigor than we devote to the fight_against senseless military armament the isolationist policies which can bring only misery and unemployment and which obstruct the free exchange and healthy distribution of world production in these domains too cooperation between all nations is indispensable cooperation based_on an appreciation of its importance for the well being of the entire world we shall not however succeed until our minds and thoughts become attuned to peace until our present mentality is completely transformed archbishop söderblom has said the kellogg_pact is a solemn declaration invaluable if life is brought into conformity with its words delusory if actions contradict its great and noble sentiments and that is the crux of the matter the need to animate this pact as it has been the need for so many other attempts to safeguard peace with the light of the word the truth of the spirit the courage of the will we must bring people to understand that it is not enough to proclaim war to be a crime but that it is necessary for all men to recognize with every sense and emotion that the murder of hundreds of thousands of human_beings to settle an international dispute is no more justifiable no more pardonable than the murder of a single individual to settle some personal quarrel the day said briand in the great speech he delivered at the league of nations last year when children are taught to respect the people of other nations and to seek that which unites men rather_than that which divides them then we shall have no more need of treaties then peace will truly reign among nations 6 archbishop nathan söderblom's great achievement is that he has thrown the power of the spirit into the fight for peace a holder of high ecclesiastical office he understands the enormous importance of the church in this fight the powerful influence which it can bring to bear the christian church has sinned grievously and often against the teaching of him whose first commandment to men was that they should love one another this church surely has a unique opportunity now of creating that new attitude of mind which is necessary if peace between nations is to become reality peace in the heart and peace on earth make up the task of the church so long as it bears the name of the prince of peace the spirit of geneva said robert de traz7 dedicated to the salvation of mankind but seeing it only in its universal aspect is now seen to pervade ecclesiastical circles shattered by war born of christianity the spirit of peace now returns to it today it no_longer inspires politicians economists and lawyers alone it seeks to penetrate into the human mind if a new war threatens the churches will not this time bless the guns they will halt the nations in the name of him who called himself the prince of peace at least they say this and they commit_themselves to it and because in 1914 they denied their master more_than twice they now beg mankind for forgiveness in

streams lead toward the sea so we hope and believe that the great work of the hand and of the heart for peace that work which bears the names of kellogg and söderblom will lead irresistibly toward making the spirit of geneva live among the people that spirit of which it is said that even_though still weak disputed even despised at every moment in danger of perishing no catastrophe can destroy

widely separated not only in the geographical sense by the ocean which separates their two countries but also in the area of their activities and in the nature of their contributions to the cause that concerns us here one is a man of the world engaged in practical politics the other a man of the church a soldier of the spirit but just as it is said that all roads lead to the eternal city so it can also truthfully be claimed that many are the roads which must be followed and many the means which must be explored if the human race is to attain the great and sacred goal which is eternal peace among nations to achieve this goal practical efforts to promote better collaboration in commercial and economic affairs such as in developing easier and faster means of communication and similar efforts in cultural affairs can and should go hand in hand with purely political efforts but the steps that are taken and the progress which is made are unfortunately not always readily apparent the obstacles to be surmounted the opposition to be overcome are formidable in magnitude and number and the problems are not just of a practical or political character they are frequently to be found in the minds of men in the warlike mentality which is so tragically passed on from one generation to the next a legacy which our own generation in spite of its fearsome experiences has failed to disclaim alfred_nobel himself had no illusions as to the difficulties and the complexity of work for peace for this reason he placed no strict limitations on his peace_prize any serious and noble effort to

today brings the united_states into first place among those nations whose representatives have received the prize during the past thirty_years previously france had the highest number of prizewinners a total of six while other nations had no more_than two or three as of today seven peace prizes will have gone to america four of them during the last five_years what is true of the other nobel awards is also true of the peace_prize people do not always agree that it is given to the most suitable candidates and no one is more aware of the difficulties involved in the selection than the members of the nobel_committee but i trust everyone will agree that it is only natural that so many peace prizes should have gone to the united_states in recent_years the united_states of america is a world in itself as large as the whole of europe and this world is a great land of peace where war between states either economic or military is unthinkable but the united_states is at the same_time one of the great world powers and economically is now the greatest of all by virtue of this position she influences decisions on war and peace in all corners of the globe we can say in fact that because of this vast economic strength she wields greater power over war and peace than any other country on earth all who yearn for a lasting peace must therefore look to america for help america helped perhaps it would be more correct to say compelled europe to create a league of nations which would provide a firm basis for peaceful coexistence among nations it was a crushing blow that america herself did not join this organization and without doubt her failure to do so contributed largely to the failure of the league of nations to live up to expectations we still see too much of the old rivalries of power politics had the united_states joined she would have been a natural mediator between many of the conflicting forces in europe for america is more interested in peace in europe than in lending her support to any particular country it must be said however that the united_states is not the power for peace in the world that we should have wished her to be she has sometimes let herself drift into the imperialism which is the natural outcome of industrial capitalism in our age in many ways she is typical of the wildest form of capitalist society and this has inevitably left its mark on american politics but america has at the same_time fostered some of the most spirited idealism on earth it may be that this idealism derives its vigor from the squalor and evil produced by social conditions in other words from the contrasts within itself it is certainly an undeniable fact which must strike anyone who knows the country that the american nation has an instinctive and profound faith in what the philosophers of 100 or 150 years_ago used to call human perfectability the capacity to become more and more perfect it is a faith which has provided the foundation for some of our greatest religions and one which has inspired much of the best work for progress it was proclaimed by jesus christ it inspired the work of men like emerson and wergeland1 to the american mind nothing is impossible this attitude applies not only to science and technology but to social forms and conditions as well to an american an ideal is not just a beautiful mirage but a practical reality the implementation of which is every man's duty american social idealism expresses itself as a burning desire to devote work and life to the construction of a more equitable society in which men will show each_other greater consideration in their mutual relations will provide stronger protection to the weak and will offer greater opportunities for the beneficent forces of progress two of the finest representatives of this american idealism are awarded the nobel peace_prize today both have worked assiduously and for many years to revive the ideal of peace and to rekindle the spirit of peace in their own nation and in the whole of mankind in honoring jane_addams we also pay_tribute to the work which women can do for peace and fraternity among nations the old concept implied that woman was the source of nearly all sin and strife on earth popular tradition and poetry would also have it that women were frequently the cause of the wars waged by kings and nations i know of only one legend to the contrary the story of the sabine women who threw themselves between their roman fathers and brothers and their sabine husbands in modern times the poets starting with goethe ibsen and bjørnson 2 have seen women in a different light in their eyes women reflect the highest and purest moral standards of society and no man has placed greater faith in the work of women for the cause of peace than did bjørnson it is this new position acquired by women in the society of our time their new independence in relation to men that gave us reason to anticipate that they would constitute a new force in the work for peace bjørnson seemed to see women as bringing the spirit of calm to the tumult of battle with the prayer that love should prevail over the passion to kill and to believe that when women obtained power in society and in the state the very spirit of war must die we must nevertheless acknowledge that women have not altogether fulfilled the hopes we have placed in them they have allowed too much scope to the old morality of men the morality of war in practical politics we have seen too little of that love that warm maternal feeling which renders murder and war so hateful to every woman but fortunately we have seen something of this feminine will which revolts against war whenever women have organized they have always included the cause of peace in their program and jane_addams combines all the best feminine qualities which will help us to develop peace on earth twice in my life once more_than twenty_years ago and now again this year i have had the pleasure of visiting the institution where she has been carrying on her lifework in the poorest districts of chicago among polish italian mexican and other immigrants she has established and maintained the vast social organization centered in hull house3 here young and old alike in fact all who ask receive a helping_hand whether they wish to educate themselves or to find work when you meet miss addams here be it in meeting room workroom or dining room you immediately become poignantly aware that she has built a home and in it is a mother to one and all she is not one to talk much but her quiet greathearted personality inspires confidence and creates an atmosphere of goodwill which instinctively brings out the best in everyone from this social work often carried on among people of different nationalities it was for her only a natural step to the cause of peace she has now been its faithful spokesman for nearly a quarter of a century little by little through no attempt to draw_attention by her work but simply through the patient self sacrifice and quiet ardor which she devoted to it she won an eminent place in the love and esteem of her people she became the leading woman in the nation one might almost say its leading citizen consequently the fact that she took a stand for the ideal of peace was of special significance since millions of men and women looked up to her she could give a new strength to that ideal among the american people and when the need became more pressing than ever she inspired american women to work for peace on an international level we shall always remember as one of the finest and most promising events during the last great war the gathering of women from all over the world even from enemy countries who met to discuss and pursue common action for world peace the initiative for this conference which took_place at the hague in april of 1915 came from the dutch women and it is only right to pay_tribute to the memory of dr aletta jacobs4 who stood at their head but it was natural that they should ask miss addams to come to preside over their conference from the moment the war_broke out she had launched a propaganda campaign with the aim of uniting america and the other neutral countries to end the war and had succeeded in forming a great organization of women to support this program so it was that she energetically opposed the entry of the united_states into the war she held fast to the ideal of peace even during the difficult hours when other considerations and interests obscured it from her compatriots and drove them into the conflict throughout the whole war she toiled for a peace that would not engender a new war becoming as she did so the spokesman for the pacifist women of the world sometimes her views were at odds with public_opinion both at home and abroad but she never gave in and in the end she regained the place of honor she had had before in the hearts of her people devotion to a cause always inspires respect and in her devotion miss addams is truly american this very year she joined with representatives of countries all over the world to call for general disarmament in nicholas murray butler president of the great columbia university in new_york the nobel_committee sees a man who shares the qualities of jane_addams his work for peace began at about the same_time as hers some twenty_five years_ago and it has been distinguished by tireless energy and a zeal almost without parallel he is one of those men who give themselves completely to anything they undertake always ready always willing nothing can discourage him or sap his strength nothing can disturb the serene smile in his eyes and his personality is infectious for he communicates courage vigor and confidence to all who work with him he has a great talent for putting others to work and for finding the right job for the right man if there be a man who can truly be called american then butler is that man a greathearted worker and a splendid organizer i have watched him at work at his university and i have seen him preside over a peace conference wherever he goes an aura of vitality seems to follow him it was another winner of the nobel peace_prize the frenchman d'estournelles_de constant who drew him into the work for peace and who first oriented his efforts in 1907 he was elected_president of the american branch of the conciliation internationale which d'estournelles himself had founded while d'estournelles chief aim had been reconciliation between france and germany and between france and england butler adopted a much wider program and as a result the american branch rapidly became the most_important in the whole organization in my opinion it would be difficult to name another peace organization which has persisted in such effective tenacious and steady work for the cause of peace as has this american group under the presidency of butler with typically american practical common sense he saw the need to establish this work on a sound economic footing and it was primarily his influence that prompted carnegie to establish the very substantial endowment for international peace in 19105 butler himself became president of one of its sections that concerned with intercourse and education which he finally linked to the american branch of the conciliation internationale and later he became head of the endowment itself but throughout these years the kind of work he did remained basically the same we can see at once that all this activity has been directed by a man of great knowledge and wide views he has not confined himself merely to empty generalities but on the contrary has raised all the questions which might imperil international peace he has had experts sent to examine potential causes of war in the balkans the far east and mexico and so has succeeded in compiling invaluable reports on a number of political danger spots his main concern has always been the gathering of information on all kinds of international conditions and relationships and his great ambition has been to create an international mind the will and the ability to examine every question from an international point of view which never forgets that in any dispute each of the two combatants may have his justification and consequently the right to a fair hearing he himself has never failed in this obligation and he has done more_than most to draw_attention to such a duty in all parts of the world it is also worthy of mention that on one occasion four or five_years ago he intervened in an actual situation securing results that delighted many friends of peace when brind made his famous speech in april 1927 proposing that france and the united_states should agree to outlaw war his appeal found no response in america until butler took it up and successfully rallied public_opinion to it he himself had discussed the matter with briand beforehand and the work he then did6 drew america into the negotiations which in the following year resulted in what we know as the kellogg_pact people may hold differing opinions as to the practical effect of this pact but it is at least a living proof of the development of the peace idea it was no more_than a just recognition that briand should send particular words of thanks to butler on the day the pact was signed and it is only natural that in addition to briand himself two other nobel peace_prize winners sir austen chamberlain and elihu root should have strongly supported butler's candidacy for this_year's prize in the case of peace workers such as butler and jane_addams it is often difficult to point to tangible and manifest results of their actions or to particular events in political life with which their names may be associated those_who set their sights on awakening and educating public_opinion cannot expect swift victories of the kind that win popular acclaim consequently it has come about and perhaps had to come about that the peace prizes have passed over such patient pioneers as these and have gone to statesmen holding governmental positions of authority who had the power to transform efforts for peace into treaties and other political measures but a statesman and the policies he represents reflect the social and intellectual conditions of his country if his work is to endure it must have a solidly developed foundation enterprises for peace such as the league of nations the locarno treaty or the kellogg_pact would have been impossible if they had not been backed by a desire and will for peace on the part of powerful sections of the people in all countries certainly there are profound forces which shape the progress of society and of the state forces which inevitably affect what we call peace policy new interests and new ideals are born which direct nations toward new forms of organization the idea of international peace and justice can perhaps never attain ultimate victory until our entire society is reconstructed upon a new foundation such is the context of progress in all fields of society but any new idea which grows and prospers always needs men who can give it a clear and conscious form nothing in society ever moves forward of its own momentum progress must always be sustained by the human thought human will and human action to transmute the need into a

work for international peace as in other fields of human endeavor there must be a division of labor among others a division of labor between technicians and educators mr arthur_henderson is one of the technicians a statesman devising plans for peace and leading the way for their acceptance norman_angell the recipient of the nobel peace_prize for 1933 is one of the educators one of those_who instruct public_opinion who pave the way for reforms which the statesmen attempt to carry_out his share in this educational task has been original and influential ralph norman_angell lane is a farmer's son from norfolk who will be sixty years old next boxing day1 his health was never strong and in his youth he lived several years in california thus he established contacts with the united_states and with american public_opinion which he has kept up throughout life he became a journalist and when first i met him now more_than twenty_years ago he was the business manager of the paris edition of the daily mail and had been living in france for some years his intimate knowledge of public_opinion in three of the big powers of the world has qualified him superbly for his chosen work i remember that he was rather insistent on the point that he was not on the editorial staff of that jingo paper he explained to me that his job was to buy paper and printer's ink for it but he added with a little smile he was on very good terms with the newspaper king lord northcliffe2 and thus i can manage when occasion offers to get some sensible stuff into his papers norman_angell was then already a famous writer his first book patriotism under three flags3 which appeared in 1903 and which discussed problems rising out of the south_african war had passed quite unnoticed then in 1909 he published a little book of some hundred pages europe's optical illusion4 and he awoke one morning to find himself famous a book's success is more often than not a haphazard thing norman angell's book fell into the hands of lord esher a high court official and a personal friend of king edward5 and lord esher saw to it that this book became known edition followed edition and in the following year of 1910 norman_angell published a new partly revised and considerably expanded edition entitled the great illusion which appeared in tens if not hundreds of thousands and was translated_into twenty_five foreign languages what was still more remarkable lord esher's discreet but efficient propaganda also won over a wealthy man to norman angell's ideas he was persuaded to donate a large sum of money to the garton foundation so named for the donor6 with the objective of making norman angell's ideas known through research lectures and publications what is the greet illusion which norman_angell wishes to explode in few and therefore insufficient words it is this war is a quite inadequate method for solving international disputes war does_not carry any advantage not even to the victors least of all any economic advantage this thesis the author supports by applying some representative tests if war a victorious war were economically advantageous then the citizens of those big powers which have built their world empires through victorious wars would be better off than the citizens of small pacific nations statistics of capital and revenues in these two categories of nations furnish proof that this is not so dutch stocks and swedish swiss stocks and norwegian stand higher on the world's exchanges than those of great_britain of france of germany not to mention those of czarist russia does war increase trade asks norman_angell and his answer is in a world of division of labor the products constitute wealth only if you can get rid of them war which impoverishes your clients in the victorious as well as in the defeated nation war which hinders if it does_not strangle trade tends to make merchandise valueless at any_rate it takes away the profit most convincing of all is the sixth chapter of the book entitled the indemnity futility here i want to make a little jump in my chronology last year twenty four years after the first edition of his book norman_angell made an exceptional experiment he reedited his book of 1910 adding an introduction and a postscript nearly sixty years old he subjected the work of his youth to his own revision and judgment some chapters he rewrote not to modify them but to summarize and bring them up to date but there was one chapter which was printed word for word as in 1910 it was this sixth chapter the indemnity futility norman_angell tells_us that when the book was published for the first time part of his contention in fact the entire basic theory of this chapter was made the object of severe criticism indeed it had been rejected entirely by both an english and a french economist their criticism had shaken his belief in his own theories enough to make him qualify his assertions in later editions now after we have experienced what mr keynes has called the economic consequences of the peace7 norman_angell thinks that he can reprint word for word what he said in 1910 namely that it is futile to impose a war indemnity such indemnity is simply unpayable unless the creditor nation is willing to receive it in the form of imports and against this form of payment citizens will raise violent protest calling it dumping unfair competition a violation of the very principles of the protectionist duties imposed for their benefit the tragedy or tragicomedy of reparations has proved the validity of norman angell's views he had based his argument on the consequences so tragic for the economy of victorious germany of the five milliard gold francs war indemnity paid by france after the franco german war of 1870 1871 his argument was rejected by the experts now the illusion bubble of the 225 milliard gold marks indemnity to be paid by germany has burst before our very eyes now we all think norman_angell quite right he states it coolly without scorn or haughtiness just with a somewhat tired disillusioned smile on his pale face i take up my chronological thread and return to the first edition of his chief work the great illusion in its turn created certain illusions in those_who read the book superficially or who only heard about it because norman_angell had proved war to be foolish to be a bad business proposition many believed that he had said there would be no more war in europe against this misinterpretation norman_angell at once protested with the greatest heat he asked why then do i pursue my fight_against war indeed why should pacifists continue their frequently thankless and unpopular work if they believe that war will never occur any more rational people do not try to break down an open door the final chapter of the great illusion presents a convincing plea for a change in foreign_policy from that of a war policy to one of international cooperation and peace if this is not made war he says will be inevitable the fact that we are living in a world of international interdependence makes it imperative that we organize the international community of nations accordingly basing the community on the common interests which bind nations together relinquishing the principle of isolated national defence providing collective security through common effort by erecting an international authority which can replace the prevailing international anarchy norman_angell is a great writer and journalist he possesses the greatest gift of the pamphleteer the gift of saying the same thing again and again but in new ways with new and apt illustrations he has been compared with swift and with cobden8 that is high praise but well deserved praise he is fundamentally different from both of them he does_not have swift's cutting contempt nor has he cobden's persuasive and magnetic eloquence which drew tens of thousands to his meetings and carried the cause of free trade to victory in less_than a generation both in england and in europe alas for all too short a time norman_angell towers as high as swift or cobden but his is another kind of genius he is not a poet as was swift nor a preacher as was cobden norman_angell speaks to the intellect he is cool and clear he has a profound belief in reason and in rationalism he is convinced that at long last reason will prevail when we succeed in sweeping away the mists of illusion and intellectual error it is this belief which supported him through the world war through the reparations tragedy and through the bitter postwar disappointments and he has had the courage of his convictions immediately after the outbreak of the world war he founded with e d morel ramsay macdonald charles trevelyan and arthur ponsonby the union of democratic control9 the first plank of whose platform was the introduction of public and parliamentary control of foreign_policy in constitutional practice he and his comrades believed in the educative influence of public discussion thus could the mists of illusion be dissipated in his book of 1915 prussianism and its destruction he demonstrated that war was inefficient as a means of eradicating human error you cannot kill ideas with bullets and he showed that prussianism militarism was not a phenomenon indigenous to germany only of course he was denounced as pro german as were his colleagues norman_angell also traveled widely in the united_states giving lectures and leading study groups all the while fighting for his ideas he came into close contact_with president wilson and had a share in the development of wilson's plan for a league of nations after the war he criticized the peace settlement particularly its economic stipulations from 1929 to 1931 he sat in the house of commons as a member of the labor party behind mr henderson in the last few years in books and lectures he has concentrated his efforts on attempts to clarify certain problems of social psychology in his unseen assassins 1932 he unmasks the prejudices and the misconceptions in the human mind on which selfish interests and ambitious politicians can play in order to lead the people to the perilous paths of the policy of force and war i should like also to mention two chapters he wrote last year for a book i have seen in bookstore windows here in oslo the intelligent man's way to the prevention of war10 it is mankind's deep tragedy that it so rarely sees reality we all have in our eyes the splint of the goblin looking glass as sigrid undset has called one of her books 11 we see what we desire to see not naked reality or we have before our eyes mists stereotypes inherited from our parents from our grandparents even from our great grandparents intellectually we are wearing the cast off clothes of our ancestors and we do not see we do not understand that they no_longer fit us and our statesmen who of necessity are obliged to work with the material which the people through public_opinion offer them toil in the same mist in the same cast off clothing though to be just many of them taken individually have their eyes open above the mists time and again norman_angell returns to this metaphor the mist we read on the first page of the last edition of the great illusion this book endeavors to clear away the mists which prevent so many from seeing the road few people if any have done as much as sir norman to remove the splint of the goblin looking glass in our eyes to clear away the mists which prevent us from seeing the road we should travel he has done it and he goes on doing it because he has a profound and warm belief in what he calls in one of his books the potential rationalism of mankind let_us hope that his optimism may be vindicated 1 boxing day in england the first weekday after christmas gets its name from the practice of giving christmas boxes or gifts to postmen etc ralph norman_angell lane born on december

present a biography of our guest and friend mr arthur_henderson in this respect i shall be very brief as a member of the house of commons since 1903 with very few interruptions he has for more_than thirty_years belonged to the political life of great_britain in the first place his political activity has been connected with the british labor party the progress of which he has not only followed but to which he has contributed significantly he was parliamentary leader of the labor group from 1908 to 1910 and from 1914 to 1917 and for many years until recently when at his own desire he was replaced he was secretary_general of his party it may safely be said that politically he is deeply rooted in the labor movement and he has always represented the broad principal views of his party whose confidence he has possessed in a remarkable degree our interest in the man of the day takes us however from the part played by domestic politics in his life and work to that taken by foreign politics like those in his own party and even many other british politicians he looked with skepticism upon the line followed in foreign politics which led to the division of europe into two armed camps and which at last drove docile nations into the world catastrophe of 1914 the war of pontius pilate as theodor wolff calls it in his recent work1 because all the statesmen of europe have tried to wash their hands of the black stain of responsibility what a tremendous impression the outbreak of war at that time made even on the leaders is shown by sir edward grey2 who when his praiseworthy efforts to bring_about negotiations at the eleventh hour failed in desperation smote his writing desk with both fists and exclaimed i hate the war since the urgency of the war compelled all british groups to unite for the protection of the home country and the empire we find arthur_henderson a member first in mr asquith's coalition government in 1915 and later in mr lloyd george's war cabinet which however he left in 19173 and this withdrawal from mr lloyd george's cabinet was symptomatic it was the will of peace the desire for peace in him which now found expression he parted company because the government would not allow the british labor party to send representatives to the big socialist conference in stockholm to which mr branting4 had invited friends and enemies undoubtedly his thought and his view at that time coincided with what a man whom i know he rates very highly the well_known editor of the manchester guardian mr c p scott5 wrote as early as 1916 i hate the very thought of the permanent division and hostility in europe and if that is all we have to look forward to i feel as if the future has little interest for me and i had rather get out of it it isn't the material loss or even the prospect necessarily involved of future wars and bloodshed it is the enthronement in europe that is practically in the civilized world of the spirit of hatred and revenge the war bled to an end after four years of untold suffering losses and destruction at last we got peace a peace which was supposed to end the last war but which unfortunately bore more the impress of the spirit which the same mr scott described in 19186 let there be no mistake chauvinism is not dead imperialism is not dead in any of the great european countries since those days when the peace was signed and until today the world has felt the heavy weight of the consequences of that peace in financial and commercial policy sound development has stopped and natural connections between countries are obstructed by countless restrictions prohibitions and exchange difficulties and politically the new era has taken the shape of increasing mutual distrust uncertainty and fear as an institutional counterbalance to this dark side of the peace and as a means of achieving better times stands the league of nations it is our only consolation our best hope its organization and its influence the possibilities for understanding which it can and does bring to all make the league of nations the bulwark from which the attack for happier times of reconciliation and peace may be launched and among the bravest and most faithful on this bulwark we find arthur_henderson in mr macdonald's7 first cabinet from 1924 to 1925 arthur_henderson sat as home secretary but it was also in 1924 that he became a delegate to the assembly of the league of nations sat on the committee of security and disarmament and was elected a member of the committee of twelve which drafted the protocol on these questions and here he took a firm stand declaring that disarmament must be effected before decisions on security and sanctions could be carried_out arthur_henderson became foreign_secretary in macdonald's second cabinet in 1929 and his authority his influence his opportunities for effective action were naturally increased during these years he invariably appeared personally as first delegate of great_britain at both the assembly and the council meetings of the league where his desire and determination to do something positive was very marked so when in may 1931 he was appointed president of the great disarmament conference all those_who hoped for and believed in positive results from this conference considered it a strong guarantee that above_all others he the foreign_secretary of powerful britain had been chosen for this important post in the autumn of 1931 however macdonald's government fell and arthur_henderson was for several years out of british politics but his personal reputation was so high and faith and confidence in him so great that a strong and universal demand kept him in his post as president of the disarmament conference the world has watched him work in this capacity throughout these difficult years witnessing his untiring struggle and his courageous efforts his political position of course had been weakened by the fall of the government he was president of the disarmament conference but not even a member of the delegation which his own_country sent to the conference there he stands in the struggle and in the work itself a lonely man the words of bjørnson to émile zola during his fight for justice in the dreyfus case8 come to mind a single man against millions the proudest sight to be seen as president of the disarmament conference arthur_henderson exhibits his best qualities tact and unfailing courtesy prudent reserve and at the same_time the faculty of taking decisive action when necessary he has indestructible endurance and a never ending patience despite indifferent health despite adversity and disappointments he never tires not only during the sessions but even between sessions he keeps in contact_with the various governments and with world opinion not many would have been able to hold out so long not many would even have been strong_enough and still fewer would have possessed the necessary authority if the conference is still alive and if there is still a thin thread of hope it is primarily because of mr arthur_henderson but is the conference alive is there still hope the fair words and promises of the treaty of peace and of the covenant of the league of nations seem to be of scarcely greater importance than those of that scrap of paper of which we once heard so much9 and meanwhile the naval convention10 and other conventions fall to pieces the feeling of unease and desolation increases while rumors that even germany is arming are broadcast to millions of anxious listeners the words let it be the last war and lest we forget belong to the era of twenty_years ago and the men who today hold the fate of the world in their hands may perhaps one day find themselves also in the position of pontius pilate germany is arming well in the divine comedy by our immortal ludvig holberg about the unhappy jeppe11 we find this sentence everybody says that jeppe drinks but nobody asks why jeppe drinks let_us all who now complain that germany also is arming look into our own consciences and ask why germany is arming in the debate in the british house of commons a few days ago mr baldwin12 said on this subject i hope and believe that this debate inaugurated not perhaps with those ideas but with a genuine and rightful desire to get to know the truth in europe may have greater consequences and better consequences than any of us could have thought it may be that an opportunity has been made for a first step once more to bring together the nations of europe and it may be that having learned some wisdom by the deterioration and the degeneration of the conditions of europe in the last few years the voice of wisdom and the voice of peace may prevail all who spoke in the house of commons agreed that the only means of creating peace in europe and security for every_single nation is the limitation of armaments and that germany must share in that work general smuts said in his great speech the other day on british policy today that to achieve this there is only one way and that is to recognize germany's complete equality of status with her fellows and to do so frankly freely and unreservedly 13 yes that is just where the road lies which may bring new life and fresh hope to the disarmament conference the road which leads out of the deadlock which leads forward the road of understanding and of peace arthur henderson's road there is no better there is no other on briand s coffin as a tribute from the heart and as a token of gratitude to him who died in the struggle for international peace and understanding a woman laid a small bunch of spring violets with a slip of paper on which were written these touching words from a mother who has lost much but who still has a son aged eighteen lest our world our community our civilization our future our children perish in a new armageddon every one of us must today remember the violets of this mother maternal love and manhood unite to secure peace throw down the weapons step aside you angryfools bring us bread help us end our common dread help us love each_other it is in these hard times when the freedom of peoples is threatened when free speech and free thought are gagged when force violates justice that in the holy name of freedom peace and understanding between peoples we bring our thanks and our homage to the man who stands firm and faithful believing in the truth of the words of bjørnstjerne_bjørnson the thought of peace is the greatest thought in the world by it human progress shall be tested and around it all efforts for freedom shall rally for the last great struggle after receiving his diploma and medal mr henderson responded to the presentation saying in part14 you were good enough to make special mention mr prime_minister of the disarmament conference you asked is the conference alive is there still hope it would be a sad day not only for us here but for the great masses of humble citizens in all lands if that question had to be answered in the negative as you have stated mr prime_minister i have devoted nearly three years to the work of the disarmament conference it has been a period of anxious and exacting labors for all a period of difficulty and delay and disappointments of hopes deferred but if success has yet to be achieved at least that decisive and heart breaking word failure has not been written and i cannot conceive that it will be allowed to be written 1 theodor wolff der krieg des pontius pilatus zurich 1934 2 edward grey 1862 1933 british

les_prix nobel en 1934 carl_von ossietzky who has been awarded the peace_prize for 1935 belongs to no political party he is not a communist he is not in any sense a conservative indeed one cannot easily pin on him any of the usual political tags if i were asked to give my impression of his personality i should say that he seems to me to be a liberal or if you prefer a liberal of the old school in using this description i do not have in mind economic liberalism but liberalism in a completely different sense a burning love for freedom of thought and expression a firm belief in free competition in all spiritual fields a broad international outlook a respect for values created by other nations and all of these dominated by the theme of peace an account of ossietzky's life is to be found in all the newspapers and i shall not weary you by needless repetition he served in the war as an ordinary soldier but the war had the effect of maturing and crystallizing the pacifist ideas which he had already cherished for a long time when the war ended he threw himself into work for peace in germany he was among those_who formed the movement which took as its slogan no more war he became secretary of the german peace society1 the president of which was mr quidde who was himself subsequently awarded the nobel peace_prize office work however failed to satisfy ossietzky he saw his true vocation as being in journalism and so leaving his job as secretary he cast himself into the fray applying his talents to the public platform as well as to newspapers and periodicals we are told that he is a gifted orator the role in which he is best known however is that of journalist and essayist he is an author of note his style is supple elegant often bitingly witty he covers a large field writing about all aspects of modern politics but his thought is focused above_all on the cause of peace his favorite weapon is the rapier the sudden thrust the lightning parry these characterize his style and in truth there is in him something of the knight a quality which those_who know him have remarked upon and yet we cannot today obtain a true impression of his merit and importance as a journalist simply by reading the articles he has written in the past the work of the journalist is akin to that of the stage artist in that it lives in the present and cannot be re created the sum total of a journalist's work does_not reside in the faded print which you can if you care to take the trouble seek out and read the sum total of the journalist's craft like that of the stage artist lies in the impact it makes on the minds of others at the time the truly great actor lives on in our minds a vivid memory to the end of our days a legend to be passed on to younger generations it is somewhat the same with the journalist we can browse through an old newspaper and read of events with which we were once well acquainted and the words can still evoke some of that nervous tension that vitality and warmth with which they were charged when cast into the maelstrom of the moment but the spark of life is lost for the words belong to their own day but balancing this we have the full force of the testimony of those_who followed him in his fight and who were inspired by it the sources of such testimony are so varied and their number so great that i cannot enumerate them here let_me point to only one noteworthy fact no less_than six previous recipients of the nobel peace_prize have lent their support to ossietzky's candidacy for the award but many people ask has ossietzky really contributed so much to peace has he not become a symbol of the struggle for peace rather_than its champion in my opinion this is not so but even if it were how great is the significance of the symbol in our life in religion in politics in public affairs in peace and war we rally round symbols we understand the power they hold over us moreover as a rallying point a symbol may well be preferable to a personality men can all too often be compared to the hulder the wicked norwegian fairy beautiful when looked at from the front but hollow in the back such is not the case with the symbol because the symbol is born of an idea and is the bearer of an idea it exists through the idea which first created it and reflects it faithfully and without distortion we have among our poems a few lines about a symbol lines which are quoted more and more frequently for that is the great thing and the sublime thing that the banner may wave though the man has to die the symbol certainly has its value but ossietzky is not just a symbol he is something quite different and something much more he is a deed and he is a man it is on these grounds that ossietzky has been awarded the nobel peace_prize and on these grounds alone his candidacy was examined in the same manner as that of all others and the decision was reached according to the same principles if we look_back upon all the men and women who have received the peace_prize over the years we find that they are of widely divergent personalities and views and that the lives of many of them were marked by passion grief and struggle it is quite obvious that the nobel_committee in awarding the prize to these different personalities has neither shared all the opinions which they held nor declared its solidarity with all of their work the wish of the nobel_committee has always been to fulfill its task and its obligation namely to reward work for peace that and nothing else and the nobel_committee has been able to do so because it is totally independent it is not answerable to anyone nor do its decisions commit anyone other than itself in awarding this_year's nobel peace_prize to carl_von ossietzky we are therefore recognizing his valuable contribution to the cause of peace nothing more and certainly nothing less 1 deutsche friedensgesellschaft founded 1892 the nobel peace_prize for 1936 has been awarded to mr carlos saavedra_lamas foreign_minister of the argentine republic the prize has thus been given to a statesman the career and achievements of a statesman must always be examined in the context of his milieu and time and doing so in depth is the nobel_committee's task when it evaluates a statesman's personal contribution to the cause of peace a few words concerning the milieu in which saavedra_lamas has worked will therefore not be out of place saavedra_lamas country argentina occupies a leading position in latin_america a part of the world whose characteristics distinguish it in important respects from the european part where we live for most of latin_america spanish is the common tongue and the roman_catholic faith the common religion the latin american nations are also united by a political bond for all twenty have for a long time enjoyed a republican form of government differing in this fundamental regard from the old europe of before the world war latin_america has accordingly been spared many of the problems which have beset us here it does_not suffer from the problem of nationalism nor is there racial conflict with the indigenous indian population its absence being largely due to the influence and example of the catholic missionaries who approached the so_called primitive peoples in a spirit of understanding finally and this is by no means least important latin_america is not like europe burdened by the problem of overpopulation for there is plenty of space in that young world along with finland our own_country is the least densely populated in europe only one of south america's ten countries uruguay is more heavily peopled than norway and finland and even uruguay has a density of population well below that of sweden the consequence is that frontier disputes in south america never become as acute as they do in europe in fact no other part of the world can boast such amicable settlement of boundary disputes very often achieved by arbitration indeed during the nineteenth century latin_america became established as the home of arbitration in their struggle to free themselves from spanish domination the latin american states had the support of their great sister republic in the north the united_states president monroe in 1823 made his famous declaration that the united_states would not permit any part of american territory to be colonized by a european state1 this declaration was respected and america thus escaped the fate which overtook africa and to a certain extent asia both of which became the scenes of imperialist struggles between rival european powers the idea of a federation or at least of organized cooperation between the american_republics soon arose simón bólivar the liberator was a staunch supporter of this idea and a number of proposals and attempts to form such an association are recorded in the annals of history2 one finally began to take shape in 1889 when united_states secretary of state james g blaine3 called a pan_american conference in washington4 the first of a series which have since taken_place at irregular intervals the eighth conference opened last week in the capital of argentina under the presidency of carlos saavedra_lamas with the passage of time the conferences have built up an organization which is becoming more closely knit the pan_american union has its offices in washington it has studied a number of questions of common interest to the american states among them public health the laws relating to intellectual property and communications including the construction of a pan_american railway which will link all countries in america from south to north the union has also taken a constant interest in matters pertaining to laws for peace such as the development of international conciliation and arbitration in its efforts to create solidarity the union from the very beginning faced a serious problem the relations_between the powerful north american republic on the one hand and the latin american_republics on the other the latter suspected that the pan_american union was merely a convenient cover for the imperialist tendencies of the statesmen in washington blaine himself the originator of the union was in the vanguard of north american imperialism a policy which was subsequently pursued with particular vigor in the caribbean the most pronounced representative of this north american imperialism theodore roosevelt interpreted monroe's declaration of 1823 as conferring a right on the united_states to see to it that the other states of the western hemisphere maintained a well ordered government which would afford security to the north american business men in their economic ventures and financial investments in these countries from the monroe declaration he had extrapolated a monroe doctrine which constituted a potential danger to the independence of these states this interpretation drew sharp opposition from the latin american countries and argentina saavedra_lamas homeland and one of latin america's most powerful and best organized states became the leader in the fight_against intervention it is against this background that we must look at the work of saavedra_lamas he began his career as a university professor and from the university he went into politics in his most_important academic work which has appeared in french la crise de_la codification et la doctrine argentine de droit international he mounts a vigorous attack against the policy of intervention and especially against that form of it which in his opinion had been conceived and practiced by the united_states the change in u.s policy during recent_years at first introduced in a mild form under president hoover and now pursued obviously and consistently under franklin roosevelt5 must be a source of great satisfaction to saavedra_lamas this change has led him to play a more active_part in the work of the pan_american union which is no_longer suspected of being merely a camouflage for north american imperialism i shall not linger over the academic work of saavedra_lamas for it is in the political field that he has made his most valuable contribution he entered political life at a very early_age he was scarcely thirty_years old when he was elected a member of parliament and by 1917 he was already minister of justice and education as you know argentina remained neutral during the world war unlike most of the latin american countries it did not follow the united_states into the conflict nevertheless it was invited along with twelve other neutral countries in europe asia and america to join the league of nations and at the first assembly in 1920 it took a highly distinctive position the argentine delegates asked that the league covenant be amended to admit any nation to membership without prior application and without such admission's being subject to a vote when this proposal was not adopted at once and received no support at all argentina withdrew from the assembly its seat there remaining vacant for many years to come nevertheless argentina continued to send representatives to the international labor conferences6 and in 1928 we find saavedra_lamas not only heading his country's delegation but also being elected_president of the conference in this capacity he had reason to study the institutions of geneva in some detail and so acquired useful preparation for the active_part he was to play in international peace politics after february 1932 when he became argentina's foreign_minister an office which he still holds some months after he had taken up his new ministerial appointment a bitter war_broke out between argentina's neighbors bolivia and paraguay7 this war has constantly claimed his attention he deployed his efforts in three different but converging directions he was learned in international_law he was acquainted through some firsthand experience with the existing international organizations the league of nations and the pan_american union and he was familiar with the particular position maintained by the united_states on questions of war and peace so he made a comprehensive attempt to coordinate these three different factors like the logically thinking latin he is he began by formulating a theoretical expression of his ideas working out his antiwar_pact during his very first year as foreign_minister its first two articles express in slightly modified form the same principles of international_law for which the united_states has tried to gain recognition first the condemnation of all forms of aggressive war the central point of the kellogg briand pact 8 and second the refusal to recognize any territorial expansion or change of boundary unless effected by peaceful_means the so_called stimson doctrine which un der president hoover secretary of state henry l stimson had formulated during the manchurian conflict in 19329 and which was afterwards endorsed in the special_session of the league of nations assembly called as a result of that dispute thus did saavedra_lamas seek to secure the invaluable support of the united_states for his pact both the kellogg_pact and the stimson doctrine are simply declarations that is to say of purely theoretical nature saavedra_lamas antiwar_pact goes further its article 3 requires the states not involved in a given conflict in which one or more states violate the obligations stipulated in articles 1 and 2 to maintain a common and united attitude and to employ the political legal and economic means provided by international_law to put an end to the conflict they shall have recourse to the influence of public_opinion but shall never resort to intervention either diplomatic or armed subject to any commitments they may have assumed under other agreements this last reservation clearly refers to sanctions stipulated by the league of nations covenant article 4 outlines a conciliation procedure which all signatory nations undertake to follow in settling the dispute the antiwar_pact therefore tries to steer a middle course between the system of the kellogg_pact and the stimson doctrine which is satisfied to enunciate principles and the far more rigid system laid_down in the league of nations covenant the pact rejects neither system but opens the way to collaboration between those nations which so far have preferred the first system especially the united_states and the states which have favored the second the member states of the league of nations his efforts to secure acceptance of his pact have proved saavedra_lamas to be an astute and farsighted diplomat he first obtained the signatures of six latin american states at a solemn ceremony which he shrewdly arranged in rio de janeiro on october 10 1933 by this step he won the powerful support of brazil the largest of the south american states which had quit the league of nations ten_years before two months later saavedra_lamas won approval of the pact from all the american states at a special_session of the seventh pan_american conference in montevideo u s secretary of state cordell_hull was present at this conference as a personal guarantor so to speak of the new policy which the united_states had inaugurated toward its sister nations on the american continent that same year 1933 saavedra_lamas had succeeded in persuading his government to change its attitude toward the league of nations from which argentina had withdrawn thirteen years previously he was now able to inform the secretariat in geneva that henceforth argentina wished to play an active_part in the work of the league of nations and since as everyone knows there is greater joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety nine who have no need to repent10 argentina too received its reward it was immediately elected to the council of the league where it kept its seat for the prescribed three years which ended with the opening of last september's session the antiwar_pact was officially presented to the league of nations council in january 1934 and was given a reception that must surely have delighted its author the pact has since been signed by eleven nations outside america including norway and to date five of these have ratified it we can safely assume then that saavedra_lamas regards his pact as a kind of supplement to the league of nations covenant and as a primary means of bringing countries outside the league of nations into its work to promote peace and prevent war by imposing less rigid demands on them than those prescribed in the league's covenant we have evidence of his attitude in the fact that he has submitted his pact to the commission set_up by the assembly of the league of nations last september to investigate improved ways and means of implementing the principles set_forth in the covenant there may well be a question of whether saavedra_lamas pact will be of decisive_importance in the solution of this great problem the pact becomes operative only when a war has already started and the vital problem in the prevention of war is to find ways to intervene with peacemaking procedures before the storm of war breaks when the argentine antiwar_pact was submitted to the league council on january 18 1934 british foreign_minister sir john simon 11 took the opportunity to point out that the pact was of particular interest since the council had to deal during the same session with a serious conflict precisely in that part of the world occupied by most of the signatory powers needless to say saavedra_lamas had been aware of this fact all along paraguay although among the first states to sign the pact had never ratified it and bolivia did not ratify it until july 1 1935 so saavedra_lamas was unable in the case of these two warring nations to invoke the pact officially he had to bide his time but in may of 1935 he took the very course of action dictated by his own pact approaching the brazilian chilean and peruvian diplomatic representatives in buenos_aires about setting in motion a common mediatory operation a conciliation commission was set_up composed of representatives from argentina from the three countries already contacted and from the united_states and uruguay under the chairmanship of saavedra_lamas himself the foreign ministers of both bolivia and paraguay were persuaded to take part in the commission's negotiations and by the twelfth of june 1935 two protocols had been signed which brought hostilities to an end the work was later completed when the two belligerents accepted a final settlement stipulating that any disagreement concerning the implementation of the peace treaty should be resolved by the permanent court of international justice at the hague it must be recognized that the principles underlying saavedra_lamas antiwar_pact have stood a practical test on south american soil and under his personal leadership as foreign_minister and leader of the argentine delegation saavedra_lamas participated in the recent assembly of the league of nations in recognition of his work for peace the assembly elected him its president in his opening address he alluded to the fact that the six american states whose work of conciliation he had headed had succeeded in negotiating an end to the war in south america and that two of the six the united_states and brazil were not members of the league of nations he added the possibility therefore exists in a concrete case demanding mediation of winning the cooperation of nations outside our league i see this as a significant signpost for the diplomacy of peace we must regard it not as an isolated or exceptional occurrence but as one which will become the rule in making this statement saavedra_lamas has set a task for the future he is still a man in the prime of life his recent achievements in the politics of peace entitle us to hope that his unusual energy and singleness of purpose will enable him to contribute even more to the creation of a truly lasting peace between nations 1 james monroe 1758 1831 u.s.president 1817 1825 whose

statesmen who occupied leading positions during the world war were so deeply struck by the deprivation of human life and economic resources by the futility of war as a social institution and by its amorality that they became convinced pacifists and throughout the rest of their lives spared no effort to prevent such a calamity from ever again overtaking mankind two of the three are dead woodrow_wilson and aristide_briand the nobel_committee has already honored them both with the alfred_nobel prize today the committee takes pleasure in presenting the prize to the third viscount cecil of chelwood perhaps better known by his original name lord_robert cecil it can perhaps be said of wilson and briand that they had some points of contact_with pacifist ideas wilson in his religious puritan tradition briand in the radical socialism of his youth i doubt very much whether any parallel can be found in the case of lord cecil either in his traditions or in his background or in his prewar career i_am more inclined to believe that his revulsion to war was aroused only and entirely through his intimate contact_with the war and his experiences as under secretary of state for foreign_affairs and minister of blockade1 and that it was these which first led him to consider the problem of the abolition of war and so to devote all his efforts to bring nearer the solution which to him appeared to be the right one think of his background and traditions the cecil family is one of the oldest and most distinguished among the english landed aristocracy his father the marquess of salisbury was for nearly twenty_years the leader of the conservative party and for most of this time prime minister2 in foreign_affairs he accepted the legacy of disraeli3 and continued britain's imperialist policy in his early twenties the young lord_robert cecil became a private secretary to his father at that time prime_minister and foreign_secretary he fully shared his father's political and high church views it seems highly improbable that either in hatfield or in the circles in which lord_robert moved in london pacifism should at any time have been discussed except perhaps with a shrug of the shoulders for serious realistic men cannot afford the luxury of such childish dreams being a younger son lord_robert decided to earn a living by following a legal career he developed into a skilled advocate and in due course became a queen's counsel in 1906 when he was in his early forties he was elected to parliament and took his place on the conservative benches under the leadership of his cousin arthur balfour4 although his rise to prominence was not rapid his reputation grew steadily and he won recognition as an able orator and jurist but in 1915 when asquith5 under the pressure of war formed a coalition government cecil became under secretary of state at the foreign office under sir edward grey6 the following year when lloyd george7 succeeded in overthrowing his chief and created his war ministry with a program of war to the bitter end cecil became minister of blockade one of the most exposed positions in the government it was in the course of these war years and especially during his collaboration with the wise and admirable edward grey that cecil first encountered the problem of pacifism it presented itself in the special guise which it had at that time assumed the question of a league of nations the idea was old but during the war it acquired a distinctive form and cecil had a large share in its shaping he toiled over the question and no_doubt had many a struggle with it before he could clearly grasp all its implications and consider himself fully and confidently master of the problem it is fascinating to follow cecil's evolution as a pacifist and internationalist during the two decades between his wartime conversion and the present day i deliberately use the religious term conversion for clearly lord cecil is of a fundamentally religious temperament of the high church episcopalian stamp listening to him speak from the rostrum is often like listening to a venerable bishop preaching the revealed truth but he also has other strings to his bow in addition to that of the preacher's he is a skillful lawyer a quick witted debater and when the occasion demands a shrewd tactician his tall now somewhat bowed figure is imposing but even when he jests and smiles one can always sense an underlying earnestness of purpose the conversion from his youthful indifference to the problem of peace to the profound conviction of its central importance which he now holds in maturity has been perhaps the most momentous experience of his life what inhibitions and innate prejudices has he not had to conquer for no man can ever completely cast off the influences of childhood and youth the twenty_years during which cecil has fought for pacifism and for the league of nations are marked by many instances when these inhibitions have emerged to lead him to a self contradictory position there is much truth in what a witty irishman has said of him lord_robert stands with one foot in the middle ages and the other in the league of nations but he has been true to his newfound conviction that is the important thing and this fact redounds doubly to his credit precisely because he has had to resolve this conflict within himself if we examine his purely intellectual attitude toward the league of nations problem we cannot but marvel at the clarity with which he formulated the essential points of his program at the very outset and at the consistency with which he has adhered to them despite storm and stress on november 12 1918 the day following the armistice he spoke at the university of birmingham about plans for a league of nations he rejoiced that the war was over and that victory had been won but he strongly emphasized the responsibility which the victory imposed on the victors this responsibility was to construct a lasting peace and to create an instrument for international cooperation which might safeguard the permanence of peace he called upon the allies to resist any temptation to exploit their victory to gain mastery for themselves and appealed to them to create instead a league of nations for all nations a league of independent nations not a superstate the principal foundation of this new league was not to be legal institutions such as courts of law or arbitration these should be only the auxiliaries the practical instruments sustaining the dynamic force upon which the league of nations should rest a vigilant and informed public_opinion that would demand a peaceful_solution of disputes by legal judgment or arbitration if possible but in any case by negotiation and mediation and this public_opinion should be given every chance to speak out whenever dispute arose the crux of the whole system was therefore that the states should agree not to resort to arms not to go to war as the new expression had it but to bind themselves to delay and discussion under the watchful eye of public_opinion cecil foresaw that governments would reserve the right to insist on unanimity in all decisions that they would not relinquish their liberum veto but he said since the important thing is to secure delay and open discussion that is to say time to enable public_opinion to act and information to instruct it this is not a serious objection to the proposal here speaks an english parliamentarian who knows that such a system has preserved his country from revolution and has vouchsafed its peaceful development for well nigh three centuries he hopes that other nations will follow suit if a nation should break its promise by failing to delay action thus preventing negotiation or by going to war before allowing a reasonable respite then the other nations must employ military and economic sanctions against it lord_robert the minister of blockade during the war attached particular weight to the economic weapon he spoke of disarmament as a necessary measure but at that time this decisive component of the system still lay in the back of his mind rather he strongly emphasized the importance of harmonious international cooperation which he in complete accord with the ideas of his close friend general smuts8 wished to entrust to the league of nations in order to make the latter a permanent and working instrument and so even then we already have a clear formulation of cecil's concept of the league of nations organization and of its possibilities in the period which followed he returned to these essential points again and again the first problem was to secure the acceptance of the covenant of the new league by all the nations he was in complete agreement with wilson's conviction that the covenant must form an integral part of the peace treaty itself this was undoubtedly right it would have been politically and psychologically unwise to leave the covenant to be dealt with at some international conference specially called to establish the league in that event we should not in all probability have got a league at all certainly not a satisfactory one but it was a high price to pay for serious complications and setbacks followed unfortunately we seldom get anything for nothing and nowhere is this more true than in politics i shall not expatiate on cecil's role in the drafting of the covenant suffice it to say that he played a decisive part both as lawyer and as politician i will only add in passing that his conservative tradition came into play on just one occasion he insisted that only the great_powers should be represented in the council of the league its most_important organ especially with respect to political questions he saw the league as a development and continuation of the old european concert but he soon allowed himself to be persuaded that this would be wrong and he has since completely abandoned this view during the first three years of the league's existence from 1920 to 1923 cecil figured prominently in its activities he had left lloyd george's ministry immediately after the war and was not among the british delegates to these three assemblies but general smuts who had become his close friend asked him to represent south_africa in the assembly this was indeed fortunate for he could act with a great measure of freedom i wonder whether these three years were not among the happiest in lord cecil's political and international career it was quite clear to him from the very beginning that the league was not a perfect or immutable instrument it had to be nursed developed and made to grow both quantitatively in its membership and qualitatively in the efficiency of its operation lord cecil stood in those early years at the head of the progressive wing of the league it is interesting to observe how he systematically took up the points from the program outlined in his birmingham speech of 1918 and tried to put them into_practice above_all he wanted to order the league's work in such a way that it would be pursued in the full light of publicity so that it could be followed stimulated and criticized by public_opinion and by that most_important disseminator of public_opinion the press with the support of delegates from some of the smaller powers not least i_am glad to say the nordic states foremost among whose representatives were hjalmar branting and fridtjof_nansen he forced through the resolution that the assembly should meet annually that it should be a fundamental rule that the meetings both plenary and in committee should be held in public lastly and most_important of all he managed to introduce something of an innovation in international politics the assembly's sessions were to begin each year with a general debate this is a formal debate based_on the secretary general's annual report but any subject whatsoever of an international character can be brought to discussion the assembly thus became a free tribune it is true that not always indeed too seldom does a debate lead to genuine understanding based_on an exchange of views with questions and answers all too often the general debate deteriorates as is also sometimes the case with debates on the speech from the throne in our parliament to a series of unrelated declarations on various questions but there have been times when the assembly has suddenly been ignited by a spark which has brought real fire into the debate it was cecil who on the third day of the first assembly november 17 1920 opened the general debate his speech9 was truly notable and i should like to cite some of the points he made he talked first and at length of the necessity to rouse public_opinion to work with for and through the league it was then that he coined a phrase which became not only a slogan but indeed a program publicity is the very lifeblood of the league of nations but he then went on to speak of the fundamental moral principles which must govern the work of the league the words he uttered are remarkable coming from a conservative politician from one of the great_powers unfortunately they were also prophetic do not let_us be afraid of our power let_us go on from strength to strength it is not by doing too much that the league is in any danger the one danger that threatens the league is that it may gradually sink down into a position of respectable mediocrity and useless complication with the diplomatic machinery of the world we must be ready to take a bold line in the great work of reconciliation and pacification that lies before us he concluded his speech with a few personal words which no one who heard them is likely to forget i stand before you as a substitute of general smuts think of that general smuts not so many years_ago was one of the most redoubtable and successful commanders of the forces of the boer nation when they were in arms against the british empire and i was the son of the prime_minister who conducted the war on_behalf of the british empire and yet it now comes about that the general of the boers goes to the son of the british prime_minister and asks him to appear before the assembly of the league of nations as the best exponent of the general's views on international subjects how has that result come about not by timidity not by shrinking from a bold action but by a great act of trust in the boer people an act which i do not hesitate to say at the moment seemed to me rash and perhaps premature but which has more_than justified itself by its results he is of course referring to campbell bannerman's10 dissolution in 1906 of the emergency government imposed on south_africa after the war and the granting of self rule as a dominion surely cecil continued that is an example to us do not let_us shrink from even strong measures of pacification and reconciliation believe me they will justify themselves in the future i will say to this assembly with all the emphasis at my command let their motto be be just and fear not it would take much too long to review here lord robert's work in and for the league of nations let_us recall just one or two facts the league had in 1920 set_up a permanent court of international justice in accordance_with article 14 of the covenant and the first panel of judges was named in 1921 cecil took an active_part in this work and when it was completed he reminded the league of the other article of promise in the covenant article 8 which requires that disarmament be carried_out by means of international agreements disarmament he said is the next great cause with which the league must concern itself and to this cause he devoted great effort he explored avenues which he thought might provide a short cut but which sometimes turned out to be blind alleys but at no time did he lose sight of the goal for ten_years after joining the new conservative government under stanley baldwin11 in 1923 he was the united kingdom delegate both in the council and in the assembly although with some interruptions as for instance during the first labor government in 1924 the year of the geneva_protocol 12 his official position now tied his hands and he no_longer possessed the freedom of action which he had enjoyed as representative of his friend and ally general smuts he was not always able to sit on the disarmament commissions it is no secret that he sometimes thought of leaving the conservative party but the bonds which tied him to the party of his forebears proved too strong he remained in its ranks representing the british empire for example on the preparatory disarmament commission charged with the study of the technical aspects of the disarmament problem many times during those years he watched with dismay the undermining of the league by the policy supported by certain governments including his own which was reducing the league to that respectable mediocrity which was as he had said in his first speech in the assembly what he feared most the weak policy of the great_powers toward japan in 1931 1932 was a step in this undermining policy and the last time cecil attended the assembly in september 1932 he delivered a memorable and dynamic speech on the question of disarmament describing it as a touchstone for the will to peace if disarmament were once carried through he said the international atmosphere would suddenly be transformed the nations would have cast their ultimate vote for peace if on the other_hand they rejected disarmament the world would sink back into the state of prewar days i_am inclined to believe that cecil intended this remarkable speech to mark his farewell to the policy of his party at home in the house of lords where he had sat since he had become viscount cecil of chelwood in 1923 he now took his place on the nonparty cross benches there he joined company with the bishops who of course hold themselves aloof from party allegiances he was again a free man archimedes has said give me a place to stand outside the earth and i will move the earth from the very first cecil has worked to obtain a platform outside the league in order to keep it moving that platform he has sought and found in public_opinion his initiative helped to establish the league of nations union13 in great_britain an influential organization which has some impressive achievements to its credit cecil remains its president to this day england's example has been followed in most other countries cecil has also been president of the international federation of the league of nations societies14 for two years the presidency of this organization changing in rotation the bitter disappointments of recent_years have in no way succeeded in cooling cecil's ardor he has been the main instigator of two big attempts to mobilize public_opinion in the fight_against war and international anarchy the first of these was national in character the so_called peace ballot of 1934 an unofficial referendum to sound public_opinion on the league of nations cecil had planned the program directed publicity and was himself an active participant the optimists had hoped to receive four to five million replies to the five questions put in actual fact no less_than eleven and a half million questionnaires were returned and it transpired that an overwhelming majority eleven million were in favor of the league of nations ten and a half million for disarmament ten_million for the use of economic sanctions against an aggressor 6,780,000 for military sanctions the most valuable result of this endeavor was that not only those_who had cast their votes but many others besides were led to consider the problem of peace and its solution through the medium of the league of nations at the same_time public_opinion had unmistakably expressed itself in favor of the league of nations so when the baldwin government proclaimed a general election at a time when the ethiopian crisis was becoming increasingly grave it was forced to declare itself firmly in favor of the collective system we know unfortunately that once the election was over and once the government had won its victory it retreated from the consequences it chose to abandon the sanctions and to embark instead upon the most gigantic rearmament program that our time has known it is common knowledge that this was a painful blow to lord cecil he was now seventy years old anyone in his position might have been tempted to give up and a private speech of his suggests that he had come close to losing his fighting spirit it is thus all the more admirable that he nevertheless decided to launch a new venture he had shown that he had the support of british public_opinion now he took on the difficult task of mobilizing international opinion together with the french politician pierre cot he planned the international peace campaign15 it was so to speak a quand même from the old man the movement has achieved considerable success the support which this new organization has obtained ranging from conservatives like cecil himself his friend lord lytton and other prominent conservatives all over the world through liberals radicals the cooperative movement and other nonpolitical groups to socialists and communists shows how alert public_opinion has actually become to the danger of another war it is the dictators menacing attack upon world peace in africa spain and the far east which has created the need for concentration unfortunately the membership of the campaign is not as comprehensive as one would have wished for no one living under the dictatorships can give it open support the international peace campaign does_not seek to compete with any of the existing organizations its object is to unite them in a common front to promote concentrated action its program is therefore very moderate it works for the maintenance of what some years_ago was thought to be a lasting basis for international cooperation and peace it demands for the strengthening of the collective system only two but two very important reforms which in any case already form an integral part of the program set out in the league of nations covenant international disarmament and establishment within the framework of the league of nations of effective machinery for remedying international conditions which might lead to war 16 it is admirable and yet at the same_time sad to note that lord cecil's last great effort is not only generally consistent with but practically follows word for word the thoughts expressed in his speech at the university of birmingham nearly twenty_years ago admirable because it underlines the unity and continuity in his lifelong work for peace sad because it shows that in the fearful winter which we are experiencing in our international life it is unhappily necessary to rebuild everything from the ground up the stone of sisyphus but to the winner of the nobel peace_prize this year lord cecil of chelwood i think we should address the lines of a danish poet about the hero sisyphus not the deed fulfilled but tireless

here to receive the award we have asked him to tell us about the work of the nansen_office for he can certainly give a much more vivid account of this work than could any member of the nobel_committee on the basis of written reports the main speech of the day will therefore be made by mr hansson but first of all i should like to say a few words whenever the nansen_office is mentioned one figure immediately springs to mind that of fridtjof_nansen it is only a few years since he died but his image grows larger with every passing year we meet him everywhere in science in art in deep and unbiased human thought in politics and in political life we meet him wherever new ideas and new claims are being tested it is not as an advocate of a party nor of a single nation that he appears to us it is as a representative of mankind itself he stands for the rights and the dignity of man and it is to the spirit of man that he appeals he was the champion of a cause new to politics the cause of brotherly_love and he performed wonders first for the prisoners of war and then for the political refugees when he died a great_deal had already been accomplished but much still remained to be done so his work had to be carried on it has been divided between two organizations a high_commission in london for german refugees1 and the office in geneva2 which now bears the name of fridtjof_nansen and which has this year been awarded the peace_prize it had been estimated that the work of these organizations would be completed within eight to ten_years it was decided at the very beginning therefore that they would end their activities on december 31 of this year this period then will soon have elapsed once_again a great_deal has been achieved with much still remaining to be done there is little doubt that the refugees in need of assistance at the time of nansen's death have been helped to a very great extent in the meantime however new disasters have occurred once more leaving crowds of refugees in their wake refugees who are at this very moment pouring out of their countries in perhaps even greater numbers than ever before the work entrusted to these two institutions must accordingly continue it cannot cease on december 31 of this year the institutions themselves will disappear but fortunately their work will go on it will do so through the amalgamation of the two institutions that have hitherto shared it into a single high_commission situated in london where all activity will be coordinated the work accomplished by the nansen_office throughout its years of operation is great and it is easy to see that it has been influenced by the traditions of fridtjof nansen's time it is marked by two characteristics that rarely go together but which in nansen were combined the highest idealism and an exceptional faculty for the practical the work has carried a message to thousands of refugees all over the world who have waited helpless and wretched or have roamed from country to country without respite but it has borne a message not only to them it has borne a message to those in politics that political action has a higher goal than that of sowing discord and harvesting hate it has borne a message to each of us that however secure we may be within our country's frontiers we must not forget that the world is much greater than our little corner of it and that mankind's children wherever they may be and whatever they believe are joined together by a common destiny and by an indissoluble and inflexible solidarity everything that happens affects us all we must share not only the reward but most assuredly the responsibility too but it is not only the nansen_office that we should remember on this its day of tribute it was created by the league of nations and supported by it and at this time when many appear to be losing faith in the league it is right and fitting to recall this fact what we really need is an international body vested with the power which would place it above the states a body that could maintain discipline that could prevent war and create peace but this we do not possess at least not yet still we do possess something something we can never give up now that it has been created a platform for those_who wish to be heard an international meeting place and above_all an effective medium for extensive humanitarian work and it may be that fate has forced us onto the right path perhaps it is precisely here that we should begin with a worldwide humanitarian work that will pave the way for the more stable organization of which we have dreamed and for which we have hoped mr hansson will speak about the work of the nansen_office but i wish to mention one aspect which he cannot include the tremendous personal contribution he himself has made to it all of us have admired not only the rare administrative ability that he has shown but also the tinselfish devotion he has brought to the work and the warm humanity that has distinguished his mission we are glad that he has been able to come here_today as a representative of the nansen_office so that we can deliver the insignia of the prize into his hands 1 the high_commission for refugees coming from germany was established in october 1933 by the league of nations and incorporated into the league in 1936 2 the nansen international office for refugees was created by a league resolution in september 1930 it replaced the league's high_commission for refugees established june 27 1921 under the direction of dr nansen who remained high_commissioner until his death six years have passed since we last awarded the peace_prize six years during which war has dominated the world these war years in which men have fought for life and freedom on a scale unprecedented in the annals of history have offered few opportunities to speak and work for peace in this respect they are in contrast to the years of the first world war when the ideology of peace not only survived but even exerted an appreciable influence on many belligerent and neutral countries nevertheless the nobel_committee has found some who have been able even during this last war to work for the cause of mankind and for the creation of the international organization whose task will be to bring to reality the dream of preventing war the nobel_committee has awarded the peace_prize for 1944 to the lnternational committee of the red_cross and that for 1945 to mr cordell_hull of the united_states the international committee of the red_cross was awarded the nobel peace_prize on a previous occasion in the year 1917 the prize was given then while the war was still raging this time it is given after the advent of peace but in both cases it was earned by work done during wartime philip_noel baker put it well when he proposed that the prize be awarded to the international committee of the red_cross because the committee by its action throughout this war has held aloft the fundamental conceptions of the solidarity of the human race and the identity of the vital interests of different nations and of the need for true understanding and reconciliation if peace is ever to be brought about in doing so it has contributed to the promotion of the concept of that fraternity among nations referred to in nobel's testament the international committee of the red_cross is international in its activities but it is national in its composition for all its members are swiss citizens it is not by mere coincidence that it has found its home in switzerland whose very atmosphere must give it vitality for this little democracy has learned by experience that it is not impossible to forge solidarity between peoples of different origin but as is so often the case when institutions are established this one too owes its origin to the initiative of a single man and today in awarding the peace_prize to the international committee of the red_cross we cannot but think back to henri_dunant who was given no peace by the horrors of solferino's battlefields until he had made others aware of them1 his idea can be expressed as follows we must try to mitigate the horrors of war to reduce as far as possible the number of its victims and to prevent as far as possible the suffering it causes this work must be organized in advance before war breaks out for no one knows where or when war will come and it must be organized on an international scale in this way we shall also invoke and develop the spirit of brotherly_love which will oppose war in the most telling manner it is on this idea that the work of the red_cross is founded since he wrote this many of his ideas have been realized after its modest beginning in 1863 under the auspices of the societe genevoise d'utilite publique geneva society for public welfare the organized work he mentions has been solidly established through the red_cross and the geneva_convention of 1864 has made it possible to carry on the work during war2 and so in some respects the work has been made international but here as in so many other fields it has been difficult to awaken the spirit of brotherly_love i shall not elaborate here on the development of the international committee of the red_cross on the more highly organized form it took through its statutes of 1921 and in subsequent years on its function as a link between the national red_cross societies or on many other aspects of it it is on its work during the wars that i would like to concentrate the first really great test to face the committee came during the first world war its task could be said to be twofold it had first to ensure that the provisions of the geneva_convention were observed and second to forward information concerning prisoners of war and so on and to give help where help was needed we have to admit from the outset that the first task was not an easy one and that the protests from geneva in most cases produced meager results the second task on the other_hand was carried_out successfully during the first world war and contributed in a large degree to lessening the suffering of prisoners of war during the second_world war its activity has for the most part been similar in nature but its scope has greatly increased and has gradually been extended to new fields the committee's principal mission during the last war was to serve as a comprehensive information center on prisoners of war this has been not only an arduous but also a very extensive undertaking with the war still fresh in our minds we can appreciate more_than ever before what it means to be able to obtain news of the fate of a father a brother or a friend and even more important what it means to have an organization that can transmit correspondence between prisoners of war and their relatives it was first and foremost the committee which undertook this work another service which was of much greater importance during this war than during the first was the distribution of parcels to prisoners of war both those from relatives and also the collective parcels which were paid for partly by the belligerent powers and partly by contributions collected in various other countries i should mention here that the committee arranged for the distribution of in all several_hundred thousand tons of goods its work in this field on_behalf of prisoners of war was truly immense but prisoners of war were not the only ones to receive aid nor were they the ones who needed it most in greater need were the other prisoners the civilian prisoners or the political prisoners as the germans liked to call them their treatment and fate are so well_known that i shall mention them only briefly they were without legal rights and there was no international agreement giving the international committee of the red_cross the right to intervene on their behalf it was moreover difficult to achieve anything in the face of the nazi regime in germany not until the winter of 1942 1943 did germany authorize the committee to send parcels to political prisoners and shipping could not be started until the fall of 1943 and then only after many difficulties eventually however it did reach proportions which made it possible to save many lives while this work was being successfully pursued the committee encountered such great difficulties in the other parts of its activities that the results fell short of its expectations i refer particularly of course to the pro raised against infringements of international_law relating to the treatment of prisoners of war during this war just as in the previous one such protests rarely had any effect in contrast the inspection of prisoner of war camps carried_out by the committee's delegations proved to be effective although no inspection was possible of camps in russia or japan or of russian prisoner of war camps in germany and the occupied countries because neither russia nor japan had ratified the prisoners of war convention of 1929 this shows that full benefit can never be derived from a convention unless it achieves universal acceptance needless to say the committee was unable to inspect the concentration_camps in germany or in the countries under its occupation since germany considered them an internal political matter another great service accomplished during the last war concerned the exchange of prisoners although such exchanges were admittedly initiated by the belligerents the value of the contribution of the international committee of the red_cross cannot be overstated mere listing of the activities of the international committee of the red_cross cannot give a true picture of its significance this lies fundamentally in the fact that human lives have been saved and in the feeling of solidarity engendered by help that has penetrated the iron walls erected by war on_behalf of the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament i have the honor to present the peace_prize for 1944 to the international committee of the red_cross for the great work it has performed during the war in behalf of humanity 1 jean henri_dunant 1828 1910 co_recipient of

avery joyce red_cross international and the strategy of peace london hodder stoughton 1959 pp 247 249 cordell_hull has devoted his entire life to the stabilization of international relations best known to the public are his untiring efforts in the field of commercial policy efforts inspired by his desire to counteract autarchic tendencies both in the u.s.a and abroad of these efforts which considerably influenced national policies during the period between the wars and especially at the end of the twenties he says there can be no real progress toward confidence or peace nor permanent trade recovery while retaliations and bitter trade controversies rage 1 confidence and peace between nations have constituted his goal in all spheres of his activity this is the driving spirit behind his fight_against isolationism at home his efforts to create a peace bloc of states on the american continents and his work for the united_nations organization cordell_hull was born in 1871 in the state of tennessee in the united_states of america he passed his law exams as a relatively young man practiced for some years as an attorney and later became a judge but at a very early stage in his career he embarked on a political career in the ranks of the democratic party it is as a politician that he is known and it is to politics that he has devoted all his endeavors from about the age of twenty not until 1907 however did he enter the house of representatives prior to that time it is not easy to discern any clues to his later political attitude in the international field but his work reveals evidence of the conscientious and meticulous manner in which he attacked problems a key to his general outlook is provided by some passages in his maiden speech in the house in this speech he championed compulsory arbitration between workers and employers supported efficient regulation by the federal government of railway and shipping rates and opposed the abuse of power by large corporations in certain fields the same basic outlook can also be detected in his speeches on tax reforms at that time the revenues of the federal government were derived from indirect taxation mostly from tariffs the united_states supreme court having declared in 1895 that the introduction of an income tax in 1894 was a breach of the federal constitution refusing to accept this judgment hull reopened the question of taxation and after the victory of the democrats in 1912 managed to secure the introduction of income tax what interests us however is not so much the tax reform itself as hull's argument in its favor he certainly saw it as a means of increasing federal income but his first concern was with the effects of this tax as against those of the tariffs he was convinced that protectionism created monopoly and enriched the few at the expense of the many and that such a system could not be reconciled with the free competition in which he believed we see him here as representative of all that is best in liberalism a liberalism with a strong social implication at that time however he had not yet given utterance to his international views they found expression initially during the first world war as hinton his biographer says up to this time hull's tariff theories had been based_on his belief that protection was a domestic evil 2 by the end of the war his view on economic policy could be expressed as follows high tariffs are barriers obstructing the development of trade and friendship between nations thereby becoming barriers also to lasting international peace in his great speech to congress on september 10 1918 he expressed his view in these words believing as i have that the best antidote against war is the removal of its causes rather_than its prevention after the causes once arise and finding that trade retaliation and discrimination in its more vicious forms have been productive of bitter economic wars which in many cases have developed into wars of force i introduced the resolution in the house of representatives during the early part of last year which would provide for the organization of an international trade agreement congress the objects of which should be to eliminate by mutual agreement all possible methods of retaliation and discrimination in international trade 3 as early as 1917 he put_forward the idea of an international agreement to govern the methods employed in commercial competition the task of reducing trade restrictions was taken up in the league of nations and a basis for the work of the following years established at the great world conference in 1927 at geneva4 the culmination of these efforts was the world economic conference in london in 1933 which hull himself attended this time as secretary of state all of us who took_part in this work during those years know how every proposal we made encountered resistance time and again from various countries whose attitudes were governed exclusively by the political situation at home the 1933 conference as we know failed to achieve anything it may be that it was a mistake to lay so much stress on the question of stabilization of currency from the very beginning it was this which led to roosevelt's famous telegram in which he rejected the plan for currency stabilization on the grounds that as he put it a nation's prosperity depends more upon a healthy internal economic structure than it does upon the price of its currency in relation to the price of currencies of other nations this attitude which prevailed in the united_states and was expressed by roosevelt in his telegram brought hull's work in this direction to a halt as has so often been the case in international politics people could see the difficulties in their own_country and had faith in their ability to solve them in isolation from the world hull himself in no way subscribed to this view in a speech given on july 27 1933 in london he said at this moment the world is still engaged in wild competition in economic armaments which constantly menace both peace and commerce and a little later in the speech he added indispensable and all important as domestic programs are they cannot by themselves restore business to the highest levels of permanent recovery 5 yet hull did not give up even_though the london conference was a setback for his ideas in 1934 he secured the passage of a bill6 empowering the president to lower tariffs by fifty percent and to reduce import restrictions for countries prepared to grant similar concessions to the united_states he was eventually able to conclude no fewer than twenty seven trade agreements on the basis of this bill this law which was subject to a time limitation was last renewed in 1945 and authorized the president to reduce tariffs by forty five percent this was of course after hull had retired but it represented nevertheless a victory for his policy all of this marks a radical change in the economic policy of the united_states it is an affirmation of england's policy during the free trade period taking as a model the cobden treaty of 1860 of which the most favored nation clause formed an integral part7 although the change is partly due to the acceptance of the united_states as a creditor nation it signifies something more profound for hull it is his immutable belief that it will clear the way for improved international relations and remove one of the causes of war it is so typical of the man if he does_not succeed with a frontal assault then he immediately reconnoiters the flanks he yields to defeat but he never accepts it as final for his belief in the cause is too firmly rooted and he is realist enough to recognize what is politically feasible at any given time choosing to accept that rather_than await something which may perhaps come one day i have dwelt at some length on hull's work in formulating economic policies since it reveals characteristic traits in his philosophy and method but in so doing i have anticipated the events of his life i had come to his work in the house of representatives he became a member of the senate in 1929 but it was with the election of roosevelt in 1932 that as secretary of state8 he first had the opportunity to devote himself entirely to his ideas now it is always very difficult to say to what extent ideas and policies derive from the secretary of state and in what measure from the president and this is even more difficult with a man like hull because as sumner welles says cordell_hull is the least selfseeking man i have ever known one of the striking sidelights on the years of his distinguished statesmanship has been his willingness to stay in the background and to let others take the credit and glory i know of several outstanding instances where mr hull carefully diverted attention away from his own authorship or able sponsorship of a good plan so that some temperamental foreign government official might acquire merit in the eyes of his constituents at home as father of the proposal mr hull was content that the good idea should take root and flourish 9 this is high praise indeed for any man but still more laudatory when said of a politician since it is seldom that politicians are eulogized in such terms it is impossible in this brief synopsis to review hull's work in the years following 1932 for this would entail an examination of the united_states foreign_policy during that period no foreign_minister can have held office in more difficult times as i have already_mentioned the year in which he took up his appointment heralded the defeat of economic cooperation and the accession of hitler to power in germany each year brought events that could have driven anyone to despair and that inexorably led toward another world war yet hull never gave up despite opposition both at home and abroad if he found one path to the implementation of his ideas blocked he would try another if he could not achieve his ideal immediately he would make the best of the situation and return to the attack when the time was ripe nothing illustrates his approach better than his pan_american policy and his attitude to the laws of neutrality the pan_american policy sponsored by roosevelt and hull was launched at the montevideo conference of 1933 at which all the american_republics were represented roosevelt's good neighbor policy was at once the starting_point and the goal of a policy which recognizing the impossibility of embracing the whole world aimed first and foremost at creating peace and good neighborliness among the nations of the american continents as hull said in a private conversation we ought to be able to work out a pattern of life which will inspire the whole world to follow our example when the present tumult dies down 10 at this conference a convention was successfully drafted defining the rights and obligations of each nation its most_important clause perhaps was that which stated that no nation has the right to intervene in the internal or external_affairs of any other this conference was followed by the one in buenos_aires in 1936 and by the lima conference of 1938 one of the achievements of the buenos_aires conference was the approval of an agreement for collective security and neutrality in the event of war when the lima conference took_place the outlook in europe had become more ominous and a firmer and more somber tone could be discerned in hull's speeches which focused on the threat emanating from the totalitarian states at lima hull did not attain the goal which he sought the conference certainly represented a victory for the ideals of peace but little progress was made beyond the point reached in the conferences at montevideo and buenos_aires the chief stumbling block was the stand taken by argentina who for several reasons was unable to commit herself to the same extent as the united_states but to this must be added a circumstance which affected all the pan_american conferences namely the relation of the countries involved to the league of nations the south american countries were members the united_states was not and this fact gave rise to difficulties which prevented the conferences from achieving the desired results in europe these pan_american conferences have often been looked upon as a form of expanded isolationism but they should not be so regarded they are large scale attempts to realize the ideas of peace by international cooperation wherever this appears to be practical and to create as cordell_hull says an example which will inspire the whole world the struggle on the law of neutrality and the fight_against isolationism are so recent as to be fresh in our memories the original law of neutrality can in one sense be said to serve the idea of peace and it cannot be denied that isolationism was pacifist in outlook but while the isolationists regarded peace primarily as peace for the united_states hull envisaged a more flexible form of neutrality which would permit the united_states to cooperate with other countries in maintaining peace because as he put it the united_states cannot unilaterally proclaim peace for herself alone in this as in other declarations he returns again and again to the theme that peace is not to be thought of as a privilege for any particular nation for him peace means peace among all nations but he is realist enough to know that it is necessary to struggle to achieve it as already_mentioned hull did not mince his words when discussing relations with the totalitarian states in europe and as the war drew nearer he made his speeches sharper and more intense everything within him his sense of justice his deep humanism revolted against what he considered an encroachment upon and a violation of everything that stood for decency but on the outbreak of war his voice was dominated by that of roosevelt who now spoke more strongly than before as the leader of united_states foreign_policy this had to be and it is hard for anyone not intimately involved to assess the credit due to cordell hull's work during these years one can only draw some conclusions from the little that is known he has devoted every effort to strengthening the forces marshaled against the aggressive powers but at the same_time has worked intensely on the problems which will arise with the coming of peace the direction these efforts were taking could be discerned in the draft of the six clauses governing the future policy of the four great powers11 adopted at the moscow conference of 1943 moreover as we now know he devoted strenuous efforts during the last stage of the war to the resolution of problems associated with the setting_up of the new organization the united_nations that is his latest contribution he says himself in the letter of resignation12 which he wrote to roosevelt on november 21 1944 after deciding to retire because of ill health it is a supreme tragedy to me personally that i_am unable to continue making my full contribution to such great international undertakings as the creation of the postwar peace organization the solution of the many other problems involved in the promotion of international cooperation and the final development of a full and complete structure of a world order under law to this letter roosevelt replied13 incidentally when the organization of the united_nations is set_up i shall continue to pray that you as the father of the united_nations may preside over its first session that has nothing to do with whether you are secretary of state or not at that time but should go to you as the one person in all the world who has done the most to make this great plan for peace an effective fact in so many different ways you have contributed to friendly relations among nations that even_though you may not remain in a position of executive administration you will continue to help the world with your moral guidance father of the united_nations roosevelt called him hull will assuredly not claim that the organization was his work for him it was of very little importance whether the credit went to him or to someone else provided the ideas triumphed for despite his great idealism he has always lived in the world of reality never doubting that it could be molded to fit the principles of justice principles of justice which in the united_states perhaps more_than anywhere else become the heritage of every individual from his schooldays on have been the guiding star of his work the locus where life and creed become one it is therefore with the greatest satisfaction that the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament presents the peace_prize for 1945 to this great american for his long and indefatigable work for

born in boston in 1867 she comes from an old new england family and grew_up in stimulating intellectual surroundings whose traditions can be traced back to the puritans who first colonized that part of the united_states these new englanders had freed themselves from the harshness of puritanism but they inherited the strict self discipline and energy and desire to make this world a better place to live in especially for the less fortunate members of society in this environment she acquired a certain idealism an awareness of her personal responsibility yet at the same_time she learned to recognize that work for a better world can be fruitful only if it is based_on the hard facts of reality as a young student she was first attracted to the study of literature but she was soon to take an interest in the work to which she was to devote all her energies in the period preceding the first world war the improvement of conditions of life through social reform the necessity of such work was first brought home to her when she became acquainted with the poverty and squalor of the slums in america's big cities she collaborated in the founding of a social center in boston and undertook other practical work as well becoming a member of the american federation of labor and helping to establish the women's trade_union league of america all this was in the early 1890 s at a time when europe was becoming increasingly conscious of the untold social problems bequeathed by the industrial revolution but the dawn of enlightenment had not yet broken over america practical work alone however did not exhaust the aspirations that gripped emily_balch she felt the need both to acquire knowledge and to pass it on to others if she was to achieve more and so she continued her studies first in paris under levasseur1 the historian of the french working_class and later in berlin where she studied that branch of economics which has been called a professor chair socialism 2 here she also came in contact_with the european labor movement and attended the socialist trade_union congress in 1896 in the same year she went to wellesley college first as lecturer and then as professor of social economics teaching was her principal occupation up to the first world war but her teaching went hand in hand with practical social work in the field membership on official commissions and authorship of publications a typical example is her work concerning immigrants she was the first professor in america to give students a course of lectures on problems relating to immigrants best known undoubtedly is her work on the slav immigrants in the united_states a work which is said to be a landmark in the scientific analysis of immigration problems3 this work provides a perfect illustration of her approach before putting pen to paper she visited most of the slav centers in the united_states and also did research for a year in those regions of austria hungary from which many of the immigrants came not content to rely on verbal or written sources she felt she had to see things for herself to meet these people and to study their conditions at first hand and then came the first world war putting an end to her university career for she was dismissed from her post in 1918 because of her pacifist activities but the war also brought a fresh challenge giving her life a new goal like so many others she saw the war as a futile interruption to the construction of a better world to use her own words my reaction was above_all a feeling that this was a tragic break in the work which to me appeared to be the real task of our time to construct a more satisfying economic order but the impact upon her must have been more powerful than she herself cared to admit for from the outbreak of the war she devoted all her strength to the work for peace or as professor simkhovitch of columbia4 says i have never met anyone who has as she has done for decade after decade given every minute of her life to the work for peace between nations emily_balch probably did not realize and few did at that time that 1914 was more_than 1939 the great turning point of our era it marked the end of an epoch and subsequent events have in many ways robbed people of their faith in the individual and in justice which have been the heritage and the source of strength for the best in this world men have grown harder since then more skeptical and the doctrine that might is right has found its way increasingly into both internal and external policies even after the end of this last war these then are the times in which emily_balch has waged her fight for peace they have not been easy but she has never relaxed her efforts whatever the obstacles in her path throughout the many years of her work for peace she has been closely associated with the women's international league for peace and freedom founded at the hague in 1915 while war was being waged the league provided a meeting place for women from neutral countries the central powers and the allied nations such a conference was still feasible at that time for the monstrous beast of war had not yet fully bared his fangs but the remarkable thing is that this was the only group of any importance within the belligerent countries to meet and reach agreement on a just and practical program for peace for it really was practical especially if we judge it against the background of its time i think the proposal is without any doubt the best which has so far been put_forward declared president wilson to the chairman of the women's_league jane_addams many of the resolutions were subsequently incorporated in the league of nations covenant although the program was drawn_up by the conference itself its realistic provisions owe much to the wealth of knowledge and practical foresight contributed by emily balch5 following the conference at the hague two delegations one of them headed by emily_balch visited neutral and belligerent countries alike to submit their resolutions to the statesmen a polite reception was accorded to them everywhere this is not surprising for the statesman is as a rule polite perhaps especially so when dealing with women but his true thoughts inevitably remain concealed behind his inscrutable smile the women failed to make any headway with their proposals and this was only to be expected with things as they were in 1916 emily_balch visited stockholm and took_part in the neutral conference for continuous mediation which was sponsored by henry ford6 at this conference she put_forward her proposal for international colonial administration a proposal which foreshadows the mandate system later adopted at versailles on returning home in 1916 she joined the ranks of those_who were fighting against america's entry_into the war she was a member of the collegiate anti militarism league7 and also sat on the council of the fellowship of reconciliation8 as already_mentioned her work for peace and her radical social views led to the loss of her professorial position in 1918 thereafter she joined the editorial staff of the nation a weekly which was in the forefront of the struggle for a just and permanent peace with the coming of peace the women's_league arranged its second conference at zurich in 1919 while the allies were discussing the peace treaty in paris the conference thus had the opportunity of studying a draft of the peace treaty time does_not permit_me to review the resolutions which were passed as a result of this study what i can and will say is that it would have been judicious to have heeded the women's counsel that few did so is sad though hardly astonishing in view of the political climate of the time besides the proposals had been put_forward by women and it is all too seldom that our male society lends a willing ear to the advice of women no matter how well founded it may be it would not be a bad thing if men would occasionally remove their bland smiles and listen after the zurich conference emily_balch stayed on in geneva as the secretary_general of the international women's_league a post which she relinquished in 1922 because of ill health in later years she spent a large part of her time in this center of international work a brief synopsis of her activity during these years cannot do justice to all that she did she took_part in most of the nine congresses of the women's_league which were held in the period between the wars her influence being felt particularly in the drafting of the resolutions she organized several of the conferences called by the women's_league to study particular questions such as modern methods of war opium the austrian problems and minority questions she took_part in conferences concerning stateless persons and the world economic crisis her influence extended not only to these but also to numerous other conferences not arranged by the women's_league she was in continuous contact_with the league of nations throughout her stay in geneva not only in connection with major political problems but also in relation to everything which could serve international cooperation with her practical outlook she understood that improvement in political relations_between nations could be achieved by encouraging them to collaborate regularly in specific fields typical of her work on such questions which form just one part of the great problem of peace are the efforts she made in 1921 in association with the american branch of the women's_league to induce the united_states to renounce its claim to priority for its austrian credits her efforts were to prove successful another and even more typical example is her work in 1926 to secure the withdrawal of u.s troops from haiti after eleven years of occupation9 once_again the initiative came from the women's_league and it was emily_balch who provided the driving_force behind everything that was achieved she never embarked on a campaign until she was sure of her facts she first traveled to haiti with a delegation whose report the greater part of which she herself wrote gives conclusive proof of her ability to get to the root of the problem and of her consummate skill in devising a practical and democratic solution that would greatly benefit the people these are aptitudes which must surely be the envy of many a politician then came the struggle to get the solution accepted in the end the american government carried_out practically all the delegation's recommendations and withdrew its troops now it would be a mistake to think that emily_balch has worked only through the medium of congresses and committees or through the pressure she could exert on state authorities one of the first to realize the need for education and instruction she initiated the international summer schools run by the women's_league during the inter war years she herself taught at these schools but this is by no means all in her extensive travels throughout the world she sought first hand knowledge of the conditions of life wherever she was meanwhile preaching the need for international understanding while in egypt she tried to make contact_with the women in palestine with the jewish british and arab leaders in england she gave a series of lectures in support of the ratification of the briand kellogg_pact to mention just a few examples in addition she delivered innumerable lectures in the united_states on the subject of internationalism and the league of nations in her fight_against the isolationism which kept her own_country at arm's length from the work of the league she fought america's passive attitude at a time when it was vital to be active but the years passed and the disappointments multiplied the first being the japanese occupation of manchuria10 after that one blow followed another a fresh world war loomed black upon the horizon yet men would not understand that when violence takes the helm and the rule of law is destroyed then is the time to stand on guard the events of those years evoked a sharp reaction in emily_balch she attacked isolationism and american neutrality legislation thereby placing herself for the first time in opposition to the american branch of the women's_league and with the coming of war we no_longer see her among the opponents of america's entry_into the conflict as had been the case during the first world war we can say perhaps that this was the time when she parted company from the absolute pacifists the quakers the fellowship of reconciliation and the war resisters league she had to ask herself the question which faced all those_who had worked for peace shall we submit meekly and allow ourselves to be devoured i only put the question let each man examine his own conscience and find the answer emily_balch found her answer for she believed that if we did not vanquish the evil we could not hope to achieve victory for the ideas which she herself had championed for so many years both before and during the war she worked enthusiastically for the refugees who came to the united_states especially for the jews but even at that time she was already looking ahead to the problems which would follow in the wake of the war hers was not just passive armchair interest for she personally drafted proposals for peace terms terms based not on unconditional surrender but on the realistic view that the world would have to be rebuilt she also drafted proposals for a constructive international settlement she has given her loyal support to the newly created united_nations organization and has brought all her influence to bear on american peace organizations to enlist their support for it even if it does_not now correspond perfectly with their ideals for she says the future shape of the new organization will not depend upon what the documents appear to state but on what the members make of it practice in cooperation is what will give the united_nations its character plans have not been set_up for a utopia but for europe russia america and all the other countries with their conflicting_interests and ideas and it is precisely because the proposals we have before us are fairly modest that they may perhaps be realized we see here yet another instance of her practical approach a lifetime of experience has taught her how great the difficulties are which lie_ahead but now and again we espy a different approach to the coldly calculating realistic evaluation of the task before us i cannot refrain from quoting a few words in her own language international unity is not in itself a solution unless this international unity has a moral quality accepts the discipline of moral standards and possesses the quality of humanity it will not be the unity we are interested in it is her basic conception that practical solutions no matter how refined technically count for nothing if they are not evolved from or if they do not rest upon an ethical foundation if the organization is autocratic in character or if it is not guided by the spirit of cooperation then it is worse than useless there are many who have shared this view in the past they are perhaps fewer in number today for such thoughts are not fashionable in this modern age a dream they cry but isn't life empty and worthless without its dreams even for practical everyday work the name of emily_balch may not be familiar to many of us here and there are probably few people in europe who still remember her now the war has erased so many names being a modest person she was never one to seek the limelight even at the height of her activity what was said of cordell_hull last year is i think also true of her she cares little whether the credit goes to her or to someone else as long as the object in view has been attained emily_balch has now reached old age but she remains active to the last and as she herself said when being congratulated on her seventy fifth birthday i think i shall live for quite a while yet for as my grandfather said an old woman is as tough as an old owl may her words prove to be no less_than the truth for the world cannot boast of many persons of her mettle even if we cannot say to her do you not smile on reaching the goal that goal which is the guiding light of those whose sights are set beyond the ending of each day we can still pay her homage and express our gratitude for her lifelong indefatigable work for the cause of peace she has taught_us that the reality we seek must be earned by hard and unrelenting toil in the world in which we live but she has taught_us more that exhaustion is unknown and defeat only gives fresh courage to the man whose soul is fired by the sacred flame 1 pierre

sino japanese war 1931 1945 john raleigh mott is an american like emily greene balch with whom he shares this_year's nobel peace_prize he was born in sullivan county in the state of new_york on may 25 1865 it was assumed that he would follow in the footsteps of his father a timber merchant engaged in transporting timber on the tributaries of the delaware river but he was an avid reader and the town's methodist minister persuaded his parents to allow him to continue his studies for a long time the boy did not know what he wanted to be his father hoped that he would return to the timber trade while he himself vacillated between the church law and politics but during his years of study he was stirred by the gospel of christ to mankind and when the y.m.c.a asked him to become a traveling secretary among the students of american and canadian universities he interpreted the offer as a call from the lord he answered the call it did not take him back to the delaware river it sent him out into the wide world and it has brought him here_today most of those_who have received the nobel peace_prize bear names which are well_known from peace conferences from congresses on disarmament problems and arbitration treaties or from their handling of acute political situations when they were able to play propitious roles in finding a solution to great and grievous conflicts but the venerable john mott is among us today because he has been faithful to the call which he answered as a young student and because he has created worldwide organizations which have united millions of young people in work for the christian ideals of peace and tolerance between nations he has never been a politician he has never taken an active_part in organized peace work but he has always been a living force a tireless fighter in the service of christ opening young minds to the light which he thinks can lead the world to peace and bring men together in understanding and goodwill his work has always been chiefly among youth for in them lies the key to the future they are the leaders of tomorrow the spirit that moves the hearts of the young will one day fashion the world and the old john mott is still to be found in the midst of the young a tireless servant of his master his long life has brought him profound disappointments but they have never broken his spirit nor cooled his ardor he believes that good will triumph in the end that all the trials and struggles all the disappointments and defeats must bring the fulfillment of the christian promise that all men shall become one we need only be faithful to our call resolute in our confidence that someday the spirit of unremitting service will see the seed sprout from the furrows of peace in a world free from fear the young university man who traveled from college to college to preach the word of god among the students felt a growing awareness of the tasks and possibilities which lay ahead he understood that the frank and open comradeship which bound together the christian students at the american and canadian universities could become a mighty impulse for the whole world if only the circle of fellowship could be widened from country to country and he was to see his dream become reality the world's student christian federation was founded in 1895 under his leadership at a meeting held in vadstena castle1 following this happy event mott departed on his first missionary journey he wanted to organize student associations all over the world on this journey he visited twenty four countries founded seventy new associations created national associations of christian students in india ceylon new zealand australia china and japan and selected corresponding members of the world federation in egypt hawaii and in many european countries since that trip he has gone round the world on numerous occasions someone has calculated that he has covered more_than two million miles on his travels that is equal to seventy times the circumference of the earth few men have traveled in so many countries spoken to so many people and inspired so much confidence as has john mott he never departed on one of his tours without adequate preparation when he was to visit a country he first studied its culture its customs its religious and political background when he arrived he was able to talk with those he met as a friend who knew the country the people and their way of life his mind was always receptive to new influences to other ways of thinking and feeling he was never an american bringing an evangelical message to poland to south america or to the east in an american style he was an apostle of a simple christianity presented in a form which made it living and real to the people to whom it was addressed god is our father he said but if god is our father then we are all brothers and no frontiers or racial divisions can separate us from each_other the students who flocked to mott's organization were not only protestants they came from the roman_catholic and orthodox churches from the thomist christians in india from the nestorian syrian and coptic churches mott's aim was to give the christian world new leaders whose love and tolerance would transcend the old frontiers which had previously separated people all races have a valuable contribution to bring to the great spiritual community he said and all races and nations are needed for christ to reveal himself in all his power and glory mott himself is a methodist but he never traveled as a representative of any denomination he worked among people of every creed and race and his help and advice were freely available to all he sought to make contact not only with religious circles but also with scientists political leaders statesmen and above_all with youth his simple preaching was a source of strength and inspiration to those whom he addressed or with whom he talked his powerful tinselfish and noble character won him friends and followers and opened the way for brotherhood between nations under the banner of christ always the central theme of his preaching to his other qualities must be added that of great organizing ability the world's student christian federation which he had founded at vadstena grew under his guidance into a mighty organization with hundreds of thousands of members in over forty countries he organized a series of world conferences of christian students the best known being the tokyo conference of 1907 which marked the movement's breakthrough in the far east the work of the organization its program and the resolutions which it sent out into the world bore the imprint of his forceful personality we christian students states one such resolution believe in the fundamental equality of all races and nations and we consider it a part of our christian duty to give expression to this principle in our relations with people we also believe it to be our absolute duty to use all our efforts to combat everything which can lead to war and to combat war itself as a means of resolving international disputes the work of mott and his student movement in the cause of peace goodwill and understanding between nations was a natural corollary of his view of christ as the prince of peace the movement's motto had at one time been make christ king and this summarizes mott's feelings christ was the king he served and the fight he waged was a fight to win the world for the peace which his king wanted to give to mankind for over thirty_years mott was the organizer and leader of christian students but at the same_time he has for decades been a prominent figure in the y.m.c.a the organization which first called him to the service of youth and in 1926 he became president of the world's alliance of young men's christian associations this organization is run along lines similar to those of the student federation but is much broader in character its membership drawn from every social class and occupation numbers two million boys and young men from more_than fifty countries it represents autonomous national organizations all over the world and of every christian denomination it arranges exchange of delegates and publications sets up study groups and international and ecumenical meetings and tries through planned activities to find constructive solutions to the problem of peace between nations john mott is still at the head of the world's alliance still its fountain of strength and inspiration his outstanding organizing ability and uncanny resourcefulness in the raising of funds for the member associations have materially assisted them in accomplishing extensive humanitarian work over and above their contribution in the spiritual domain when most international organizations were disintegrating during the first world war mott was gathering together the resources of his organizations in a mighty effort to span the abyss of hatred of those days by launching welfare work among the soldiers at the front and by bringing relief to millions of prisoners of war on both_sides he himself was always on the move traveling from country to country and visiting the fronts entering into negotiations with statesmen in belligerent as well as in neutral states recruiting suitable helpers for this vast project for which he collected no less_than 250 million dollars his men worked unceasingly to render captivity mentally and physically bearable for the prisoners of war trying to prepare them for a return to normal life after the war free of the bitterness that war and imprisonment engender so that collaboration between nations could once_again become possible it was one of the greatest works of peace ever carried_out in the entire history of war wrote president taft adding that it was chiefly due to mott's organizing genius and inspiring leadership after the armistice mott's attention and energy turned to the demobilized men and to such good effect that thousands of young men were saved from physical and moral ruin it is a powerful testimony to mott's outstanding organizing ability and zeal that he and his assistants were invited to conduct the work of rehabilitation in poland czechoslovakia greece bulgaria rumania estonia latvia and lithuania during world war ii the y.m.c.a with mott still at the helm resumed its gigantic operation to improve conditions in the prisoner of war camps with the coming of peace mott disdainful of his eighty years once more set_forth on his worldwide travels to reforge the international links which the war had broken and to arrange the first world conference of his organization this conference was held in geneva last summer under mott's chairmanship but it is not only international work among christian youth of all lands which has profited from mott's great_powers of leadership for a whole generation he has also been a leading figure in ecumenical work at the world missionary conference held in edinburgh in 1910 the protestant churches of europe north america and australia entrusted to mott the guidance of their international activities subsequently mott also brought the churches of africa asia and south america into this association he also founded and presided_over the international missionary council and the institute of social and religious research under mott's leadership at the world missionary congress at jerusalem in 1928 representatives of european and american churches met with representatives of christian churches from the muslim world the dutch and british indies from china turkestan persia iraq arabia and africa the conference adopted a detailed and constructive racial program embodying a code for the protection of the native against economic and social injustice as well as plans intended to prevent friction between nations pursuing a policy of economic expansion in 1938 he presided_over the third world congress of the international missionary council at tambaram in india mott has worked tirelessly in all parts of the world to combat racial prejudice he is perhaps better acquainted with this problem than anyone because he has been everywhere has talked with all manner of people and has systematically studied the conditions in all the countries he has visited wang who has four times been china's foreign minister2 says that in many crises in the far east when international complications could have led to serious conflicts mott exercised all his influence to bring_about a peaceful_solution in 1913 president wilson who had an unbounded confidence in mott's character and skill tried to persuade him to accept the post of ambassador to china because he was familiar with the people and the conditions in that country and because many of the men who were most active in setting_up the new government and establishing a new regime in china were his friends and helpers in the y.m.c.a movement but mott declined he had to remain true to his vocation he wanted to advance his work for peace through the many international organizations of which he was president i do not know when i have been so disappointed remarked wilson when he received mott's refusal when a serious conflict arose between the united_states and mexico in 1916 president wilson appointed mott a member of the delegation which he sent to mexico and it was quite in keeping with mott's reputation that the press should interpret his appointment as an outstretched_hand to mexico nor is it unlikely that his intimate familiarity with mexican conditions and his will for peace had a decisive influence on the successful outcome of the negotiations the following year mott was a member of the american diplomatic mission to russia his german friends later reproached him for having taken part in this mission but his assignment was in no way political and it is a remarkable tribute to the high regard in which he was held that the germans afterwards agreed to express their confidence in the integrity of mott's motives even_though they would have preferred his relinquishing his international position before taking the trip mott's work to subdue racial antagonism was a link in the chain of peace which he tried to forge around the world but it was more_than that it was also an endeavor to impart dignity to the relations_between human_beings within individual nations in his own_country the united_states he has performed great work on_behalf of the negroes to fight prejudices which exist in one's own society makes a bigger demand perhaps on a man's personality and strength of character than any other endeavor mott was the driving spirit in the movement to form associations in the southern states comprising both white and colored members the leading men of both races representing a variety of professions his aim was to bring_about a relaxation of the existing racial tension in 1914 he presided_over the first christian student conference for negroes ever held in the united_states during the same year and also for the first time in american history a congress was held under mott's chairmanship of both black and white christians from northern and southern states if we are christians said mott in his closing address we must be able to live side by side as true friends in equality justice and mutual respect this is the principle that has governed all of mott's work among the different churches and missions among races and nations the three great world organizations which have flourished under his leadership for a generation the student federation the young men's christian association and the international missionary council have in his hands been instruments for creating that spirit of christian tolerance and love which can give peace to the world elihu root himself a nobel peace_prize winner and at one time american secretary of state has said about mott his powerful personality and completely self_sacrificing devotion to the cause of peace have i believe never been equaled he does_not owe his influence to the official positions he holds rather it is the positions which have acquired importance through the work he has accomplished over the years he has traveled over the whole world using his official position to create and strengthen a universal sympathy for the fundamental ideas on which peace necessarily depends disraeli3 once said that it is a magnificent sight to see a nation saved by its youth but is it not even more magnificent says mott to see the student youth of all nations and races stand together in the struggle to maintain the high ideals of international peace and goodwill many eminent men and women idealists worthy of our admiration have done outstanding work in establishing peace and promoting general acceptance of arbitration_agreements between governments in organizing international courts and building up the league of nations or the united_nations mott has not done that but he has tried to create the climate in which the work for peace can grow in strength and security he himself once expressed it this way let_us always attach importance to arbitration_agreements and other international regulations to peace and arbitration conferences to publicity campaigns on these vital questions and to the display of sound practical judgment on these matters but let_us also be of one mind on the most fundamental issue of all that which will give life and effectiveness to all the rest that which alone can create and preserve the climate in which international arbitration can exist that which will make it effective or even better superfluous and that is to create the right atmosphere the right frame of heart and mind to instill the right spirit in the lives of nations mott's work has been devoted to the most fundamental issue of all he has gone out into the whole world and opened hearts to the idea of peace to understanding love and tolerance he has done it in answer to a call from god and guided by that call he has prepared the soil in which the hope of the world will grow 1 in sweden 2 wang chêng t'ing 1882 1961 foreign_minister for most of the period from 1922 to 1931 3 benjamin disraeli 1804 1881 british statesman and author the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament has awarded this_year's peace_prize to the quakers represented by their two great relief organizations the friends service council in london and the american friends service committee in philadelphia it is now three hundred years since george fox1 established the society of friends it was during the time of civil war in england a period full of the religious and political strife which led to the protectorate under cromwell2 today we would no_doubt call it a dictatorship what then happened was what so often happens when a political or religious movement is successful it lost sight of its original concern the right to freedom for having achieved power the movement then refuses to grant to others the things for which it has itself fought such was the case with the presbyterians and after them with the independents it was not the spirit of tolerance and humanity that emerged victorious george fox and many of his followers were to experience this during the ensuing years but they did not take up the fight by arming as men customarily do they went their way quietly because they were opposed to all forms of violence they believed that spiritual weapons would prevail in the long_run a belief born of inward experience they emphasized life itself rather_than its forms because forms theories and dogmas have never been of importance to them they have therefore from the very beginning been a community without fixed organization this has given them an inner strength and a freer view of mankind a greater tolerance toward others than is found in most organized religious communities the quaker movement originated in england but soon afterwards in 1656 the quakers found their way to america where they were not at first welcomed in spite of persecution however they stood fast and became firmly established during the last quarter of the century everyone has heard of the quaker william penn3 who founded philadelphia and the colony of pennsylvania around 1700 there were already fifty to sixty thousand quakers in america and about the same number in england since then the quakers have lived their own lives many of them having to suffer for their beliefs much has changed during these three hundred years outward customs such as the dress adopted by the early quakers have been discarded and the friends themselves now live in a society which is outwardly quite different from that of the seventeenth century but the people around them are the same and what has to be conquered within man himself is no less formidable the society of friends has never had many members scarcely more_than 200,000 in the entire world the majority living in the united_states and in england but it is not the number that matters what counts more is their inner strength and their deeds if we study the history of the quakers we cannot but admire the strength they have acquired through their faith and through their efforts to live up to that faith in their daily life they have always been opposed to violence in any form and many considered their refusal to take part in wars the most_important tenet of their religion but it is not quite so simple it is certainly true that the declaration of 1660 states we utterly deny all outward wars and strife and fightings with outward weapons for any end and under any pretence whatsoever and this is our testimony to the whole world but that goes much further than a refusal to take part in war it leads to this it is better to suffer injustice than to commit injustice it is from within man himself that victory must in the end be gained it may be said without doing injustice to anyone that the quakers have at times been more interested in themselves and in their inner life than in the community in which they lived there was as one of their own historians has said something passive about their work they preferred to be counted among the silent in the land but no one can fulfill his mission in this life by wanting to belong only to the silent ones and to live his own life isolated from others nor was this attitude true of the quakers they too went out among men not to convert them but to take an active_part with them in the life of the community and even more to offer their help to those_who needed it and to let their good_deeds speak for themselves in appealing for mutual understanding here i can only mention some scattered examples which illustrate such activity the quakers took_part in creating the first peace organization in 1810 and since then have participated in all active peace movements i would mention elizabeth fry 4 john woolman5 and other quakers active in the fight_against slavery and in the struggle for social_justice i would mention the liberal idealist john bright6 his forty year fight_against the principles of war and for the principles of peace his opposition to the crimean war7 and his struggle_against palmerston's8 policies many other examples could be mentioned to show how their active participation in community work in politics if you prefer increased during the nineteenth century yet it is not this side of their activities the active political side which places the quakers in a unique position it is through silent assistance from the nameless to the nameless that they have worked to promote the fraternity_between nations cited in the will of alfred_nobel their work began in the prisons we heard about them from our seamen who spent long years in prison during the napoleonic wars9 we met them once_again during the irish famine of 1846 1847 when english naval units bombarded the finnish coast during the crimean war10 the quakers hurried there to heal the wounds of war and we found them again in france after the ravages of the 1870 1871 war11 when the first world war_broke out the quakers were once more to learn what it was to suffer for their faith they refused to carry arms and many of them were thrown into prison where they were often treated worse than criminals but it is not this that we shall remember longest we who have closely observed the events of the first world war and of the inter war period will probably remember most vividly the accounts of the work they did to relieve the distress caused by the war as early as 1914 the english quakers started preparation for relief action they began their work in the marne district in france and whenever they could they went to the very places where the war had raged they worked in this way all through the war and when it ended were confronted by still greater tasks for then as now hunger and sickness followed in the wake of the war who does_not recall the years of famine in russia in 1920 1921 and nansen s appeal to mankind for help who does_not recall the misery among the children in vienna which lasted for years on end in the midst of the work everywhere were the quakers it was the friends service committee which at hoover's12 request took on the mighty task of obtaining food for sick and undernourished children in germany their relief corps worked in poland and serbia continued to work in france and later during the civil war in spain13 rendered aid on both_sides of the front through their work the quakers won the confidence of all for both governments and people knew that their only purpose was to help they did not thrust themselves upon people to win them to their faith they drew no distinction between friend and foe one expression of this confidence was the donation of considerable funds to the quakers by others the funds which the quakers could have raised among themselves would not have amounted to much since most of them are people of modest means during the period between the wars their social work also increased in scope although in one sense nothing new emerged the work assumed a form different from that of the wartime activity because of the nature of the problems themselves constructive work received more emphasis education and teaching played a greater part and there were now more opportunities of making personal contact_with people than there had been during a time when the one necessity seemed to be to supply food and clothing the success achieved among the coal miners in west virginia provides an impressive example of this work the quakers solved the housing problems provided new work for the unemployed created a new little community in the words of one of their members they succeeded in restoring self respect and confidence in life to men for whom existence had become devoid of hope this is but one example among many the second_world war did not strike the quakers personally in the same way as did that of 1914 both in england and in the u.s.a the conscription laws allowed the quakers to undertake relief work instead of performing military service so they were neither cast into prison nor persecuted because of their unwillingness to go to war in this war there were moreover quakers who did not refuse to take an active_part in the war although they were few compared with those_who chose to help the victims of war when war came the first task which confronted them was to help the refugees but the difficulties were great because the frontiers of many countries were soon closed the greater part of europe was rapidly occupied by the germans and the united_states remained neutral for only a short time most of the countries occupied by the germans were closed to the quakers in poland it is true they were given permission to help but only on condition that the germans themselves should choose who was to be helped a condition which the quakers could not accept nevertheless they worked where they could first undertaking welfare work in england and after that behind the front in many countries of europe and asia and even in america for when america joined the war the whole japanese american population numbering 112,000 in all of whom 80,000 were american citizens was evacuated from the west coast the quakers went to their assistance as well as opposed the prevailing anti japanese feeling from which these people suffered now with the war over the need for help is greater than ever this is true not only in europe but also and to the same degree in large areas of asia the problems are becoming more and more overwhelming the prisoners who were released from concentration_camps in 1945 all those_who had to be repatriated from forced labor or pow camps in enemy countries all the displaced_persons who have no country to which they can return all the homeless in their own countries all the orphans the hungry the starving the problem is not merely one of providing food and clothing it is one of bringing people back to life and work of restoring their self respect and their faith and confidence in the future once_again the quakers are active everywhere as soon as a country has been reopened they have been on the spot in europe and in asia among countrymen and friends as well as among former enemies in france and in germany in india and in japan it is not easy to assess the extent of their contribution it is not something that can be measured in terms of money alone but perhaps some indication of it may be given by the fact that the american committee's budget for last year was forty six_million norwegian kroner and this is only the sum which the american committee has had at its disposal quakers in all countries have also taken a personal and active_part in the work of other relief organizations they have for instance assisted in the work of unrra14 in a number of places such as vienna and greece today the quakers are engaged in work that will continue for many years to come but to examine in closer detail the individual relief schemes would not give us any deeper insight into its significance for it is not in the extent of their work or in its practical form that the quakers have given most to the people they have met it is in the spirit in which this work is performed we weren't sent out to make converts a young quaker says we've come out for a definite purpose to build_up in a spirit of love what has been destroyed in a spirit of hatred we're not missionaries we can't tell if even one person will be converted to quakerism things like that don't happen in a hurry when our work is finished it doesn't mean that our influence dies with it we have not come out to show the world how wonderful we are no the thing that seems most_important is the fact that while the world is waging a war in the name of christ we can bind up the wounds of war in the name of christ religion means very little until it is translated_into positive action 15 this is the message of good_deeds the message that men can find each_other in spite of war in spite of differences in race is it not here that we have the hope of laying foundations for peace among nations of building it up in man himself so that the settling of disputes by force becomes impossible all of us know that we have not yet traveled far along this road and yet when we witness today the great willingness to help those_who have suffered a generosity unknown before the war and often greatest among those_who have least can we not hope that there is something in the heart of man on which we can build that we can one day reach our goal if only it be possible to make contact_with people in all lands the quakers have shown us that it is possible to translate into action what lies deep in the hearts of many compassion for others and the desire to help them that rich expression of the sympathy between all men regardless of nationality or race which transformed into deeds must form the basis for lasting peace for this reason alone the quakers deserve to receive the nobel peace_prize today but they have given us something more they have shown us the strength to be derived from faith in the victory of the spirit over force and this brings to mind two verses from one of arnulf överland's16 poems which helped so many of us during the war i know of no better salute the unarmed only can draw on sources eternal the spirit alone gives victory 1 george fox 1624 1691 english

translation of this passage is taken from the friends quarterly april 1948 75 16 arnulf överland 1889 1968 lord boyd_orr occupies a unique place among the many men and women who have received the peace_prize over the years for while most others have been statesmen or politicians or international lawyers or persons associated with peace organizations john_boyd orr is not an international lawyer nor a politician nor a statesman nor can it even be said that he has been an active participant in peace organizations for long periods in his life his work has been devoted to the study of nutrition the diet of animals and men but however great his scientific contributions may have been they alone would not have earned him the peace_prize for scientific discoveries cannot in themselves create peace it is only when they are employed to promote cooperation between nations that they become a valuable factor in the cause of peace for john_boyd orr the purpose of his scientific work is to find ways of making men healthier and happier so as to secure peace he believes that healthy and happy men have no need to resort to arms in order to expand and acquire living space we must to quote his own words conquer hunger and want because hunger and want in the midst of plenty are a fatal flaw and a blot on our civilization they are one of the fundamental causes of war but it is no use trying to build the new world from the top down with political ideas of spheres of influence and so on we have to build it from the bottom upwards and provide first the primary necessities of life for the people who have never had them and build from the slums of this country upwards 1 elsewhere he says agreements between nations not to go to war have never lasted and will never be enough to maintain the peace the nations must construct peace through daily cooperation with a positive goal in view a goal which is seen to be mutually advantageous only this can remove the principal causes of war for boyd_orr roosevelt's words freedom from want 2 have become the very foundation of peace between nations john_boyd orr is first of all a realist as all of his work testifies born in 1880 he is descended from a scottish farming family and has strong roots in farming life and practical agriculture but apart from being a farmer he is a university professor and a scientist he began his medical studies at the university of glasgow later qualifying as a doctor his scientific turn of mind prompted him to take an early interest in research and the first problem to claim his attention was that of the nutrition of domestic animals in 1914 he was appointed director of the institute of animal nutrition in aberdeen his work however was interrupted by the first world war in which he served as a doctor after the war in 1919 he became director of the rowett research institute in aberdeen a position he held until 1945 when he became professor of agriculture at aberdeen university that same year he became director_general of the food and agriculture organization of the united_nations better known as the fao a post he relinquished last year during his term of office at the rowett institute boyd_orr laid the foundations for the agricultural and nutritional policies which he was later to pursue in the fao he published an impressive number of papers while he was director of the rowett institute confining his work until 1928 to studies on the nutrition of domestic animals his first work devoted to human nutrition milk consumption and the growth of school children which appeared in 1928 was based_on dietary experiments carried_out among schoolchildren in the mining districts this publication marked the beginning of a whole series of papers dealing with the subject of the human diet diet and illness diet health and agriculture and many others in 1936 he published food health and income a work which more_than any other helped to stimulate discussion of nutritional problems and to lay the foundation for a positive nutritional policy the originality of this investigation lay neither in its method nor in its general findings concerning the consumption of food in relation to different income groups earlier research carried_out in this field in several countries had revealed that a greater proportion of the income in lower income groups was spent on food and that the nature of the diet varied from one income group to another but this had become dead knowledge and was not used when it came to formulating nutritional policy what was original in boyd orr's research was the fact that by analyzing the composition of the diet he was able to indicate its nutritive value for each income group furthermore he calculated the nutritional level of the various income groups for the whole british population his results were so surprising they created a sensation they showed that even in great_britain where the standard of living was higher than in most countries the diet of a very large part of the population was inferior to that accepted by nutritional physiologists as adequate boyd_orr showed that a substantial increase in agricultural production was essential if the population was to receive reasonable nourishment an increase in agricultural production would be of considerable benefit for by providing improved nourishment for the population it would enable the population in its turn to raise productivity in general what had to be done therefore was to formulate and put into_practice a policy which would satisfy these two requisites it is no coincidence that boyd_orr thereafter devoted himself to the coordination of agricultural and nutritional policies not only in order to free mankind from want but also to create a basis for peaceful cooperation between classes nations and races originally it was no_doubt his deep compassion for those living in poverty as a doctor he had seen many of them in the slums of glasgow that induced him to study the problems of human nutrition he had been acquainted with agriculture since childhood and as early as the 1920 s he was keenly aware of the importance of having an efficient rational husbandry together with a food policy which would bring agricultural produce within reach of everyone's pocket he has always been opposed to any agricultural policy based_on restricted production continuing to develop his ideas he gave them concrete expression in a proposal he put_forward when he became secretary of the scottish committee of 1932 established by the national council for the development of scotland these were the ideas which later prevailed when it came to the framing of a food policy for great_britain boyd orr's ideas have left their mark on british agricultural and food policies had his work stopped there it would have been of little or no importance to international cooperation but his ideas soon spread beyond the boundaries of great_britain for agricultural and nutritional problems exist in every country today as always in the past yet the propagation of an idea does_not necessarily mean that it will determine the solution of problems the problems of nutrition were left untackled until the harsh reality of the period following the first world war impelled responsible men to seek an answer for the world was facing a situation in which famine was decimating entire populations while agricultural crises were arising from overabundance of agricultural produce which those_who needed it were unable to purchase and at the same_time the people in some of the agricultural countries could not afford to buy the products of their industrial counterparts because the farmers were too poor this was one of the problems highlighted at the world economic conference held at geneva in 1927 but no further progress was made at that time it was not until 1934 upon the initiative of australian high_commissioner stanley bruce that the league of nations assembly took up the question appointing an international committee of nutritional physiologists to establish the food requirements of the world boyd_orr was a member of this committee which presented its report3 in 1936 later in the same year a committee composed of nutritional physiologists agricultural experts and economists was asked to investigate the relationships among diet health agriculture and economics although boyd_orr was not a member of this latter committee he exerted considerable influence on its work the report4 was submitted in 1937 however the second_world war_broke out soon afterwards bringing these efforts of the league of nations to an end war gives little opportunity for international cooperation but it often happens in an individual country that things which would seem impossible in peacetime manage to get done in time of war and so it was on this occasion by means of rationing and other appropriate economic measures the british people were given as adequate a diet as can be provided in a time of scarcity this application of boyd orr's ideas resulted in a far higher level of health among the population than anyone had expected this was a step forward but more important still was the fact that even in time of war there were men whose eyes were turned toward the future men who could plan for the postwar era when the devastation of war could be repaired and the world led forward once_again along the path of peace boyd_orr was such a man in 1942 he visited the united_states as a private individual to canvass support for his ideas there can be no_doubt that the hot springs conference held in the spring of 1943 was strongly influenced by his views the conference endorsed the necessity of coordinating food and agricultural policies and proposed the creation of an international organization to study these questions the problems that would need an immediate solution after the end of the war were defined as was the policy which would have to be pursued if the whole world were eventually to be freed from want the resolutions of the conference were wholly in accordance_with the line taken by boyd_orr the organization proposed at hot springs the fao was launched at a conference in quebec in the autumn of 1945 boyd_orr who took_part in this conference was appointed director_general of the organization it was this post which gave him the opportunity to make his most valuable contribution in the international field boyd_orr regarded the establishment of this organization as one of the most_important steps that had ever been taken to construct a better world and to lay the foundation of a lasting peace in his own words all nations must accept the responsibility of assuring their own people the food which is necessary to maintain life and health governments must cooperate to ensure that this goal is attained by people in all countries this is the first step on the road to fulfilling the atlantic charter's promise of freedom from want one of the most_important tasks of the fao after the war was to ensure an equitable distribution among the nations of the world of the food products which were in short supply the international emergency food council set_up for this purpose was a kind of international rationing directorate whose operations continued until the summer of 1949 this rationing arrangement was undoubtedly responsible for preventing the famine which threatened many countries in the postwar period but such work does_not constitute the main responsibility of the fao its most_important function is to assist agricultural development and the production of nutritional raw materials in all countries of the world under boyd orr's direction the fao has become the most efficient organization in this field it has taken up a series of technical and economic problems which must be solved before any real progress in the development of agriculture can be made in numerous ways it has assisted the introduction of new farming methods this is in itself a vast undertaking for not only is it necessary to teach farmers modern methods it is also necessary to make their adoption economically feasible all this can be difficult enough in countries where agriculture has reached a comparatively advanced stage of development but anyone who is at all familiar with the methods practiced in the more primitive countries to the detriment of both the farmers themselves and of the world will readily appreciate the enormity of the task and it is precisely in those countries that action is most needed but boyd_orr did not stop at that for it was not enough merely to increase agricultural production it was essential also to arrest sharp fluctuations in prices and to prevent the accumulation of surpluses which remained unsold he had himself lived through the 1930_s governments must he says ensure the existence of a market with reasonable prices not just for the sake of the farmers but because it is to the benefit of commerce industry and the whole people accordingly he proposed the creation of a world food board which would assume wide responsibilities it was to stabilize food prices on the world markets to create reserves of food to meet shortages and to counteract increases in price in the event that harvests should fail to raise capital to finance the sale of surpluses to countries with the greatest need and finally to cooperate with organizations such as the world bank which could provide credit for the development of agriculture industry and the economy as a whole with a view to more rapid progress toward the appointed goal the world food board which was to be invested with strong executive power never became reality it was too big a step to be taken all at once in its stead the world food council an advisory body with no executive authority was established within the framework of fao in the summer of 1948 boyd_orr resigned his position as director_general of the fao but this is not to say that he has retired from active life he has continued to work for his ideas which have gradually become more and more comprehensive in scope in his early years he began the study of agricultural problems approaching the subject from the point of view of a farmer and of a nutritional physiologist even as a young man he investigated the relationships among men's diet their health and their life he saw the connection between agriculture which provides the means and human_beings who should use these means to improve their health and standard of living he fought for his ideas first in his own_country scotland and in england but he reached out beyond national_boundaries and embarked on international work under the auspices of the league of nations and so after the last war the opportunity came his way of devoting some years to laying the foundation of the organization which should turn his ideas into reality boyd_orr never loses sight of the principal objective he emphasizes more and more strongly how important international cooperation in economic matters is for peace and he attaches more and more weight to promoting rapid economic progress in the underdeveloped countries he says this will increase productivity and purchasing power and create wider markets for both agriculture and industry such a development is not only necessary to the welfare of countless human_beings but also to the continued existence of our scientific and technological civilization and to the establishment of a lasting peace he points out that science which has placed in our hands the means of achieving every possible technical advance has brought people closer together in a way which today renders geographical distances meaningless but at the same_time there continue to exist national economic systems still isolated from each_other as if nothing has happened indeed our twentieth century sees them more isolated than in the past if i have understood boyd_orr correctly it is what we might call the tension resulting from the disparity between the standards of living in different countries that is now the great danger a danger which could trigger a new war and what is the position today the greater part of the population of the world lives in countries which are economically underdeveloped the population of these countries is increasing more rapidly than ever before because medical science is now able to counteract the vast epidemics of former ages but a primitive economy cannot support a growing population which in many places now lives on the brink of famine in contrast to these countries we have those with a sound economy and a low birthrate in these countries the standard of living of the population as a whole has improved and continues to rise steadily this disparity creates tension between countries which is felt all the more these days now that progress in communication has brought nations closer together conditions in the wealthier countries have also become better known to the rest of the world since many citizens of underdeveloped countries have been pursuing their education in europe or in the united_states having once seen how people can live these citizens naturally determine that their own countries should reach a similar standard in a very short time unless we devote all our resources to help the economy of these backward countries the tension may one day build_up to the point of explosion boyd_orr has realized this perhaps more clearly than most men and it has been his life's work to find ways to reduce this tension being the realist that he is he has laid plans on the material and practical level let nations get together and discuss concrete practical questions which they understand are for the benefit of mankind then they can talk and reach agreement if they start by discussing frontiers and spheres of influence they will never succeed this thought is similar to that which jane_addams also a winner of the peace_prize expresses in her book peace and bread when she says a genuine society of nations may finally be evolved by millions of earth's humblest toilers whose lives are consumed in securing the daily needs of existence for themselves and their families boyd_orr has never forgotten how the average man thinks and feels he knows the farmer too well for that he knows that the man in the street hates war and all it stands for he hates it too and as the years have passed the idea of peace has gained an increasingly greater hold over him in 1945 he was elected_president of the national peace council which represents more_than fifty british peace organizations and this year he has accepted the post of president of the new world union of peace organizations he is also president of the world movement for world federal government his membership in these peace organizations is fully consistent with all his other activity he has always been opposed to those_who attach too much significance to national_frontiers those_who place their sovereign rights above_all else he never resorts to grand words when talking of peace what he says is plain and simple but his accomplishment is immense few can claim to have planned and carried through a work as important to the human race as his a work which clearly paves the way for peace for this great work in the service of mankind which once begun can never be halted he richly merits the nobel peace_prize 1 john_boyd orr welfare and peace london national peace council 1945 p 8

of the league of nations on the relation of nutrition to health agriculture and economic policy league of nations document no a 13 1937 ii a dr ralph_bunche was born forty six years_ago in detroit in the united_states so today he is still a young man and indeed along with mr carl_von ossietzky the youngest to be awarded the peace_prize consequently while most laureates have left their best years behind them dr bunche can still look forward to a long period of active life at the same_time he can also look_back on years of persevering toil devoted to the unremitting campaign to develop as he says man's ability to live in peace harmony and mutual understanding with his fellows the life story of dr bunche is like that of many another american youth born and brought up in difficult circumstances he had to go to work at an early_age becoming an errand boy at seven and at twelve working long hours in a bakery often until eleven or twelve o'clock at night it was at this time that both of his parents died and his old grandmother nana took him and the other children to los angeles here young ralph's life was divided between school and work for he had to work in order to live but again ralph_bunche was no exception for as he recalls seventy percent of the students at the university of california were obliged to do the same such a life can bee hard on the young but it can also serve to develop the strength of character necessary for making one's way in life and meeting the problems one faces in 1927 bunche passed his examinations at the university of califomia and in that same year started his studies at harvard where in 1934 he took his doctorate in political science from 1928 until 1938 he was an instructor and from 1938 until 1941 a professor at howard university in washington it was during these years that bunche began to study colonial and racial problems in 1936 he received a grant from the social science research council to examine colonial policy and the position of non european peoples in south_africa but before setting out for africa where he was to stay in cape town and later visit the african tribes he prepared himself for the work ahead by study in london bunche became one of gunnar myrdal s closest collaborators in his study of the american negro1 he soon caught the attention of the american administration which in 1941 gave him a post in the office of strategic services as an expert in colonial affairs later in 1944 he was appointed territorial specialist in colonial affairs under the state department and in 1945 became head of this division he was at this time as he himself points out the first negro to reach a position of such responsibility in the american administration on repeated occasions he was sent as an official representative to international conferences dumbarton oaks in 1944 the international labor conference in philadelphia in 1945 the constituent assembly of the united_nations in san francisco the same year he was also a member of the united_states delegation to the united_nations conference in london in 1945 and in 1946 as well as being among the representatives to the 1946 ilo conference in paris it was in 1946 also that he was appointed director of the trusteeship department of the united_nations secretariat these are the highlights of his remarkable career but they give little insight into the man himself for bunche as for most of us the early years before we acquire the knowledge and experience that life and work give were the formative ones looking back on his childhood bunche can remember no time when his family lived in conditions other than those of extreme poverty but it was not poverty which made him the man we know today for in the midst of this poverty was that highly gifted woman his grandmother nana he tells of his childhood when his grandmother and her four adult children with their families all lived under the same roof it was a closely knit matriarchal family in which the grandmother was the dominant personality a woman who had been born into slavery she must have been a truly extraordinary person and she unquestionably contributed more_than anyone_else to the molding of young ralph's character but life was no idyll says bunche i was learning what it meant to be a negro even in an enlightened northern city but he continues later i wasn't embittered by such experiences for nana had taught me to fight without rancor she taught all of us to stand up for our rights to suffer no indignity but to harbor no bitterness toward anyone as this would only warp our personalities deeply religious she instilled in us a sense of personal pride strong_enough to sustain all external shocks but she also taught_us understanding and tolerance 2 it was a valuable heritage that nana bequeathed to bunche one which was to help him enormously throughout his life he in turn has tried to pass it on to his own children he says in rearing my children i have passed on the philosophy that nana taught me as a youngster the right to be treated as an equal by all other men she said is man's birthright never permit anyone to treat you otherwise who indeed is a better american a better protector of the american heritage than he who demands the fullest measure of respect for those cardinal principles on which our society is reared nana told us that there would be many and great obstacles in our paths and that this was the way of life but only weaklings give up in the face of obstacles be honest and frank with yourself and the world at all times she said never compromise what you know to be the right never pick a fight but never run from one if your principles are at stake go out into the world with your head high and keep it high at all times 3 step out into the world with your head high fight for what is right but show understanding and tolerance for others what valuable advice for a young man to take with him when he leaves his childhood home these words were deeply engraved in the mind of ralph_bunche and fortified him for the challenges that lay ahead as i have already_mentioned bunche took up the study of racial and colonial problems early in his career in a book published in 1936 under the title a world view of race he exposed all the unscientific nonsense promulgated about races nonsense which has become a convenient and dangerous weapon in the hands of unscrupulous politicians and statesmen as we know from hitler's germany he also analyzed french and british colonial policies which however different they may be have not allowed the natives an opportunity to develop their potential he sees the racial problem as part and parcel of the much greater problem of the class war the war between those_who have and those_who have not this may rightly be called an oversimplification and in later books he broadens his view of man and society but we still find him returning time and time again to the opinion that the disparity between the standard of living in prosperous countries and that in underdeveloped countries is a source of unrest and a potential threat to peace in an essay he wrote in 1947 human relations in a modern world he outlines the problems of our time he contrasts man as a free individual with man as a member of a group in my opinion he writes there is nothing in man's nature which makes it impossible for him to live in peace with his fellowmen most of us i believe would be quite tractable if the pressures exerted by groups or by society would give us the chance but relations_between people are never governed by individuals for the individual is to a great extent a product of the group to which he belongs and is subordinated to the group in all important questions the individual in the mass is but a reflection of this group and so the relations_between groups and countries constitute one of the most critical problems of our time and he says we can achieve understanding and brotherhood between men only when the peoples of different nations feel that what unites them is a common goal which must be quickly attained bunche himself has a strong faith in man i_am firmly convinced that ordinary men everywhere are ready to accept the ideals inherent in understanding and brotherhood_among men if only they are given the chance but before this can happen men must be sure that they will not become victims of unstable economic conditions they must not be forced to take part in ruthless and harmful competition in order to survive and they must be free from the constant threat of being obliterated in a future war but it is more important still that men be able to shape their ideals free from the influence of petty and narrow minded men who still in many countries exploit these ideals to further their own ends but an indolent complacent and uninformed people can never feel secure or free one can say this is a faith a belief but who can do man's work in life without faith in bunche this faith is coupled with a profound knowledge of men and of their conditions of life both of which he clearly demonstrated as a mediator in palestine until 1948 bunche's activities had been confined to scientific and administrative work however when on may 20 1948 folke bernadotte4 was appointed by the united_nations as mediator in the palestine conflict bunche became his closest collaborator the two men worked together until bernadotte's assassination on september 17 of the same year bunche was then named as his successor by the un and continued the work of mediation in palestine until august of 1949 the two men who met in 1948 to undertake this common task could hardly have been more unlike on the one hand folke bernadotte grandson of king oscar ii of sweden and nephew of sweden's reigning monarch5 steeped in all the traditions of a royal family on the other bunche whose grandmother had been born in slavery who had been brought up in poverty who was an entirely self made man folke bernadotte was scantily informed on the palestine conflict my knowledge of the situation in palestine was very superficial he confessed he had not worked with international problems until the latter part of the war when he succeeded in negotiating the release of danish and norwegian prisoners from german prison and concentration_camps bunche head of the trusteeship department of the united_nations had back of him an education and training directed precisely at recognizing and understanding the problems raised by international disputes yet the two men had one thing in common they both believed in their mission bunche at one time speaks of the qualities mediators should possess they should be biased against war and for peace they should have a bias which would lead them to believe in the essential goodness of their fellowman and that no problem of human relations is insoluble they should be biased against suspicion intolerance hate religious and racial bigotry 6 both men were well endowed with such qualities and indeed they had to be richly endowed to have hope of accomplishing the difficult task which confronted them in palestine the palestine problem had occupied the united_nations for a long time it would take too much time to go into the background of the dispute whose origins date back to the end of the first world war in 1948 matters had reached the stage of a proposal put_forward in the united_nations for a solution embodying the creation of a jewish state but this suggestion met determined resistance and the whole of 1948 had been a year of constant skirmishes if not of open war when the british mandate over palestine came to an end on may 15 1948 there was actually open war already between the arab_states and the jews the truce commission which was sent to palestine in april was unable t o make any headway and it was in these circumstances that the united_nations on may 20 appointed bernadotte as a mediator whose first task was to secure a truce bernadotte and bunche arrived in palestine on may 28 and succeeded in obtaining a four week truce lasting from june 11 until july 9 this was a first step forward but on july 11 hostilities broke_out again and on the sixteenth the security_council ordered a cease_fire and an extension of the truce from july 18 this order came after bernadotte had personally laid the case before the security_council it is noteworthy that this was the first time that the security_council had given such an order then came bernadotte's assassination on september 17 and as already_mentioned the security_council appointed bunche to succeed him as mediator the initial cease_fire had been difficult to secure and there can be no_doubt that its swift arrangement was possible only through the personal efforts of bernadotte and bunche the latter comments7 this truce was a one man feat count bernadotte was a man of great urbanity and indefatigable energy he was a true internationalist at heart and was devoted to the cause of peace he was fearless in a remarkably short period he had won the respect and confidence of both arabs and jews the truce which began on july 18 was broken again in the middle of october it was then that bunche took the daring step of proposing to the security_council that it should order a cease_fire to allow both parties to try to reach agreement on an armistice as a preliminary to a final settlement of the relations_between palestine and the arab_states his proposal was approved by the security_council on the sixteenth of november the proposal was as i have said a daring one for an armistice is more_than a cease_fire an armistice in the accepted meaning of the word is in effect a preliminary to peace but it turned out that bunche had judged the situation correctly and so began the negotiations between the arab_states and palestine negotiations which dragged on for eleven months making the greatest demands on the mediator bunche has himself described the difficulties in the colgate lectures in human relations 1949 suspicion on both_sides with neither wanting to meet the other the arabs did not want to sit at the same table with the jews so he was compelled to negotiate separately with each side constantly having to clear away the mutual mistrust it must be borne in mind that this was not mediation between two parties but between palestine on the one hand and seven arab_states on the other and that agreements had to be concluded separately with each of the seven by exercising infinite patience bunche finally succeeded in persuading all parties to accept an armistice when asked how he managed it he gave the following reply like every negro in america i've been buffeted about a great_deal i've suffered many disillusioning experiences inevitably i've become allergic to prejudice on the other_hand from my earliest years i was taught the virtues of tolerance militancy in fighting for rights but not bitterness and as a social scientist i've always cultivated a coolness of temper an attitude of objectivity when dealing with human sensitivities and irrationalities which has always proved invaluable never more so than in the palestine negotiations success there was dependent upon maintaining complete objectivity throughout the endless weeks of negotiations i was bolstered by an unfailing sense of optimism somehow i knew we had to succeed i_am an incurable optimist as a matter offact 8 in these words he describes himself the childhood heritage the knowledge and experience acquired later in life both factors going to make up the personality the man who succeeded in getting both parties to lay down their arms the outcome was a victory for the ideas of the united_nations it is true but as is nearly always the case it was one individual's efforts that made victory possible it is just over a year since ralph_bunche completed his work of mediation today we are all confronted by even greater challenges than before the future looks dark but it is precisely in times like these that we must not lose heart on the contrary we must put our faith and all our strength in the fight_against war ralph_bunche you have said yourself that you are an incurable optimist you said that you were convinced that the mediation in palestine would be successful you have a long day's work ahead of you may you succeed in bringing victory to the ideals of peace the foundation upon which we must build the future of mankind 2 bunche what america means to me p 123 3 ibid_p 126 4

léon_jouhaux can look_back upon a long life of work and struggle to elevate the working classes and first of all to improve their conditions to fight through the trade_unions to raise the standard of living of the working_class is an important and noble thing to do but many others have devoted themselves to such work and that alone would not have brought him here_today to receive the nobel peace_prize he is here because from his earliest years he has time after time thrown himself into the fight for peace and against war doing so in the international federation of trade_unions in the international labor office the league of nations the united_nations and the european movement cooperation reaching across national_frontiers and the removal of social and economic inequalities both within nations and between nations have for him been the most_important means of combating war but he has had an even broader objective to mold a social environment capable of breeding what he calls the man of tomorrow the man who will be able to create a society in which war is no_longer possible léon_jouhaux was born in 18781 the son of a factory worker he went to work himself at the age of thirteen eventually becoming a worker in the match factory like his father and soon entering the french trade_union movement in 1909 he became secretary of the national organization c.g.t 2 with which he has been associated throughout his life remaining loyal to it in bad times as well as in good in his book le syndicalisme français which was published in 1913 and which naturally bears the stamp of that time he describes the organization of the french trade_union movement its aims and methods what is remarkable in a book dealing mainly with collective action is his emphatic conclusion that in the final analysis it is essential to awaken and to educate the individual to prepare himself for the great and arduous task of building the society of the future jouhaux has been in the forefront of the french trade_union movement in a difficult and troubled time war and economic depression have followed hard upon each_other and the trade_union movement has been split asunder reunified and split again faithful to his principles jouhaux has always done his utmost to prevent disunity but if a schism could not be avoided he has given his allegiance to the non communist section of the trade_unions he has always firmly believed that a trade_union should have room for everyone and that it should build on the solidarity of the working_class as such remaining outside political parties consequently he himself has never been an active politician except in the conflict with antidemocratic forces such as fascism in the period between the two wars and communism after the last war he served the popular front in france between the wars and in recent_years has taken part in the fight_against communism we cannot evaluate jouhaux's contribution without knowing something of his activity in the french trade_union movement it is true but today we are concerned primarily with his intensive work for international cooperation and peace even in his youth before the earliest signs of the first world war he was involved in trying to reduce national antagonisms and in fighting against war the most significant example of this activity was the plan for a meeting in berlin in 1911 between representatives of french german and british trade_unions to formulate a protest_against war the background of this meeting was the tense situation between france and germany resulting from their conflicting_interests in morocco france had occupied the capital of morocco and in july kaiser wilhelm3 had sent a warship to agadir to protect german interests in both countries this released a wave of nationalism that could easily have led to war the meeting in berlin did not achieve the importance expected at germany's suggestion only a few delegates from the c.g.t went to berlin ostensibly to study the german trade_union movement but this so_called study culminated in a large public demonstration against war later the same year another meeting was held in paris attended by representatives from germany spain and great_britain jouhaux speaks of both these meetings in his book le syndicalisme français in the chapter entitled contre le guerre this chapter is a fiery appeal to the workers to oppose war an appeal which lays great stress on the fact that private capitalism and competition in heavy industry between different countries constitute the main reason for war it is not at all surprising that jouhaux saw the situation in this light for at that time france was building up her colonial empire and germany's industry was expanding apace his attack was therefore directed as much against his own country's colonial policy as against germany and he fearlessly opposed the wave of nationalism which was sweeping through both countries and even_though we have now learned that the danger of war is not lessened by individual states having control over private capital his appeal will still stand as one of the major attempts made prior to world war i to mobilize the forces of labor against war it is also the first serious attempt to establish contact between french and german workers he emphasizes the importance of this for he says in this way a start could be made to erase the bitterness and hatred which had plagued relations_between the peoples of france and germany for the past forty_years we are thus creating between the french and german people the entente cordiale so desirable for the peace of the world there were many people at that time jouhaux among them who believed that through mass action the workers would be able to prevent war but no appeal including the last which was sent by the c.g.t in july of 1914 was to succeed as we all know war_broke out in 1914 and jouhaux took an active_part in it for this war was in defense of all that he himself had worked for throughout his life democracy and freedom he declared that a german victory would mean the destruction of democracy and freedom in europe yet all wars end and everyone who looks ahead must try to find the way to a lasting peace this jouhaux sought to do already in the autumn of 1914 the c.g.t traced the outlines of a peace program which was in essence the same as that proposed by the american federation of labor and its general theme was seen again in president wilson s fourteen points once the war was over jouhaux resumed his position in the c.g.t thereafter however he was to work in a larger area in 1919 he was appointed a member of the committee on labor questions at the paris peace conference and so had the opportunity of taking part in the founding of the international labor organization in the same year he was elected a member of its governing body a position which he still holds in 1919 he was also elected vice president of the international federation of trade_unions in amsterdam let_us first of all consider léon jouhaux's contribution as a member of the international labor office this organization is the only major international institution linked with the league of nations which has survived the war it is also the organization with the widest field of activity its objective is to remove one of the great obstacles to the realization of a lasting peace in the words of its constitution whereas the league of nations has for its object the establishment of universal peace and such a peace can be established only if it is based upon social_justice and whereas conditions of labor exist involving such injustice hardship and privation to large numbers of people as to produce unrest so great that the peace and harmony of the world are imperiled whereas also the failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labor is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own countries the high contracting parties moved by sentiments of justice and humanity as well as by the desire to secure the permanent peace of the world agree to the following then follow the articles which define the organization and function of the labor organization this new institution differed in one particularly significant respect from the league of nations only governments were represented in the latter whereas the ilo gathered under its roof the representatives of trade_unions and employers organizations as well as those of governments its operation is therefore based_on the collaboration of two parties apt to hold divergent views on many issues affecting labor these two parties come together to confer at an international forum and nothing is so conducive to understanding and goodwill as personal meeting and discussion of problems the work of the ilo during the thirty two years of its existence has been of very great importance in promoting social_justice and in creating equal working conditions in different countries the organization has been quick to lend an ear to new problems as they occurred and it has not been timid in tackling them the work which has been done is impressive and we can rightly claim that it is work in the service of peace throughout all these thirty two years léon_jouhaux has been on the governing body of the ilo and there is no other living member whose contribution can compare with his as a workers representative at the international labor office jouhaux was a member of the league of nations committee entrusted with the study of disarmament problems he has described this work in his very interesting book désarmemert which although published in 1927 is well worth reading even today in this book jouhaux expresses his faith in the league of nations as an international body capable of giving individual nations a sense of security for no nation will feel safe he says as long as its neighbor is militarily strong and under such circumstances it will not itself desire disarmament but if security is guaranteed by an international body then the road to disarmament is open these are the same ideas current today and if jouhaux was not the first to voice them he has championed them more energetically than most people he demands that the armament industry should not be privately owned and that if it is it must be brought under the control of the state he calls for the control of international trade in armaments and for effective control by the league of nations over disarmament i believe scarcely anyone today would deny that the manufacture of armaments ought not to be a source of economic profit or that the international arms trade should be subject to control but even if this can be brought about and it has been accomplished in a number of countries we now realize that state ownership of the armament industry and control of the sale of arms do not in themselves offer a guarantee of peace be that as it may we must judge his ideas in the context of the times in which they were conceived a period when the vast private empires that ruled the armament industry were at the peak of their power and when the trade in arms was unrestricted today these factors are no_longer the main obstacles to disarmament on the other_hand the proposal made by jouhaux for an effective organ to supervise disarmament is just as valid today as it was then and as such is well worth considering afresh as we all know the league of nations failed in its attempts to secure disarmament but the man whose goal is to build for the future does_not give up the struggle when he suffers a setback neither did jouhaux his work during these years was not confined to the labor office and the league of nations he took_part in every kind of work for peace he fought for the removal of those articles in the treaty of versailles which to him and to many others appeared to stand in the way of international cooperation and understanding he supported the policy of reconciliation pursued by briand and stresemann the period between the wars was a changing one from the buoyant optimism of the twenties it passed to the steadily growing pessimism of the thirties the economy of the world collapsed crisis followed crisis and high unemployment plagued every nation it is not strange then that a man like jouhaux should in times like these call again and again for steps to prevent the recurrence of crises which provide as he says a fertile soil for autarchy and consequently for war when hitler4 rose to power in germany the more farsighted saw the danger of war becoming greater and greater from one year to the next jouhaux was one of those_who interpreted the situation correctly and unlike so many of his colleagues strove hard for the strengthening of french defences after hitler's move in czechoslovakia in 1938 jouhaux tried to solidify the international democratic front in that same year he met roosevelt and asked him to intervene against germany but without success and then the war_broke out jouhaux once_again worked from the very first days of the war to bring the labor movement to exert its influence to make the eventual peace a true one he himself stayed in france during the war until the end of 1942 when he was arrested by the germans he remained in german captivity until the war ended during the years that followed jouhaux experienced many disappointments first when the non communist trade_union leaders in france left the c.g.t in 1947 to set_up their own organization and again when the new world federation of trade_unions was split in 1949 in both events he saw a breach in the solidarity of the working_class that solidarity outside political parties for which he had always toiled so earnestly he himself joined with the non communist trade unionists in his own_country jouhaux has since 1947 been president of the conseil économique an advisory body concerned with all important economic questions one which he had first proposed forty_years earlier and which was finally legally established under the new french constitution5 of 1946 on the international front he has continued his activity in the ilo he has been a french delegate at the united_nations assembly and he has taken part in the european movement of which he became president in 1949 this brief sketch of his life's work gives but the merest impression of jouhaux's contribution and of its influence on world affairs these cannot be measured by a list of his activities or of his individual achievements a lifework is given true substance and value only by the vital individual who puts his life into the struggle it is this kind of person that we find in léon_jouhaux his whole life reveals a man who has never faltered in the fight to attain the goal which he set himself in his youth to lay the foundations of a world which could belong to all men alike a world where peace would prevail he has realized that such a world can never become a reality unless its society is based_on social_justice and democracy he knew that the first step toward this ideal was to uplift the working_class and to improve its conditions but he has also understood that this is only a means of laying the foundation for a new world from all this emerges the man the warm impulsive and inspiring human being who has been able to draw others along with him but who has also shown that in order to reach our ultimate goal we must build on the world of reality in which we live he has devoted his life to the work of promoting brotherhood_among men and nations and to the fight_against war 1 most sources agree upon 1879 as the correct date 2 confédération générale du travail general confederation of labour known as the c.g.t one of the leading french labor organizations it included before wwi almost all of the organized workers in france although individually its worker members usually voted for socialists the c.g.t kept itself free of any actual party affiliations until the 1940 s when the communists gained control of the organization 3 william wilhelm ii 1859 1941 emperor of germany and king of prussia 1888 1918 4 adolf hitler 1889 1945 german chancellor and führer 1933 1945 5 the french constitution of 1946 was that of the fourth republic 1946 1958 albert_schweitzer was born in alsace in 1875 a few years after this province had become part of the german empire he has seen alsace reincorporated with france overrun by the germans during the second_world war and then once_again reunited with france having grown up in this border country schweitzer has from an early_age known three languages the dialect of alsace high german and french his upbringing has also given him a deep insight into both french and german cultures but albert_schweitzer will never belong to any one nation his whole life and all of his work are a message addressed to all men regardless of nationality or race this is not to say that schweitzer does_not like most of us bear the stamp of the home and the country of his childhood and youth the son of a pastor albert_schweitzer grew_up in the presbytery of the little village of günsbach in a happy and harmonious home he attended the village school along with the sons of the peasants these childhood years which he has himself described saw the development within the boy of those attributes which were later to characterize the man he speaks of little incidents which suddenly opened his eyes to traits which had previously lain dormant within him he tells_us for example of how an old jew who occasionally passed through the village became a target for ridicule from the boys and of how he responded to their goading with only a gentle smile that smile overpowered albert_schweitzer who subsequently took care to greet the old man with respect elsewhere he says that one day he threw one of his schoolmates at wrestling and that afterwards the boy said to him if i could eat broth every day the way you do i could be strong too those words made a deep impression on the young albert from that moment he not only lost his taste for broth but also began to insist upon dressing like the peasant boys a final instance a boy once persuaded him to go bird hunting but schweitzer scared off the birds before the other had a chance to shoot we all no_doubt have such experiences during childhood but we often forget them in later years or merely smile when we recall them in the wisdom of maturity but to albert_schweitzer they became something more the feelings evoked by these incidents far from fading persisted in him and became the very basis of his later life despite all the experience and knowledge which he subsequently acquired after finishing at the village school he continued his education in münster and later in mülhausen where he lived with his uncle and aunt he admits that he was not a particularly promising pupil i was probably too much of a dreamer he says only the teachers with whom he established a personal contact were able to record above average performance history and natural science were his favorite subjects it was during those formative years between childhood and adolescence that he opened his eyes to the world about him and began to ask why he says himself between the ages of fourteen and sixteen i had a compelling desire to discuss everything the joy of seeking the truth and the purpose of things became almost an obsession with me 1 some may say that it was the scientist in him that had awakened or was the urge to solve the enigma of existence perhaps already asserting itself subconsciously during this period he also found time to cultivate and develop the great talent for music which he had shown since childhood and to make a start on his masterly work on johann sebastian bach the qualities dimly discernible in albert_schweitzer as a boy stood out more clearly in early youth qualities which were to distinguish his entire life and work deep compassion for every living thing and the belief that people who live happy lives owe much to those less fortunate and thus have an obligation to help them as far back as i can remember he says the thought of all the misery in the world has been a source of pain to me 2 without doubt the young man's feeling of oneness with unhappy and destitute fellow beings as well as his compulsion to inquire into the meaning and purpose of existence was largely the result of innate qualities of his own but it is no less certain that the environment in which the boy was brought up helped to strengthen them his home his father's sermons the tolerance he found in the günsbach church where both catholic and protestant services were held under the same roof must all have influenced the sensitive religious mind of the young boy and the family traditions reaching back to the time of the enlightenment his maternal grandfather was a well_known rationalist pastor also left their mark this view seems to coincide with schweitzer's own for after telling us of his insatiable curiosity he concludes the spirit of the enlightenment inherited from my grandfather schillinger was rekindled in me 3 i have dwelt so long on albert schweitzer's youth because i believe that it explains all of his later life and work already at that time a flame burned within him a flame which he has kept alight throughout his entire life and which has become the inspirational source for all his activity here is what he himself has to say the conviction that we must throughout life struggle to continue to think and to feel as we did in our youth has accompanied me as a faithful adviser i have instinctively taken care not to become what most of us understand by the term a man of experience the knowledge of life which we adults should pass on to the younger generation is grow into your ideals so that life cannot rob you of them 4 his schooldays over albert_schweitzer entered upon his academic career with its years of study and hard work the curiosity which he had revealed so early in life had by this time swelled into an insatiable desire to seek an answer to all the questions that crowded in upon him and if we are to know albert_schweitzer we must understand the profound respect and reverence in which he held truth acquired through thought and reason he had shown this respect at an early_age and we have his own word for it that it has in no way faded over the years if i were to renounce any of the enthusiasm i feel for seeking truth i should be renouncing myself 5 his years of study were rich in work and achievement in addition to pursuing his theological and philosophical studies he began his work on the life of christ and on the gospels and started rough outlines for his works on philosophy culture and ethics at the same_time he was playing bach was engrossing himself in bach's works and was becoming the foremost authority of his time on the composer as well as the outstanding interpreter of his music in spite of all this activity he found time to take an interest in the construction of organs and it is largely thanks to him that so many old organs have been saved from so_called modernization6 but all this time preoccupied as he was by creative work he heard a voice within him which gave him no peace did he who had enjoyed such a happy childhood and youth have the right to accept all this happiness as a matter of course the natural right to happiness and all the suffering prevailing in the world merged into one in his mind and gave decisive direction to his future life and work it became steadily clearer to him that anyone who enjoys many of the good things of life should in his turn repay to others no less_than he has received and that we should all share the burden of life's suffering these thoughts did not always return with the same intensity but gathered slowly and inexorably at last they covered the whole sky as he puts it and led him at the age of twenty one to the decision to devote himself to the ministry to scholarship and to music until he was thirty and then after having realized his aspirations in the fields of art and learning to help his fellowmen in a more direct manner we gather from what albert_schweitzer has written about this period of his life that he had not yet formulated any precise plans but one day in 1904 when he was twenty nine years old he read an appeal from the french protestant missionary society in paris asking for help for the negroes in french equatorial africa this appeal provided him with a direct answer to his question how can i help best he wanted to contribute his share to the payment of the debt which the white man owed the black and he resolved to prepare himself for this task to do so he had to become a doctor we must try to grasp the full implications of this decision to be thirty_years old to be a well_known scholar in both theology and philosophy to have written a book on bach and to have become a world renowned interpreter of bach's music and then to cut all this short he himself explains why he wanted to go through the arduous toil of medical study first before setting to work i wanted to become a doctor in order to be able to work without words for years i had used the word my new occupation would be not to talk about the gospel of love but to put it into_practice 7 the study of medicine claimed seven years of schweitzer's life from 1905 to 1913 of it he says the pursuit of natural sciences gave me more_than just the knowledge i sought it was for me a spiritual experience i had always felt that the so_called humanities with which i had been concerned present a psychic danger because they rarely reveal self_evident truths but often present value judgments which masquerade as truth because of the way in which they are clothed now suddenly i stood in another world i was now working with truths based_on realities and i was among men who took it for granted that every statement had to be supported by fact 8 the study of medicine gave him great satisfaction indeed it was as if he had been initiated into an entirely new world nevertheless while pursuing his intensive medical studies and paying for them by lecturing and giving organ recitals he continued his work in philosophy and theology and during this period completed the german edition of his work on bach as well as his study on bach's preludes and fugues in 1913 schweitzer finished his studies and qualified as a doctor of medicine to obtain the money he needed to purchase equipment for his projected hospital in africa he pleaded with his friends and acquaintances to the point of begging meanwhile the protestant missionary society had expressed doubts as to his orthodoxy and it was only after schweitzer had given a formal promise to confine himself to his medical work and not try to influence the faith of the christian negroes that the society accepted him and so at long last on good_friday in the spring of 1913 albert_schweitzer set out upon his journey to lambaréné in west africa lambaréné is a small village on the banks of the river ogowé close to the equator some 125 miles from the coast it was here that schweitzer began his new life a life totally different from that of the academic world in which he had moved hitherto and one which demanded very different qualities there deep in the primeval forest he began his work among backward natives who had met the white man and who had become acquainted with what european civilization brings in its wake whenever it breaks new ground alcohol disease disintegration of the existing social systems in short all the evils which the white man first brings with him it soon became evident that schweitzer not only possessed great organizing ability but also was adept in practical skills such as the building of the houses or perhaps we should say huts which were needed for the treatment and care of the sick more important still schweitzer understood the mentality of these primitive people he did not appraise them with the eyes of a european and made no attempt to judge them according to our social customs and moral codes for instance he recognized polygamy as a natural consequence of their society and he believed that he would only make the bad worse by trying to abolish it nor did he adhere to the view that emphasized the educating of the negroes in order to produce officials and scholars he had no desire to destroy their existing social organizations and conventions unless he could replace them with something better he understood that help had to be given in such a way that it could take effect gradually and without any sudden disruption of existing social systems he realized that the task ahead would be a long and difficult one and that if he was to make any headway at all he would have to use simple methods which the natives could understand and so he helps them heals them and tries with untiring patience day after day year after year to release them gradually from the powerful and pernicious grasp of superstition all this in the hope that he will in the end perhaps succeed after innumerable and bitter disappointments in sowing a seed which may bring to life faith in the gospel of love if we choose to judge his achievement in terms of success in fighting sickness and disease then we should of course give pride of place to his work as a doctor but let_us never lose sight of the fact that the very impact of his personality and the propagation of his gospel of love will in the final instance achieve more and will in addition stimulate the growth of brotherhood_among races if we read schweitzer's own accounts of his life in africa the impression we get is not at all one of a sermonizing missionary but of a realistic man well acquainted with every aspect of life in the jungle and of one whose work is dictated by the need to help and to do so where the suffering is greatest albert schweitzer's initial stay in africa was however short lived when the first world war_broke out in 1914 he was placed under surveillance as a german citizen and in 1917 he and his wife were brought back to an internment camp in france the leisure he enjoyed there enabled him to continue with his religious philosophical and cultural studies which he had in any case never entirely laid aside even in africa where he devoted part of his nights to them when schweitzer was released from internment in 1918 he was ill and he stayed on in europe until 1924 since that date he has been living in africa leaving only to take an occasional trip to europe and during the years between 1939 and 1948 he never left at all indeed he is there now his visits to europe have always been marked by intense activity it seems that he has no need of rest he has given recitals both to offer pleasure to others and to obtain funds for the hospital at lambaréné which he has steadily enlarged he has given talks on religious and cultural topics all the while still searching for a simple definition of his philosophy some expression of it able to give others a meaning and direction to their lives we should never forget that schweitzer is a man with the deepest respect for thought and that it is through thought that he seeks to answer the questions he asks himself if we renounce thought we become spiritually bankrupt he says for anyone who loses faith in man's ability to discover truth through thought drifts into skepticism 9 schweitzer's faith in the power of reason and his craving for truth are unshaken and unaltered but he has come to the conclusion that systematic logical thought can take us to a certain point and no further he says the only progress that knowledge allows is in enabling us to describe more and more in detail the world we see and its evolution what matters in a world view is to grasp the meaning and purpose of everything and that we cannot do 10 he believes that he is the first western thinker who has dared to admit this shattering conclusion without at the same_time renouncing a philosophy and a world view that enshrine life but it was many years before he was enable to crystallize this philosophy into the simple formula reverence for life one day in 1915 he was forty_years old at the time while traveling on a river in africa he saw the rays of the sun shimmering on the water the tropical forest all around and a herd of hippopotamuses basking on the banks of the river at that moment there came to him as if by revelation the phrase which precisely expressed his thought reverence for life11 once_again as before in youth and childhood a simple incident opened the door for him but he says one cannot come to this by systematic logical reasoning and knowledge for neither can furnish an explanation of the world and of the purpose of life the explanation is found through what he calls elemental thought this leads to a reverence for that ineffable thing which is life to an affirmation of life which is more_than the will to live schweitzer puts it this way i_am life that wills to live in the midst of other life that wills to live 12 there is an affirmation of life in this which leads one beyond self to a reverence for all will to live so that everything which maintains nourishes and ennobles life is good and positive and all else is evil and negative on this thought schweitzer builds his universal ethic and through it he believes mankind comes into spiritual communion with the eternal he calls this philosophy of life ethical mysticism albert_schweitzer has been called an agnostic if an agnostic is understood to be a man who admits that we cannot find the answer to essential questions through rational thinking then the term can justifiably be applied to him but he takes his reasoning a step further and states that if rational thinking is carried far enough it leads to irrational mysticism i would prefer to put it like this where thought reaches its limits there faith begins and we are then close to religion schweitzer himself has expressed it in these words the world view based_on reverence for life is through the religious character of its ethic of active love and through its fervor essentially akin to that of christianity what christianity needs is to be filled with the spirit of jesus christ to become living intense a religion of love which it was meant to be since i myself am deeply devoted to christianity i seek to serve it with fidelity and truth i hope that the thought which has resulted in this simple ethical religious idea reverence for life may help to bring christianity and thought closer to each_other 13 this then is what albert_schweitzer has to say to us about reverence for life about the religion of love and about the concept of brotherhood great is the number of those_who have in the course of time talked to mankind about this a greater number in the past than in the present when the concept of brotherhood is being eclipsed by so many of today's slogans but even in these troubled and uncertain times men are searching for something which will allow them to believe that mankind will one day enjoy the reign of peace and goodwill if altruism reverence for life and the idea of

meeting to discuss the awarding of nobel's peace_prize for the first time and on the day when marshall who had not yet completed his twenty first year received a letter from the adjutant general of the army informing him that the examining board had found him eminently suitable for appointment to the regular army and that his commission would be issued to him after his twenty first birthday on that very day1 the first peace_prize was awarded in oslo it was given to henri_dunant who had founded the red_cross and to frédéric passy who had organized the first french peace society and was a pioneer in the work for international arbitration_agreements if anybody at that time had told lieutenant george marshall that fifty_years later he would not only be president of the american red_cross but also that he himself would some day receive the peace_prize the prediction would hardly have been believed and still less welcomed young george marshall may have seen himself as a future general but he had a long way to travel before he arrived at the clear and passionate understanding that the final object to be obtained by war the only justifiable goal is to make another war impossible it was a way that would take him over larger areas of the earth and the oceans and under the skies than any commander has traveled before him and let him see more battlefields and a greater devastation than any general has seen before him and let him plan and direct larger armies and fleets and air forces than history has ever known two things stand out for those trying to follow marshall's development on the one hand the insatiable desire to learn to know to understand and on the other_hand his keen and wide awake interest in the individual soldier his indefatigable work for the welfare of the soldier both things have had a far_reaching influence on his work and on the spiritual and social evolution of his mind his eagerness to find out everything about the human_beings for whom he felt responsible made him a sometimes rather terrifying phenomenon among his contemporaries twenty one years old he was made commanding officer of some of the small and utterly lonely outposts in the philippines he studied the language and customs and mentality of the natives he realized that the discipline he valued so highly depended first of all on his own self discipline and his capacity for keeping his men intelligently occupied for giving them tasks which could awaken their interest two words above_all others became his guide as he underlined it years later in an address to the graduating class at his old military school the words honor and self sacrifice the young officer demanded much from his men but still more from himself when he graduated from v.m i after four years there was not a single demerit beside his name and so it has continued throughout his life his record has always been perfectly clean and bright he was as straight and erect morally as he was physically wherever he was sent by his superiors he won the same reputation for eminent ability typical of the high esteem in which he was held is what happened in 1916 when he returned to the states from his second long stay in the philippines he took over the training program of a camp in utah and when the camp closed the commanding officer was required to make an efficiency report on the officers under his command one standard question is would you desire to have him under your immediate command in peace and in war the colonel2 wrote in reply concerning marshall yes but i would prefer to serve under his command in my judgment there are not five officers in the army so well qualified as he to command a division in the field the colonel then recommended that he be promoted to brigadier general notwithstanding regulations and then added to underscore his statement he is my junior by over 1,800 files with this reputation and such military recommendations marshall sailed for france in june 1917 with the first ship in the first convoy of american troops the incredible want of preparedness the confusion the chaos the lack of arms and munitions which resulted in 25,000 casualties in this first division of 27,000 were destined to be marshall's nightmare for many years to come it was made his task to organize both this division and others he became chief of operations of the division and later the aide to general pershing in the american official military records it is stated laconically he was assigned to general headquarters at chaumont and given the task of drafting the plans for the st mihiel offensive as that battle got under way he was given the task of transferring some 500,000 troops and 2,700 guns to the argonne front in preparation for that battle 3 he was made a temporary major lieutenant colonel and colonel he was recommended for promotion to brigadier general by general pershing whose right hand man he had become pershing's recommendation however was not accepted by higher authority and after the armistice marshall became captain once more for under american law promotion in times of peace can only be given under the strictest rules of seniority and marshall had to wait for fifteen years before he was made a colonel again it is not hard to understand why once made chief of staff he demanded that the rules of promotion be amended the amendment was passed in september 1940 and before the end of the year a certain major eisenhower was made colonel and then brigadier general jumping 366 senior colonels during the years between the wars marshall was stationed in tientsin for three years and just as in the philippines he had become an authority on the history and ethnography of the islands so in tientsin he studied chinese civilization history and language he was the only american officer who could examine chinese witnesses that appeared before him without the aid of interpreters and his few spare hours he utilized to learn to write chinese during the years of depression when he was colonel once_again the soldiers pay was reduced to such an extent that the married men suffered real hardship and their regimental commander started his first marshall aid he taught his troops to raise chickens and hogs he showed them how to start vegetable gardens he instituted a lunch pail system by which on the payment of fifteen cents each member of the family was fed the price was the same however many members there were in the family he and mrs marshall ate the same dinner so that it should not smack of condescending charity marshall had under his command an ever increasing number of c.c.c camps4 that curious attempt to combine some kind of military training with the effort to fight unemployment for the undernourished anemic helpless young men of these camps he had an absorbing interest he organized schools for them had them start news sheets amateur theatricals he had their teeth taken care of he stopped all drunkenness among them and when marshall in 1938 became assistant chief of staff and then deputy chief and in 1939 was appointed chief of staff he took with him to washington this active sympathy for the private soldier this strong feeling that the soldier has needs other than the merely physical the united_states at that time had an active army of approximately 174,000 enlisted men scattered over 130 posts camps and stations in marshall's first biennial report5 on the state of the armed_forces he remarks as an army we were ineffective our equipment modern at the conclusion of the world war was now in a large measure obsolescent in fact during the postwar period continuous paring of appropriations had reduced the army virtually to the status of that of a third rate power the united_states had no military strength that could prevent war or even an attack on america and marshall who saw the total war approaching and his own_country powerless clearly realized the truth of alfred_nobel's words good intentions alone can never secure peace it was during these years before america was attacked that the ground had to be laid for the later overwhelming war effort it was during these years that mrs marshall who was closest to him prayed every night o lord grant him time the task before marshall the burdens he had to shoulder during these years of war seemed beyond the power of man to bear that he did not break down was probably due to what senator russell6 expressed in the words most men are slaves of their ambition general marshall is the slave of his duties this deep rooted one might say fanatic sense of duty imposed upon him an iron self discipline which came close to having the character of a mystic faith he made it articulate in the most spontaneous and open speech he had ever made in june 1941 he gave an address at trinity college an episcopalian institution in hartford connecticut he himself belongs to the episcopalian faith and is an active churchgoer he said in his opening remarks i know that being with you here_today is good for my soul then he added if i were back in my office i would not be using the word soul he goes on to define what he means by discipline his doing so makes this address important for the understanding of the man and his work we are replacing force of habit of body with force of habit of mind we are basing the discipline of the individual on respect rather_than on fear it is morale that wins the victory it is not enough to fight it is the spirit which we bring to the fight that decides the issue the soldier's heart the soldier's spirit the soldier's soul are everything unless the soldier's soul sustains him he cannot be relied on and will fail himself and his commander and his country in the end it is morale that wins the victory the french never found an adequate dictionary definition for the word it is more_than a word more_than any one word or several words can measure morale is a state of mind it is steadfastness and courage and hope it is confidence and zeal and loyalty it is élan esprit de corps and determination it is staying power the spirit which endures to the end the will to win with it all things are possible without it everything else planning preparation production count for naught i have just said it is the spirit which endures to the end and so it is 7 this remarkable address is at the same_time a creed and a program it is the only speech in which marshall directly and openly expressed the ideas which occupied him most outside his daily work we are building that morale not on supreme confidence in our ability to conquer and subdue other peoples not in reliance on things of steel and the super excellence of guns and planes and bombsights we are building it on things infinitely more potent we are building it on belief for it is what men believe that makes them invincible we have sought for something more_than enthusiasm something finer and higher than optimism or self confidence something not merely of the intellect or the emotions but rather something in the spirit of the man something encompassed only by the soul this army of ours already possesses a morale based_on what we allude to as the noblest aspirations of mankind on the spiritual forces which rule the world and will continue to do so let_me call it the morale of omnipotence with your endorsement and support this omnipotent morale will be sustained as long as the things of the spirit are stronger than the things of earth 8 but after the trinity address marshall retired behind his protective armor and the passion always smoldering in his mind was not expressed in words until 1945 when he wrote his biennial report on the course of the war in this his words of sympathy for the common soldier have an almost explosive quality it is impossible for the nation to compensate for the services of a fighting man there is no pay scale that is high enough to buy the services of a single soldier during even a few minutes of the agony of combat the physical miseries of the campaign or of the extreme personal inconvenience of leaving his home to go out to the most unpleasant and dangerous spots on earth to serve his nation 9 nobel's peace_prize is not given to marshall for what he accomplished during the war nevertheless what he has done after the war for peace is a corollary to this achievement and it is this great work for the establishment of peace which the nobel_committee has wanted to honor but two documents give some idea of general marshall's importance to the democratic world during the years of war when the victory was won on may 8 1945 marshall was summoned to the office of the secretary of war the venerable republican henry stimson one time law partner of elihu root who was awarded the nobel peace_prize for 191210 mr stimson had invited fourteen generals and high officials to be present the seventy eight year old statesman then turned to marshall and said i want to acknowledge my great personal debt to you sir in common with the whole country no one who is thinking of himself can rise to true heights you have never thought of yourself i have never seen a task of such magnitude performed by man it is rare in late life to make new friends at my age it is a slow process but there is no one for whom i have such deep respect and i think greater affection i have seen a great many soldiers in my lifetime and you sir are the finest soldier i have ever known it is fortunate for this country that we have you in this position 11 and when marshall at his own request resigned as chief of staff in november 1945 he received from his british colleagues in the combined chiefs of staff a message which is surely without parallel it was signed by chief of the imperial general staff sir alan brooke now lord alanbrooke by admiral of the fleet lord cunningham of hyndhope and by marshal of the royal air force lord portal of hungerford12 it reads on your retirement after six years as chief of staff of the united_states army we your british colleagues in the combined chiefs of staff send you this message of farewell we regret that field marshal sir john dill and admiral of the fleet sir dudley pound two of your greatest friends and admirers are not alive today to add their names to ours as architect and builder of the finest and most powerful army in american history your name will be honoured among those of the greatest soldiers of your own or any other country throughout your association with us in the higher direction of the armed_forces of america and britain your unfailing wisdom high principles and breadth of view have commanded the deep respect and admiration of us all always you have honoured us by your frankness charmed us by your courtesy and inspired us by your singleness of purpose and your selfless devotion to our common cause above_all would we record our thankfulness to you for the leading part which you have always taken in forging and strengthening the bond of mutual trust and cooperation between the armed_forces of our two countries which has contributed so much to final victory and will we believe endure to the benefit of civilization in the years to come in bidding farewell to you who have earned our personal affection no less_than our professional respect we would address to you a tribute written more_than 200 years_ago friend to truth of soul sincere in action raithful and in honour clear who broke no promise served no private end who gained no title and who lost no friend 13 between mr stimson's words of national gratitude and the message from the british chiefs of staff we have general marshall's third biennial report which contains both his military testament and an introduction to what later came to be called the marshall aid it is particularly the last section of the report which is of importance here marshall called it for the common defense he opened with the statement that to fulfill its responsibility for protection of the nation against foreign enemies the army must project its planning beyond the immediate future for years men have been concerned with individual security but effective insurance against the disasters which have slaughtered millions of people and levelled their homes is long overdue 14 he then points to washington's plans for a national military policy and goes on we must start i think with a correction of the tragic misunderstanding that a security policy is a war policy war has been defined by a people who have thought a lot about it the germans they have started most of the recent ones the german soldier philosopher clausewitz described war as a special violent form of political action frederick of prussia who left germany the belligerent legacy which has now destroyed her viewed war as a device to enforce his will whether he was right or wrong he held that with an invincible offensive military force he could win any political argument it is the doctrine hitler carried to the verge of complete success this is the doctrine of japan it is a criminal doctrine and like other forms of crime it has cropped up again and again since man began to live with his neighbors in communities and nations there has long been an effort to outlaw war for exactly the same reason that man has outlawed murder but the law prohibiting murder does_not of itself prevent murder it must be enforced the enforcing power however must be maintained on a strictly democratic basis there must not be a large standing army subject to the behest of a group of schemers the citizen soldier is the guarantee against such a misuse of power 15 he concludes by emphasizing if this nation is to remain great it must bear in mind now and in the future that war is not the choice of those_who wish passionately for peace it is the choice of those_who are willing to resort to violence for political advantage 16 marshall had hardly had a week's rest after his resignation as chief of staff when president truman sent him to china as a special ambassador to try to stop the pending civil war between the communists and the kuomintang i.e chiang kai shek he did not succeed for when marshall was gone neither of the two parties honored the agreements they had undertaken but what marshall had seen and experienced in china strengthened the conviction which the devastations of the war had planted in his mind and which now received initial amplification in his report from china to president truman it was his marshall's opinion that steps had to be taken to assist china and its people in the increasingly serious economic situation and to facilitate the efforts being made toward peace and unity in china general marshall felt that chinese political and military unity could only be consolidated and made lasting through the rehabilitation of the country and the permanent general improvement of economic conditions 17 it is an opinion which marshall in another connection has formulated more generally in these words the historians have failed in their task they should have been able to discover and reveal the causes of war and make war impossible and when in 1947 marshall at the insistent request of president truman accepted an appointment as secretary of state it was because he believed that he saw the causes of war and chaos and because he intended to remove those causes insofar as humanly possible and in this way make war impossible his apprehension his fear of war his feeling that another war would mean the complete collapse of human civilization is closely akin to the apprehension in nobel's mind when he was drafting his will in 1893 he wrote in a letter18 i should like to dispose of a part of my fortune by founding a prize to be given every five_years say six times for if we have not succeeded in reforming our present system within thirty_years we shall inevitably revert to barbarism this prize would be awarded to the man or woman who had achieved most in furthering the idea of a general peace in europe and he also wrote une nouvelle tyrannie celle des bas fonds s'agite dans les ténèbres et on croit entendre son grondement lointain 19 marshall wanted to prevent what nobel feared less_than four months after entering the state department he presented his plan for that tremendous aid to europe which has become inseparably connected with his name he stated in his famous speech at harvard university our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger poverty desperation and chaos its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist such assistance i_am convinced must not be on a piecemeal basis as various crises develop any assistance that this government may render in the future should provide a cure rather_than a mere palliative 20 marshall carried_out his plan fighting for it for two years in public and in congress and when the marshall plan had become a living reality with the agencies for its operation established marshall stepped back but again he was called to service being made secretary of defense in september 1950 when he assumed this responsibility it was only to be in a position to put into effect his idea of building the future defense of the united_states on a democratic conscription and not on a standing army when this had been accomplished he retired once more this time to realize at last the dream of his life to grow a vegetable garden on his small estate in virginia the years that have gone by since he submitted his program have demonstrated its constructive character and the organs which have grown from the marshall aid have more_than anything else in these difficult years contributed to what nobel termed the idea of a general peace in europe and to a realistic materialization of the idea nobel in his testament called brotherhood_among nations although within a more narrow framework than marshall had desired the nobel peace_prize

awarded the peace_prize for 1954 to the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees war has existed in all times war between tribes war between races war between nations civil wars and religious wars war has always laid waste human dwellings forcing men to flee to escape its horrors and to find a refuge where they might live in peace but it is only during our own century that international work to help refugees has begun to take shape the first high_commission for refugees was established after world war i by the league of nations as a result of the initiative of fridtjof_nansen no single man has contributed more to this cause than has nansen and the work he started has never paused since i do not propose to review in detail the activity of the high_commission nor that of the international labor office nor yet the help that has been offered on all sides by private organizations and individuals the work begun at an international level in 1921 was continued throughout the second_world war for the refugee_problem created by the first war had still not been solved at the outbreak of the next during this last war tens of millions of people lost their homes either because they became refugees in their own_country or because they were forcibly deported to other countries or else because they fled of their own accord it has been estimated that there were between thirty and fifty million homeless at the end of the war we can never be completely sure of such figures but one thing at least is certain when the firing ceased there were millions of human_beings without shelter human_beings who had to be helped to find a place where they could live in safety already in 1943 the allies had set_up the united_nations relief and rehabilitation_administration the first task of this organization was to assist the countries which had been occupied to revive their economy but another problem awaiting unrra at the end of hostilities was the care of those_who had lost their homes as a result of the war and who were now in areas under allied control it was necessary to arrange for their repatriation unrra did splendid work its magnitude can be judged from the fact that its expenditure amounted to 3,900,000,000 the greater part of this sum was contributed by various governments ninety percent coming from the united_states and the united kingdom alone with the assistance of the military authorities unrra succeeded in repatriating six_million people by the autumn of 1945 but many more remained repatriation was not always easy to arrange this was partly because of inadequate transport facilities but also because of the frequently woeful conditions in the native country which made it impossible for the latter to take care of its own people but there were also many people who did not want to return to their own countries either because they no_longer had ties there or because they feared reprisals from the governments then in power these have become the real refugees men for whom a chance of a new life must be found outside their native lands after the united_nations had begun its activities the refugee work was taken over on july 1 1947 by the international refugee organization iro assumed responsibility both for the refugees who had previously been looked after by unrra and for those_who had been rendered homeless in the interwar period taking under its care a total of 1,700,000 people substantial progress was made through direct aid to refugees both inside and outside the camps thousands of people were rescued from hardship or even from death but perhaps the greatest service that iro rendered was that of helping about one million refugees to emigrate the cost however was immense during the few years of its existence iro spent 470,000,000 in 1949 it was decided to wind up iro and its place has now been taken by the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees the office began its work on january 1 1951 it is a nonpolitical body with social and humanitarian aims its main purpose being to provide legal and political protection for the refugees under the terms of its statute the mandate of the high_commissioner's office extends to all refugees with the exception of the arab refugees from palestine and of the korean refugees special organizations have been set_up to help these 1 the terms of reference of the high_commission are carefully defined in its statute will give the essential points the high_commissioner shall provide for the protection of refugees falling under the competence of his office by a promoting the conclusion and ratification of international conventions for the protection of refugees supervising their application and proposing amendments thereto b promoting through special agreements with governments the execution of any measures calculated to improve the situation of refugees and to reduce the number requiring protection c assisting governmental and private efforts to promote voluntary repatriation or assimilation within new national communities d promoting the admission of refugees not excluding those in the most destitute categories to the territories of states c endeavoring to obtain permission for refugees to transfer their assets and especially those necessary for their resettlement f obtaining from governments information concerning the number and conditions of refugees in their territories and the laws and regulations concerning them g keeping in close touch with governments and intergovernmental organizations concerned h establishing contacts in such a manner as he may think best with private organizations dealing with refugee questions i facilitating the coordination of the efforts of private organizations concerned with the welfare of refugees 2 the task undertaken by the high_commission was a truly difficult and formidable one the role it assumed may perhaps be described as that of protector of the refugees acting as a vigilant conscience to some governments forging cooperation among all others working for the cause of the refugees but unlike iro it could not play the role of the rich uncle freely dispensing gifts the high_commissioner for refugees cannot solicit voluntary contributions either from governments or from private charitable organizations without the authorization of the united_nations general_assembly the consent of the general_assembly is also required before the high_commission can initiate repatriation or emigration of refugees it has frequently been asked how the un could relinquish its financial responsibility for the refugees and place the burden on countries which because of their geographical location had given shelter to the greatest number of refugees and on the private and governmental organizations working for the refugees the answer probably lies in the huge expenditures made by iro for it was said that the united_nations had no mandate to dispense charity moreover the world was growing tired of the refugee_problem but then we have only to read the reports of debates held in the assembly concerning the refugees to be sharply reminded of the fact that the united_nations is a political organization where political considerations outweigh considerations concerning unfortunate human_beings one remembers the response fridtjof_nansen met when he begged the league of nations for help in the fight_against famine in russia3 the office of the high_commissioner receives the funds for its administrative expenses from the united_nations its personnel is strictly limited and even today after nearly five_years of existence the administrative staff numbers scarcely more_than a hundred the office headquarters are in geneva and it has branch offices in fourteen countries4 so that its representatives by being on the spot can keep in close touch with the refugees giving them any necessary protection and acting as intermediaries between them and the governments concerned it soon became apparent that little effective work could be done for the refugees unless the office itself had funds at its disposal in 1952 therefore the high_commissioner dr_van heuven_goedhart applied to the general_assembly for permission to raise three million dollars to provide the necessary funds the general_assembly granted its consent but it did so without enthusiasm even_though no burden on the budget of the united_nations was involved dr_van heuven goedhart's appeals to governments and private organizations raised the sum of 1,300,000 which has made it possible to relieve the most crying needs of the refugees the expenditure connected with european refugees in shanghai alone amounts to approximately 34,000 a month the original intention was that the high_commissioner's office should operate for only three years however it has now been decided that its activities should continue until january 1 19595 and the organization be authorized to raise 16,000,000 by voluntary contributions from governmental sources of this sum only 4,200,000 is assured as of now as i have mentioned the basic task of the high_commissioner is to provide help and protection to the refugees and so the office has sought by dint of untiring and sometimes thankless effort to bring assistance to the refugees and to help the authorities understand their problems this kind of work cannot be described in terms of figures but think of what it means to the individual refugee to feel and to know that he has not been forgotten that in spite of everything there is someone willing to help him even if the help cannot be brought immediately in addition the provision of legal protection gives him some sense of security and so helps to maintain his morale and to encourage him to begin a new life nonetheless such measures alone are not enough to solve the problem of the refugee what then is the solution the answer appears to be easy it is simply to give each refugee a social economic and legal foundation on which he can rebuild his life yet it is in reality as difficult as it appears to be easy the high_commissioner has himself indicated three principal ways to solve the problem the first is to enable those refugees who so wish to return to their own_country but very few of today's refugees wish to go back another way is to enable them to emigrate overseas as already_mentioned iro succeeded in helping a large number of refugees to resettle in other countries but it was easier then than it is now and iro also had the funds to finance such emigration there are yet other factors which now make it more difficult to solve the refugee_problem with the aid of emigration with the years that have passed many refugees are approaching or have reached old age and most countries who accept immigrants give precedence to those_who are able to work and who can thus become useful citizens for example it frequently happens that a male refugee is granted an immigrant's visa but that his family is rejected it may be that certain members of the family are unwanted in the new country because of their poor health or old age in such cases the man usually chooses to remain with them for his family generally means more to him than his own future but despite all the obstacles the high_commission has done much to stimulate emigration by appealing to other refugee organizations it has succeeded in promoting emigration to a considerable extent i might mention by way of example the emigration of 33,000 refugees in 1953 arranged through the intergovernmental committee in geneva6 a third possible way to solve the problem is to allow the refugees to remain permanently in the country of asylum and to give them citizenship status but once_again this has proved to be difficult to achieve it might appear that such a plan could be more easily implemented than before in view of the improvement in the economic situation and the resulting high level of employment enjoyed by some countries harboring large numbers of refugees nevertheless however willing a government may be in principle to grant foreigners work and residence permits it must first look after the economic interests of its own citizens we must look reality in the eye the inhabitants of a country are seldom very anxious to admit foreigners and government policy is all too often decided by lack of willingness on the part of the budgetary authorities the economic resources have not always been plentiful either and there are always many demands today which have higher priority nor should we forget that many refugees are living in countries which themselves have considerable unemployment the high_commissioner has encountered all these difficulties and many others besides but he has worked tirelessly to overcome them when dr_van heuven_goedhart has submitted plans only to have them rejected he has promptly submitted fresh ones he has often been forced to reduce his demands but he has never willingly given up until he has secured at least something and many are the measures which the high_commissioner has succeeded in pushing through one example of these is the project he submitted to the austrian government with the object of finding employment in agriculture for refugees in its final form this plan was not as comprehensive as dr.van heuven_goedhart would have wished but it was carried through and proved highly successful we must not forget that many of the refugees are capable people experience shows that they are hard working and better at economizing than other men after all starting with only their bare hands they strive to create a future for themselves and their families what they need is to be helped to help themselves and it has been observed that if given loans they are more conscientious about repaying them than many of those_who receive assistance in all countries but accept it as a gift without ever thinking of paying it back but we still have a long way to go before all refugees have been given such an opportunity some 300,000 refugees remain in europe 70,000 of them in camps there are about 13,000 refugees of european origin in china particularly in shanghai who have no hope of making a life for themselves there the refugees both inside and outside europe who come under the protection of the high_commissioner's office number some 2,200,000 in all ten_years have passed since the war ended and the refugee camps still remain here we find the old and infirm and those whose occupations are such that they find it difficult to obtain work in a foreign country the majority are professional men among them many intellectuals they are people who feel that they have nothing to look forward to and many have given up all hope of a better future but the camps also house children and young people who have never known any other home and none of them neither the old nor the young have a native country which could give them help or protection until the camps are cleared until the sick and old have been cared for until the young people and the children have been educated and trained for a profession or trade the refugee_problem is not solved earlier organizations have done much for the refugees living in the camps and the high_commissioner's office has carried on the good work it has also managed to persuade some countries to accept and to look after the old and the ailing those_who have been taken in by other countries include the blind and the old and even those struck down by tuberculosis the aim is to bring all these unfortunate people back to a normal life but it seems we will be a long time in reaching the goal i recently heard a description of life in a refugee camp to be sure the refugees get enough food to keep them alive but what else dreary hopelessness day after day bad accommodations worse than bad clothing and sanitation nothing to do but to sit there and wait and wait for what for something they no_longer have any hope of realizing of what use is it to take a few children on a summer holiday in some country only to send them back again to their camps this is the europe of today where one nation after another prides itself on having achieved the welfare state the office of the high_commissioner does_not have funds to change the situation and the funds of private organizations do not stretch far enough the high_commissioner has had the courage to state that deliverance can come only through common action and through financial support supplied by all in a united effort there may perhaps be some who do not believe that work for the refugees is work in the cause of peace although i have never actually heard this view expressed but it is work for peace if to heal the wounds of war is to work for peace if to promote brotherhood_among men is to work for peace for this work shows us that the unfortunate foreigner is one of us it teaches us to understand that sympathy with other human_beings even if they are separated from us by national_frontiers is the foundation upon which a lasting peace must be built today there are many who are active in the refugee cause and it is the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees which is the focus for the work it is an institution an organization that has statutes as do all other institutions but statutes are lifeless it is people who infuse life and it is dr_van heuven_goedhart and his colleagues who have shaped the high_commission and given it life for in their constant intense search for new solutions they have felt and shown sympathy and understanding for the refugees as human_beings the high_commissioner dr_van heuven_goedhart has never tired of proclaiming what he believes is right it is good to know that there are people who dare to make a stand against soulless and bureaucratic authority he and his colleagues represent the watchful conscience of our world for these reasons then the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament in testimony of its profound gratitude and admiration for you dr_van heuven_goedhart and for your colleagues has decided to award the nobel peace_prize to the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees 1 the un relief and works agency unrwa for palestine refugees in the near east began operations in may 1950 the un korean reconstruction agency unkra was established early in 1951 2 the translation of this passage is taken from un general_assembly resolution 428 v and annex december 14 1950 statute of the office of the un high_commissioner for refugees 3 nansen's pleas were refused 4 in his nobel lecture the laureate makes a reference to thirteen branch offices 5 the office is still in existence 6 presumably the intergovernmental committee for european migration the name adopted in november 1952 which started operations in february 1952 under the name of provisional intergovernmental committee for the movement of migrants from europe the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament has awarded alfred_nobel's peace_prize for 1957 to the canadian lester bowles pearson as we all know lester_pearson was canada's foreign_minister from 1948 to 1957 when as a result of the election the liberal government resigned the winner of the peace_prize for this year is then a politician and he is still a liberal member of the canadian parliament it can perhaps be said that what lester_pearson has done to prevent or to stop war would not have been possible had he not been an active politician that of course may be disputed what i want to emphasize is that the peace_prize has not been awarded to the politician or to the secretary of state as such but to the man lester_pearson because of his personal qualities the powerful initiative strength and perseverance he has displayed in attempting to prevent or limit war operations and to restore peace in situations where quick tactful and wise action has been necessary to prevent unrest from spreading and developing into a worldwide conflagration lester bowles pearson was born in toronto canada in 1897 his father and grandfather enjoyed high reputations as methodist preachers and the boy grew_up in a religious but broad minded environment in which even athletics played an important part in his training his father saw to it that he received a good education he enrolled as a history student at the university of toronto but his studies were interrupted during the first world war when at the age of eighteen he joined the university medical corps as a volunteer at the end of the war in which he eventually became an actual participant he resumed his studies and obtained his bachelor of arts degree in 1919 after an interval in his uncle's meat processing plant he won a scholarship for studies at oxford in 1923 he took his master of arts degree he taught for some time becoming an assistant professor of modern history at the university of toronto in 1928 when he was thirty one years old lester_pearson entered the service of the canadian department of external_affairs this step marked the end of his academic career and the beginning of his life as a civil servant he was first secretary at the department of external_affairs in ottawa until 1935 when he was appointed counselor at the office of the high_commissioner for canada in london he returned to ottawa in 1941 as assistant undersecretary of state at the department of external_affairs and in the following year he was appointed canadian minister in washington where he stayed until 1946 for the last two years as ambassador then followed two years as undersecretary of state at home until at the age of fifty one he became secretary of state for external_affairs in the canadian government in 1948 such is the brief prosaic data on mr pearson's career a career which indeed bears witness to great proficiency and intelligence but it reveals nothing concerning what he has accomplished how he has tackled the tasks with which he has been confronted or why he has solved problems in the manner he has naturally during the period when lester_pearson was a civil servant at the department of external_affairs he could express his views and opinions only to the canadian government it was however during those years which to him were largely an apprenticeship that he gathered his wide experience and broadened his outlook it was during that period that his views on international problems took shape he participated in the world disarmament conference1 in geneva in 1933 1934 in the london naval conference2 in 1935 and during that same year in the work of the canadian delegation to the sixteenth assembly of the league of nations these conferences cannot have been very encouraging to lester_pearson all of us who had to do with the league of nations in those years felt that we were going from one defeat to another for the young lester_pearson however just taking part in all this observing it at first hand has no_doubt proved a valuable experience and contributed infinitely to what he has later been able to accomplish the years in london from 1935 to 1941 at the canadian high_commissioner's office were very important and instructive for lester_pearson in close and permanent contact as he was with what was going on in europe at that time he has given an appraisal of conditions in the western european democracies after the middle of the 1930_s it is a violent criticism of their domestic policy as well as of their foreign_policy at home of their inability to master the economic problems abroad of their hesitation and indulgence their yielding to hitler again and again in the belief that peace could thus be preserved bringing them finally to the munich crisis of 1938 lester_pearson is said to have been one of the first canadians who recognized at an early stage that the way which had been chosen would not lead to the desired end war would have to come from 1942 to 1946 lester_pearson was in washington as i said as canadian minister and ambassador during that time he had more and more opportunity to bring himself to the world's attention he participated in the efforts to build the structure of peace efforts which started in 1943 long before the war was over his first remarkable contribution was made at the 1943 conference in hot springs3 which was concerned with finding out how the world's food and capital goods were to be distributed in peacetime lester pearson's effective part in this work was obvious gove hambidge gives the following description of him in his book the story of fao mike pearson young modest responsive intelligent and possessed of a quick sense of humor and a flair for working out effective compromises between opposing viewpoints had made an excellent impression at the hot springs conference he was elected chairman of the interim commission for food and agriculture which was appointed to prepare the plans for the permanent organization fao hambidge makes the following comment on his work on that commission more_than any other person he was responsible for steering the interim commission through two years of successful work at a meeting in quebec in 1945 when fao was established the work of the commission came to an end i would like to quote what lester_pearson himself said on that occasion because it shows so clearly that he was already aware at that early stage that international cooperation was threatened by the new progress of science in the field of nuclear research but his words also show that he holds a vision of a better world for mankind a world without fear and without want this is what he said we at this conference know and we have shown what science could do if harnessed to the chariot of construction man's fears have however harnessed it also to another chariot that of atomic obliteration on that chariot race with science driven by both contestants all our hopes and fears and agonies and ecstasies are concentrated if we lose in that contest anything that we have done here or may do elsewhere in london or washington or san francisco or moscow will have as much consequence as a pebble thrown into the gulf of st lawrence but if we should acquire some trace of sanity and bring social progress in line with scientific development by subjecting the annihilating forces of science to some sort of social control which in the last analysis means some sort of international control then the work we have done at quebec will have made a worthy and permanent contribution to man's long effort to move upward from the jungle of hatred suspicion and death where so many powerful selfish and frightening influences even today are working to keep him mired this was said in 1945 twelve years have passed since then and we have been witnessing just such a race menacing and fatal because if it continues there can be scarcely a doubt about the outcome the extermination or decay of a large part if not the whole of mankind the fact that this is a reality must have contributed greatly to mr pearson's views on the international conflicts of our time and must more_than anything else have influenced his convictions about the way in which such conflicts ought to be resolved at about the same_time the plans for fao were being made lester_pearson took_part in organizing unrra4 which was set_up mainly for the purpose of reestablishing the economy of the war ravaged countries after the war was over the organization was also to take care of the displaced_persons who had lost their homes as a result of war and persecution unrra was founded in 1943 and lester_pearson became the chairman of its supply committee in 1946 he was made chairman of the subcommittee for displaced_persons lester pearson's efforts in unrra bear the mark of the same personal qualities which he displayed during the organization of fao he undertook the work because he believed in a better world for mankind he carried it out by approaching the problems in a matter of fact way after a meeting of the council of unrra in 1944 he said so unrra must not merely do its job well it must do it so well that it will give heart and courage to the governments who slowly but steadily are building up the international structure of peace so well that it will by its example bring hope to men and women who if that structure falls will again be crushed beneath its ruins in 1946 lester_pearson returned to ottawa where he became secretary of state for external_affairs in 1948 he held that position for nine years during this period mr pearson has had a part in most of the important conferences which have been held for the solution of international problems his chief contribution to international politics however has been made within the framework of the united_nations organization as early as 1945 at the san francisco conference where the united_nations charter was formulated he had been an adviser to the canadian delegation he was the one who argued on_behalf of canada against the veto of the great_powers an argument he continued in the meetings of the general_assembly of the united_nations i would mention that he strongly supported the uniting for peace resolution of 1950 that resolution offers the following possibility when a war of aggression comes up for consideration and the security_council is prevented from operating by the veto of one of the great_powers the general_assembly can be convened at fortyeight hours notice in other words this resolution reduces the effect of the veto of a great power as far as he has been able to do so lester_pearson has endeavored to improve the efficiency of the united_nations to enable that organization to operate as quickly and effectively as possible during the time in which the united_nations has been in existence one international conflict after another has arisen and the moral strength of the organization has been put to a severe test the first really important conflict which the un had to deal with was the question of palestine this matter was considered in a special_session in 1947 mr pearson was elected chairman of the political committee and the special committee on palestine recommended that the british mandate over palestine should be discontinued and that the country should be divided into a jewish and an arab state the recommendation of the committee was considered at the second general_assembly the question of division was then dealt with by an ad hoc committee in which mr pearson participated very actively and indeed the recommendation had a positive result the palestine problem was actually put to rest for some time5 since then mr pearson has taken part in all the meetings of the general_assembly except in 1955 and he was its president in 1952 every time he has made significant contributions although i cannot here refer to all the different matters which have come up for consideration i would only call attention to his attitude during the fighting in korea when he was in favor of limiting hostilities as soon as the aggressors6 had been forced back he dissociated himself entirely from those_who wanted to proceed with the war until as it was said final victory had been won this is what pearson himself has said about the fighting in korea the action of free nations against aggression in korea has been limited and has had as its purpose not the destruction of the north korean and chinese peoples but the localizing of hostilities repelling the attack and then negotiating cease_fire arrangements as a prelude to peace these words reflect his realistic and positive attitude an attitude he has maintained consistently not just in the korean conflict if it is not possible to stop an aggression without using arms then call off the fighting as soon as the immediate aim has been achieved he advises do not go further but try to create a situation in which it is possible to work for the ultimate goal which is peace the next time the world was threatened by a conflagration of unforeseeable extent was in 1956 it all seems so close to us and we all remember the course of events at the end of july 1956 nasser suddenly proceeded to nationalize the suez canal the suez conflict was brought before the security_council in september and it seemed that it might be possible to find a solution then on october 29 israel marched into egyptian territory on the 30th the french british ultimatum was handed to egypt and the next day both these countries proceeded to the attack the security_council which immediately called on the aggressors to cease hostilities was made inoperative by the veto of great_britain and france the matter then came up before the general_assembly and on november 2 a resolution was put to the vote which required the aggressors to stop fighting immediately before this resolution was submitted lester_pearson had been working unceasingly night and day through conferences and informal talks to give the resolution a wider scope sufficiently comprehensive to form a real basis for a solution of the conflict and for creating peace with his rich experience his positive attitude and his determined vigor he pointed_out that the resolution lacked any provision for solving the problem itself he felt that this was a matter of decisive_importance in that critical phase of the developments when the world was at the very edge of disaster but lester_pearson did not give up his efforts even_though the resolution of november 2 did not contain what he had wanted in the acutely dangerous situation other ways out would have to be found on november 4 he submitted to the general_assembly a resolution in which the secretary_general was requested to put before the general_assembly within forty eight hours a plan for an international united_nations force to be employed in the area of fighting to secure and supervise the cessation of hostilities as we all know this was done never since the end of the last war has the world situation been darker than during the suez crisis and never has the united_nations had a more difficult case to deal with however what actually happened has shown that moral force can be a bulwark against aggression and that it is possible to make aggressive forces yield without resorting to power therefore it may well be said that the suez crisis was a victory for the united_nations and for the man who contributed more_than anyone_else to save the world at that time that man was lester_pearson during the hungarian revolution7 lester_pearson spoke at the emergency special_session of the general_assembly he strongly advocated that an independent international authority should enable all the hungarian people without fear of reprisal to establish a free and democratic government of their own choice why he asked should we not now establish a suitable united_nations mission for hungary when it has been agreed to form a united_nations authority in the middle_east during the hungarian revolution however the united_nations remained powerless mr pearson has frequently been mentioned as one of the most enthusiastic supporters of nato8 in this organization for defense of countries whose life pattern is based_on democracy and personal freedom he finds a guarantee for the maintenance of peace and human_rights in the world he has made great efforts to extend the cooperation among nato countries to include the political economic and cultural fields lester_pearson would be the last to believe that military force can secure peace in the long_run this is what he said in 1955 no person no nation no group of nations can view with comfort however the prospects for a world where peace rests primarily on the deterrent effect of collective military strength and regional political unity that discomfort becomes deep anxiety in the face of the fantastic development of nuclear_weapons and their inclusion in the armament of a few big powers now and of many other powers soon this makes it more_than ever necessary while maintaining military strength to put forth any possible effort to reduce the danger of war and gradually make such strength unnecessary in all the long story of mankind arms alone however powerful have never been sufficient to guarantee security for any length of time your strength for defense becomes the weakness of those against whom you feel you must be ready to defend yourself your security becomes their insecurity so they in turn seek safety in increased arms a vicious_circle commences which in the past has cost untold misery and destruction and might now if we cannot cut through it cause mankind's extinction even adequate collective force for defence then is no final solution it is merely a means to an end peace based_on something more enduring than force lester pearson's vision is not that of a dreamer he looks at life and the conditions of the world as they are basing his conclusions on realities one may say that his visionary ideal has been constructed of the materials of experience i have had to confine myself to some of the main features of lester bowles pearson's activities to prevent or to stop war and i_am quite aware that i have given only an account of the result of his efforts and not a living picture of the man himself that however is not easy to do in the case of a man like lester_pearson whose work has been carried_out largely on the diplomatic level in commissions at meetings and during discussions of an informal character only those_who have taken part in conferences together with lester_pearson have been able to witness his never tiring determination and his exceptional ability to put_forward constructive ideas for the solution of a problem if his proposal was rejected he optimistically proceeded to engage his resourcefulness in finding another solution for which thanks to the experience just gained he might perhaps more readily win acceptance for him the main thing was never to give up but always to try to advance at least one step toward the goal lester_pearson is far from being a compromising man when a vital point is at issue however he feels that the basis of any negotiations on international problems must be an attempt to understand the other party and to meet him halfway in order to establish a basis of confidence it is only when confidence has been built up that it is possible to proceed with the negotiations with any hope of reconciliation however in this work one must never betray the principles on which the united_nations charter is based in other words one must work toward economic and social progress and away from poverty toward full and free self government and away from dictatorial regimes imposed from inside or from outside toward a progressive realization of human_rights and the dignity and worth of the individual person lester_pearson believes that the time will come when it is possible through the united_nations to realize the dream of a worldwide community of all nations and races and he feels that just acknowledging such an ideal in some form serves to remind us of our ultimate and underlying kinship even with our opponents there is a value to this which if we retain any humility we will not underestimate lester pearson's work has been carried on during a period of tension and open conflict not only among nations but between races and different civilizations at the same_time technical development has brought countries closer together and made them more mutually dependent upon one another any conflict that breaks out anywhere today will involve practically the whole world we are now emerging into an age lester_pearson says when different civilizations will have to learn to live side by side in peaceful interchange learning from each_other studying each other's history and ideals art and culture mutually enriching each other's lives the only alternative in this overcrowded little world is misunderstanding tension clash and catastrophe the fact that the world may have to face the choice between to be and not to be and the fact that it has been left to us ourselves to decide whether life or death shall prevail make it more necessary than ever before that we choose the right way we must not let any conceivable method remain untried in our efforts to solve international conflicts in a peaceful way here the goal will not be reached unless the people whose task it is to resolve the conflicts show no sign of failing in their will for peace and in their efforts to attain it as lester_pearson has expressed it in our day the penalty for failure or for serious blundering is far greater than ever before mankind can no_longer afford error and still no matter how dark the outlook for the world may be lester_pearson is no pessimist had he been pessimistic he could not have found the endurance and strength which he has displayed in his work his efforts would not have been possible had he not been supported by a strong faith in the final victory of the good forces of life in conclusion i quote from a lecture which lester_pearson gave at princeton university in 1955 the fact is that to every challenge given by the threat of death and destruction there has always been the response from free men it shall not be by these responses man has not only saved himself but has ensured his future may it be so again this time as we face the awful and the glorious possibilities of the nuclear age 1 convened in february 1932 under the aegis of the league of nations the conference was deadlocked several times in 1932 and 1933 on the issue of german equality and with germany's withdrawal from the conference and the league in october 1933 came to a virtual halt despite some later meetings 2 the conference resulted in agreement among england france and the u.s on certain naval limitations but not until after japan and italy had withdrawn from the conference 3 meeting in hot springs va in 1943 this un conference set_up the interim commission which eventually drafted the constitution for the food and agriculture organization fao formally established in 1945 and affiliated with the un in 1946 4 united_nations relief and rehabilitation_administration 5 the long standing dispute between the arab and jewish peoples involved in this question has yet as of october 1971 to be satisfactorily settled 6 north korea's attack on south_korea in june 1950 initiated the korean war 1950 1953 between north_korea and after november 1950 communist china on the one hand and south_korea and un forces on the other 7 this uprising of the hungarian people against the communist controlled government began october 23 1956 and by november 8 had been effectively suppressed by the russian army 8 the north atlantic treaty organization defensive alliance established in 1949 the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament has this year awarded the nobel peace_prize to the belgian dominican father georges_pire for his efforts to help refugees to leave their camps and return to a life of freedom and dignity father_pire's work is known to all of us in western europe we have read in the newspapers of this man who on his own initiative has set himself the task of rescuing the handicapped refugees the hard core or the residue these are the old and infirm who remained in the camps doomed to stay there without hope of a brighter future men for whom our hard ruthless world which has taken efficiency and working capacity as its idols has had no further use just seven weeks ago we in oslo had the pleasure of hearing father_pire speak of his work for these refugees1 his talk in the great hall of the university was reported in the national press so most of us in norway are acquainted with both the practical ventures he has launched and the difficulties which he has encountered father_pire told us then that his aim was not merely to rescue individuals from material want but also to restore to each of these unfortunate human_beings the self confidence dulled by the many years languished away in refugee camps as everyone must know the refugee_problem in the form and magnitude which we know today is a legacy of the two world wars it is one of the blackest stains on the twentieth century but a great_deal has also been done for the refugees when the last war ended in 1945 the united_nations relief and rehabilitation_administration was charged with the care of the homeless later on its duties were taken over by the international refugee organization both of these organizations have since been dissolved and the mission was in turn entrusted to the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees whose achievements have been and still are vitally important it was in recognition of these that this institution was awarded the nobel peace_prize in 1955 for 1954 in my speech on that occasion i tried to describe the work which was being done to secure a legal position for the refugees to help them to find work in the countries in which they had settled or as the high_commissioner dr.van heuven_goedhart expressed it then to give every_single refugee an economic legal and social foundation that would enable him to build_up a new life by his own efforts but even in 1955 ten_years after the end of the war there were still 300,000 refugees in europe 70,000 of these living in camps the high_commissioner told me at the time that he was driven to despair by the many obstacles he encountered in his work and most difficult of all was to overcome the extreme reluctance to accept the refugees regarded simply as unwelcome foreigners a great_deal has been done since then to ease their lot not least by the numerous private refugee organizations existing in various countries of the western world but the most difficult problem of all still remains that of rescuing all those_who can be saved only by the help which one human being can give to another by creating the personal contact necessary to restore to the refugee the faith and confidence that he will again be able to live as a human being among others it is to this labor that father_pire has devoted himself and it is here that his great contribution lies father_pire himself tells_us that it was on february 27 1949 when he was thirty nine years old that he suddenly became poignantly aware of the refugee_problem until that day he had as a dominican priest been actively engaged in helping the suffering and especially the children but a conversation with a colonel in unrra awakened him to the plight of the refugees and he began to ask himself what he could personally do to save some of the displaced_persons who were still detained in the camps and who were in the majority old and infirm with little hope of building up a new existence for themselves and their families by their own endeavor it is obvious that effective help for this category of refugee must be very difficult because it is to all intents and purposes impossible to think in terms of loans the arrangement frequently adopted in the case of the young emigrant refugees who were fit and trained for work help for the old people must at least to begin with be built entirely on men's unselfish desire to help their fellowmen on their will to give practical proof of compassion and love father_pire began with an attempt to establish a sponsorship scheme that is to say he tried to place refugee families living in the camps in contact_with private individuals or godparents who were willing to write to them send parcels and perhaps money today 15,000 godparents from twenty countries correspond with 15,000 refugees in other words refugees have been put in touch with people outside the camps who they know have a kind thought for them just imagine what joy the arrival of letters and parcels must bring to them they have in this way a tangible proof of someone's willingness to reach out a helping_hand but and this is a big but their own place is still in the camps and only in the camps by visiting the refugees father_pire has learned to know what this means and so in 1950 he began his work to help the refugees to leave the camps in the first place there was the problem of the old people within four years he had succeeded in founding four homes for the old people all in belgium where they to use father_pire's own words are left in peace to dream of their lost homeland here they are provided with shelter clothing food medicine and here they will be cared for until they die it can be seen then that father_pire's faith in the goodness of men his confidence in their capacity to show compassion for their fellows have proved to be well founded for all these homes for the aged are the result of voluntary work and of donations of money from private individuals but at the back of it all stands the personality of georges_pire who has managed to awaken in others the urge to help those in need that was the beginning but most of us know how father_pire's work expanded how he both by his own efforts and with the help of others like him has in the past three years founded his five european villages for refugees the first in aachen one in bregenz in austria a third in augsburg the fourth near brussels is named after fridtjof_nansen and on september 21 of this year in the saar was laid the foundation stone for the latest village which is to bear the name of albert_schweitzer father_pire had in 1950 formed a society named aid to displaced_persons l'aide aux personnes déplacées this was a belgian organization and had its headquarters in georges pire's home village of huy the society became an international organization in 1957 and after father_pire had embarked on his scheme for european villages rapidly broadened its scope of activity article iii of its statutes provides as follows the society has as its aim to provide stateless refugees regardless of their nationality or religion with material or moral support in every form and especially through assistance by sponsorship nursing homes and european villages and to forge a chain of forces for good around the refugees who are without country in the form of europe of the heart the society is run by an administrative council composed of seven members at present two belgians one german one austrian one frenchman one swiss and one from luxembourg the president of the society and chairman of the council is georges_pire at the present time the organization has branches in belgium austria germany france luxembourg and switzerland and national secretariats in denmark and italy as i have said father_pire's homes for the old owe their existence to voluntary work and to donations from individuals in fact when building these homes georges_pire had to give an undertaking to the belgian government that he would not ask for help from official sources the same conditions were imposed on his subsequent work which has been financed solely from private contributions is it then surprising that father_pire spends a large part of his time in raising money for his projects for father_pire never begs and we must remember that the vast proportion of the cash received is donated in small sums from people of average income shortly before the belgian society was transformed into an international organization father_pire and his closest collaborators had founded another society whose aim was the relief of every form of distress in whatever part of the world it might arise this organization took the name europe of the heart in the service of the world l'europe du coeur au service du monde and invited all countries to become members without regard to any division whether of frontier or religion language or culture in this way it has progressed far_beyond the refugee work in europe for now father_pire appeals to all that is best in the west european exhorting him to promote the feeling of brotherhood_among men and asking him to face his responsibilities to the inhabitants of the rest of the world i have tried to give a brief outline of father_pire's work his sponsorship scheme for refugees his homes for the old and his european villages i have described his intentions in creating europe of the heart in the service of the world if his achievement is judged solely on the number of refugees he has rescued then some might say that it is not great but as is so often the case it would be dangerous to judge on the basis of numbers alone of far greater importance are the spirit which has animated georges_pire in his mission and the seed he has sown in the hearts of men for they give us the hope of a harvest to come man's selfless work for his needy fellowman at the age of eighteen georges_pire entered the dominican monastery of la sarte in belgium his training consisted of one year's novitiate three years of philosophical studies and four years of theological studies his interest in social problems directed him to the study of sociology and having taken his doctorate in 1936 he studied moral philosophy and sociology at louvain university thus far georges_pire had followed the path trodden by so many other dominicans the dominican order according to one of its members has always been very intellectual in character and is marked by the pursuit of study and learning especially in the fields of philosophy and theology the order has therefore always had close connections with university life his studies reading and work at the university seem to have meant a great_deal to father_pire university life should give a person a wider horizon and make him less bound by dogma but intellectualism can often become sterile and turn a man into an onlooker remote from the world of reality father_pire however did not withdraw into the shell of the intellectual his university life seems to have left him free from narrow dogmatism in his attitude to men but apart from this it is assuredly something much deeper something quite unconnected with learning which has inspired father_pire in his work might this not be his profound desire to give practical expression to his love for his fellowmen in his speech here in oslo father_pire said that each human being is of infinite value that love is our greatest asset on this earth and that we give it concrete form by practicing it in our relations with each individual he sees it in this way try by loving your neighbor to reach the individual person this is what he has tried to achieve by his method of helping the refugees through sponsors homes for the old and the villages there may perhaps be some who find it difficult to understand that the best way to help the refugees can be to build villages i have heard it said that to collect refugees in villages is to isolate them from the society into which their children must one day grow up it may appear so but then we must remember that the refugees whom father_pire wishes to rescue are not the healthy and the young ones his refugee friends isolated and alone as they are cannot be thrown suddenly into new and foreign surroundings to make their own way here in oslo father_pire said of his refugees they have been sitting on their luggage and waiting twelve or fourteen years for a train that never comes it is for them that father_pire's villages are intended so that carefully little by little they may be blended into the new society while still feeling secure and protected against the prejudice and ill will with which foreigners are often received father_pire has named two of his villages after fridtjof_nansen and albert_schweitzer he frequently refers to nansen a man who was never a member of any particular church but who in his great work for refugees for prisoners of war for the victims of the famine in russia followed the precept of brotherly_love albert_schweitzer too has lived his whole life by the same principle applying it to everything he has done although he has never been a believer in dogmas in the eyes of father_pire all are in the service of good who without regard for religion color or nationality carry_out their work in this troubled world of ours in the spirit of brotherly_love father_pire's work for the refugees was undertaken to heal the wounds of war but he looks much further ahead for as he has said himself our aim must be to erect a bridge of light and love high above the waves of colonialism anti colonialism and racial strife indeed we must do more_than that we must by our actions spread the gospel of brotherhood_among men nations and races this is the ideal expressed by alfred_nobel in his testament when he decreed that the peace_prize should be awarded to the one who has done the most or the best work for the cause of brotherhood_among nations for this reason the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament is today pleased and honored to present the peace_prize for 1958 to father georges_pire 1 the laureate was then in oslo to speak at a meeting of the norwegian chapter of the european movement frequently when the storm clouds gather perhaps for that very reason the world is made aware of the forces of good rallying to meet the threatened danger the dark years of this century in europe started in 1914 and are still with us throughout this span of time for forty five_years philip john noel_baker has dedicated his efforts to the service of suffering humanity whether in time of war or in the intervals between wars but above_all else his efforts to prevent war breaking out have been tireless and ceaseless we saw philip_noel baker as a young man serving in the quaker ambulance unit in france and italy during the first world war we saw him standing at fridtjof_nansen s side during the latter's great work of relief in russia and greece he continued after the second_world war to try to solve the refugee_problem that the war had created and throughout this time ever_since the armistice of 1918 we have heard him proclaiming the cause of disarmament and peace what disappointments we have suffered since then and yet not for a moment did it occur to noel_baker to abandon hope that in the future it would be possible to find a solution to political conflicts not by arms but through negotiation philip_noel baker is probably today the man who possesses the greatest store of knowledge on the subject of disarmament and who best knows the difficulties involved in his latest book published in 1958 the arms_race which he has called a programme for world disarmament he has pointed_out the way we should go we detect in philip_noel baker scarcely a trace of ambition for himself for him the cause and it alone matters if that can be furthered it is a matter of indifference to him who gets the credit so marked is this selfless and idealistic attitude that it is difficult to explain unless one knows something about the milieu in which he was brought up for generations his family has belonged to the society of friends or quakers his father joseph allen baker was born in canada where the family had emigrated from ireland in 1819 in the late 1870 s allen baker was sent by his father to england to take charge of a newly established branch of the family business there he married the deeply religious elizabeth balmer moscrip their son philip john was born in 1889 allen baker's life in england helps to explain the milieu which must have been largely responsible for shaping his son's character and selfless constructive attitude to life inspired by the quakers feeling of responsibility for brothers in need and by their eagerness to help allen baker devoted his time to a wide range of welfare activities in the london familiar to us after the end of the nineteenth century he came into close contact_with the london slums establishing schools and even teaching personally those_who could not read and write as well as working for improved housing temperance and better traffic conditions in the course of time this work led to his becoming a member of the london county council from 1900 to 1918 he was a member of parliament where he was to be found in the radical wing of the liberal party as a politician he devoted most of his time to work for peace as the fatal year of 1914 loomed ominously near he was indefatigable in his work to forge links between peace lovers in all countries with his religious background and approach he considered it essential that christians in different countries should unite to oppose war especially those in germany and england allen baker's efforts proved in vain and 1914 arrived instead of giving way to doubts and dismay he was inspired anew by woodrow_wilson s idea of a league of nations there is little doubt that the influence and inspiration of a cultured and harmonious family life with father and mother working selflessly to help those in need inevitably left their mark on the son's attitude to life philip_noel baker had the advantage of an academic education something his father had lacked all his life his schooling commenced at a quaker school in york in 1906 at the age of seventeen he studied at haverford college in pennsylvania and from 1908 to 1912 he was an undergraduate at cambridge university his major subject was international_law in which he has a degree he also studied at the sorbonne and in munich during the year preceding the first world war he was cassel professor of international relations at london university from 1924 to 1929 i have mentioned his education because his academic schooling was to have considerable influence on his later work in all he has said and written he has never succumbed to the temptation of making a statement that was not well founded on meticulous documentation he never brushes the arguments of his opponents aside but submits them to an unbiased examination and criticism he endeavors to understand those_who do not agree with him he does_not censure their views and only after he has proved that their position is untenable does he deliver judgment noel_baker was twenty six years old when the first world war began as a quaker he was against taking an active_part in the war he formed the quakers ambulance unit and served in it himself behind the front lines in france in italy he served with the british ambulance unit under trevelyan1 noel_baker's entire bent of mind his upbringing his experience of war all these things must inevitably have drawn him as soon as the war was over to the work directed at righting some of the wrongs created by the war above_all he must have felt himself called upon to do everything in his power to prevent any new wars it was therefore natural that he should seek association with the new international organization the league of nations those_who never knew the years after the first world war will find it hard to realize how many hopes were pinned to the league of nations for the first time an association of states had been formed an institution whose aim was the prevention of war and the promotion of international cooperation in every possible sphere especially in welfare in health and in the economic area many people saw in the league an instrument for creating a new age even_though such countries as russia germany and the united_states were not members the league they believed would realize a hope which most people at that time cherished the hope that this had been the war to end war soon after the cessation of hostilities noel_baker was posted to the section of the foreign office dealing with plans for the league of nations in 1919 he accompanied sir robert cecil as his secretary to the peace negotiations in paris he assisted in drafting the covenant of the league of nations and of the international labor organization shortly afterwards he was appointed head of the mandate section of the league of nations in 1920 an important era in noel_baker's life began this was the year his work with fridtjof_nansen started work which was to last as long as nansen lived there is no need for me to mention nansen's tremendous humanitarian work in russia in greece and in asia minor this is known to all of us but i should like to emphasize that in all this work noel_baker participated not only as a helper but as nansen's friend i have had the opportunity of going through some of the correspondence between these two men during this period and it sheds a great_deal of light on the contribution made by noel_baker he worked unobtrusively away from the glare of publicity continuing to act as nansen's adviser during the years the latter represented norway in the league of nations writing to him in 1927 nansen says my dear baker i feel ashamed i should have written to you long ago to thank_you with all my heart for your coming to geneva and for the splendid help you gave me you know well enough what it means for me but it was always like that i do not know how i could have got on without you of course all i have done in the league has been done with you and could not have been done without you at least not in the manner it was achieved and so it has been from the very beginning and till now oh dear friend how much you have done for me and for the league during many years and how much time you have given to it i only wish this work for others could give you more personal satisfaction it is well enough to work unselfishly for high ideals but still as we live in this world it would be gratifying at least to others to see the workers get their due here in norway we are too apt to think of noel_baker only as nansen's assistant and friend but this part of his life is only one of many chapters from the time the letter i have quoted was written and up to the present more_than three decades have passed years which for noel_baker have been filled with unflagging work for disarmament although noel_baker spent a comparatively short time as an official of the league of nations he continued actively in the work of the league first as sir robert cecil's personal adviser at the meetings of the council and in the assembly later in disarmament work as adviser to arthur_henderson and finally in the disarmament commission from 1931 to 1933 he also followed the work of the league of nations in other fields he has recorded his experiences and his personal views on the major questions under discussion at that time in his books the geneva_protocol 1925 disarmament 1926 the coolidge conference 1927 and the private manufacture of armaments 1936 which of us today remembers the geneva protocol2 and the discussions it aroused then as now it was the fear of handing over any part of one's national sovereignty as well as the misgivings of the experts that killed the protocol the situation at that time was such that the protocol might have laid the basis for arbitration and confidence which in turn would have facilitated disarmament as noel_baker himself writes our generation must get rid of the militarization of the world and above_all of europe which the preceding generation thrust upon it it is a deep rooted and malignant disease for which palliatives do not suffice and of which civilized society may die if it be not ended 3 but the protocol which was truly a step in the right direction was quietly shelved and left to molder with other documents for then as now noel_baker's words applied those_who believe that international institutions can be made and have been made to work want now to go forward those_who doubt it hesitate 4 it was the latter who triumphed on this occasion in his book disarmament noel_baker discusses all the aspects of the question and expresses the view that international disarmament lies within the bounds of possibility being the realist that he is however he devotes considerable space to the difficulties which disarmament will encounter chief among them being the acceptance of reciprocal control he says it will no_doubt be thought by many that such a scheme will never in fact be generally accepted because it would involve a sacrifice of military liberty to which no government in present day conditions can be expected to agree 5 to those_who hold this opinion he replies and are there not new overriding interests which for all governments now that a great new international policy is by their common consent to be adopted should come before the old shibboleths of freedom and secrecy in military preparation shibboleths which so far be it noted have failed to bring us security from war 6 in his book the private manufacture of armaments noel_baker has collected a wealth of material to reveal the role this industry has played at that time a great many people believed that private ownership of the armaments industry was a material factor in provoking rearmament they maintained that once private ownership could be abolished and the armaments industry run by the state one of the most_important reasons for the armaments race would be removed developments have shown that the situation has hardly improved with the state as owner but noel_baker's book points out that the reason the private armaments industry played as important a role as it did was that it worked hand in glove with the government of the country then as now it was the policy of the state that proved decisive all that noel_baker has written reflects his tremendous depth of knowledge and the soundness shrewdness and eminent common sense of his views give his books a value far_beyond the age in which they were written and yet it is not through his writing but in his personal activities that noel_baker has made his greatest contribution i do not think it an exaggeration to say that he has had some share in practically all the work that has been carried_out to promote international understanding in its widest sense and this is true of him both as a private individual and as a representative of his country it would be impossible to do full justice to his manifold activities in this connection without recapitulating in detail important sections of the history of the league of nations and of international politics during the interwar years a task that would make my speech interminable in 1929 noel_baker was elected to the house of commons as a labor member and in the 1930_s he was one of the labor party's foremost spokesmen in advancing the view that england in her foreign_policy should follow the lines laid_down by the league of nations this attitude was reflected as on other occasions in his bitter resistance to the suggestion that england should abandon her sanctions against italy after mussolini's invasion of ethiopia7 he was against england's policy of nonintervention in the spanish civil war8 and he criticized the vacillating attitude of the british government toward nazism he was himself a member of a group led by churchill which tried to organize resistance against fascist and nazi encroachment in order to give moral support to threatened nations he visited czechoslovakia as a representative of the labor party and subsequently finland in his own_country noel_baker helped to found the league of nations union and was one of the most active members of the peace movement which enjoyed tremendous support in the 1930_s but in the 1920 s and 1930_s noel_baker's work was still focused in and around the league of nations few if any have done so much to make the league of nations known and to get people to understand its significance and to support it in his excellent little book the league of nations at work published in 1926 he has provided a clear account of the idea behind the league of nations its organization and its work and what it had achieved up to that time he long sustained a hopeful faith in the league's importance for the future he says it is fair to hope then that in the institutions of the league there is a sound foundation for whatever more complicated system of international government the future may require 9 but he does_not ignore the possibility that such hope may come to nothing but there is one doubt about the future of the league which may give pause even to the most hopeful of observers it is this will its institutions be given a real chance to build_up their strength before the catastrophe of a new world war sweeps them all away will the forces of international cooperation and of mutual confidence which the league is bringing into life be strong_enough to hold in check the forces of militarism hatred suspicion and revenge 10 as we all know the league of nations was swept away by nazism and hitler there are many today who have forgotten the work of the league of nations and there are those_who reproach the league for failing to hold in check the storm that was brewing in the 1930_s this has made them pessimistic and has robbed them of faith in the future what's the use they ask noel_baker has refused to give way to pessimism and despondency although he was forced to watch so much that he had worked hard for during most of his adult years crumble away before his eyes he has since 1945 set out once_again to do battle for the selfsame ideals that the league of nations represented in 1942 he had been made a member of churchill's government and in 1945 he served under attlee11 he was named british representative on the preparatory commission of the united_nations organization with his wealth of experience from the league of nations he exercised considerable influence on the form given to the recommendations which laid the groundwork for the organization of the united_nations and its various sections and of the separate organizations affiliated with it such as the food and agriculture organization he also promoted the establishment of the international refugee organization iro and submitted proposals for setting_up a separate economic commission for europe12 to mention some of his more outstanding achievements during this period he acted as a member of the british government but there is no_doubt that he was personally responsible to a large_extent for the wording and form of many of the proposals and he must be credited with the fact that they were taken up by the british side his work as a member of the british government covers a great_deal more_than this it was noel_baker who directed negotiations with india ireland and newfoundland and it is widely accepted that he was largely responsible for the successful issue of negotiations with india which probably constituted the most_important of these problems it would be impossible to go into all the international missions noel_baker has had let_me merely mention that he participated actively in the work of the relief organization unrra13 and that he represented the united kingdom in work in the world health_organization and in the un economic and social council when attlee's government went out of office noel_baker's work as a representative of his country's government was at an end but as a member of the labor shadow cabinet he has played an important role proving to be one of the leading opposition speakers on questions of foreign_policy we vividly recall his speech during the debate on the suez action of 1956 which he strongly condemned chiefly because the british government had acted on its own without having recourse to the united nations14 in 1958 appeared what i think we are justified in calling noel_baker's most_important work the arms_race in it he deals with every aspect of the disarmament problem with its sound and expert reasoning and its carefully supported appraisals of the difficulties to be encountered in any attempt to solve the problem of disarmament this book makes a profound impression it is impossible in a few words to give an adequate idea of this work of the author's vivid description of the arms_race and of the arms of modern times not only of those which go by the common name of nuclear_weapons but also of chemical and biological weapons he traces all the attempts that have been made to reach an agreement on disarmament since the first world war and describes the repeated efforts to find an effective system of control acceptable to all parties he shows how all these attempts failed because of lack of trust and because no one was willing to accept outside supervision within his own_country while noel_baker is of the opinion that up to 1955 the soviet attitude was responsible for this failure he is inclined to think that the west has subsequently proved too adamant in its demands we should he maintains believe that the soviet_union today is in earnest when it states that it is prepared to disarm disarmament must be complete and must include all kinds of weapons if it is to be effective in his book noel_baker deals with the possibilities that exist for carrying_out effective control and makes a number of definite and concrete proposals not only for disarmament but also for mutual control instead of dismissing the objections that are made he counters them with pertinent facts above_all he believes that we must accept the risk that a control system may not prove to be completely watertight since this risk is a small one compared to that involved in merely drifting aimlessly along as we are doing today noel_baker emphasizes the importance of developing any system of collective security through the united_nations nowhere in this book or in explaining his views does he fail to back up his statements with well founded facts noel_baker repeatedly emphasizes that the arms_race in itself is one of the main causes of war if one country arms the confidence of other countries is undermined and their feeling of being in danger is increased as a result they in their turn proceed to arm for no government dare jeopardize its country's safety by failing to take the necessary precautions which are a direct consequence of its neighbors arming to the teeth in this way the arms_race is kept going in every country insofar as possible he uses statistics to show how the tempo of this race has accelerated in recent_years in view of the tremendous fund of experience he has gained from working with these very problems in the interwar years it would be naive to believe that noel_baker is convinced that the problem of disarmament is easily solved the main point is that he considers it within the realm of possibility as we all know disarmament today depends primarily on whether west and east can agree to a control system noel_baker believes that the possibility of this coming about is greater today than at any time since 1945 his optimism has been strengthened by conversations he had in 1958 in moscow with khrushchev and mikoyan15 from them he received the impression that they are in earnest when they speak of disarmament but he says their sincerity can only be tested by offering them the detailed text of a controlled disarmament system that would translate into reality the measures which they say they will accept 16 some people have accused noel_baker of being too starry eyed in his attitude to the disarmament problem to such critics he says no one who has closely followed disarmament negotiations since 1919 is likely to be guilty of facile optimism about the prospect of success but no one who understands the present arms_race should be guilty of facile pessimism which is by far the graver fault defeatism about the feasibility of plans for disarmament and ordered peace has been the most calamitous of all the errors made by democratic governments in modern times 17 there will always be pessimists among us people filled with misgivings these are seldom the people who improve the world this can be done only if hope and faith stimulate men to new attempts when old attempts fail and to new ways and means when old ways and means do not succeed philip_noel baker is a man cast in this mold throughout his life he has been true to the high ideal of the quakers to help his fellowmen without regard to race or creed he has striven to build a world in which violence and arms are no_longer necessary in the struggle for existence either among men or among nations throughout the years despite disappointments and setbacks philip john noel_baker has never admitted defeat but has looked steadfastly to the future toward a new and better world 1 george macaulay trevelyan 1876 1967 well_known english historian and cambridge professor commanded a british

posthumously to dag_hammarskjöld in many respects these two recipients differ widely albert_john lutuli's life and work have been molded by the pattern of the african tribal community and by the influence of christianity while dag hammarskjöld's were a product of western culture lutuli's activities have been and are confined to his own_country while dag_hammarskjöld worked in the international sphere yet despite these differences they had one thing in common both fought to implant the idea of justice in the individual in the nation and among the nations or we might put it like this they fought for the ideals expressed in the declaration of human_rights embodied in the charter of the united_nations albert_john lutuli was born in 1898 he comes from a long line of zulu chiefs but he was influenced by christianity in his school days and in his later education first in the american mission school he attended and afterwards during his training as a teacher after passing his examination at adams college in natal he became a faculty member of the college where he taught among other subjects the history of the zulu people during his seventeen years as a teacher he took no part in the political life of south_africa in 1935 a great change took_place in lutuli's life when he was called to assume the functions of tribal chief the choice of a chief must be approved by the state which pays his salary it was on the basis of this authority that the government was able to remove him in 1952 his seventeen years as a chief brought him daily contact_with the individual members of the tribal community as well as an active_part in the work of the christian church in south_africa in india and in the united_states both as a teacher and later as a chief lutuli did outstanding work he took his duties as chief very seriously and in doing so won the affection of his tribe he endeavored to blend its ancient culture with the precepts of christianity and to promote its economic welfare in various ways for example by introducing new methods of sugar production describing this period of his life he tells_us previous to being a chief i was a school teacher for about seventeen years in these past thirty_years or so i have striven with tremendous zeal and patience to work for the progress and welfare of my people and for their harmonious relations with other sections of our multiracial society in the union of south_africa in this effort i always pursued the path of moderation over this great length of time i have year after year gladly spent hours of my time with such organizations as the church and its various agencies such as the christian council of south_africa the joint council of europeans and africans and the now defunct native representative council 1 but it was neither as a teacher nor as a chief nor as an active member of various christian organizations that he took a focal position in what was to be his great effort in the post war years the forces that induced albert_john lutuli to abandon his tranquil educational activities and enter politics were unleashed by the increasing pressure which the ruling white race exerted on members of other races in south_africa in 1944 he became a member of the african_national congress an organization founded in 1912 in 1952 he was elected its president an office he held until the congress was banned in 1960 it is first and foremost for the work he carried on during these years from the 1940s to the present that we honor him today to get some idea of lutuli's achievements we must know something of the society in which he worked the white population of south_africa settled there in the latter half of the seventeenth century the first settlers were french huguenots followed later by dutch farmers they cleared the land and their descendants the boers have lived there ever_since they look upon the country as their fatherland they have no other the english settlers who arrived on the scene at the end of the eighteenth century maintained close contact_with their mother country the first natives whom the dutch pioneers met were hottentots and bushmen the hottentots have now virtually disappeared as a separate racial entity but through intermarriage with european and other races they have contributed in large measure to the racial characteristics of those so_called the colored people when the boers moved into the interior they encountered other native tribes among them the zulus whom they fought and conquered these tribes constitute the largest part of the population of south_africa today in the course of time other racial elements were added the dutch imported a number of malays from the east indies as slaves while the british introduced indian labor to the sugar plantations in the nineteenth century two communities took shape the boer republics of transvaal2 and the orange free state and the british colony of south_africa both ruled by whites at the turn of the century these two communities fought the boer war of 1899 1902 from which britain finally emerged victorious the ultimate result was that the union of south_africa was set_up as an independent british dominion in 1901 at that time the outside world heard little about relations_between whites and nonwhites during the fifty_years that have since elapsed south_africa in common with so many other countries has developed from an agricultural community into one in which mining industry trade and other such operations now predominate as in other such countries the urban population has increased rapidly the present day population of south_africa is some 14.7 million of whom only some 3.3 million are white of the remainder 9.6 million are africans some 0.4 million asian mainly indians and 1.4 million of mixed race the so_called colored people of the 9.6 million africans some 3.3 million live in the agricultural districts of the whites a large proportion of them as agricultural workers on white farms 3.7 million live in the african reservations and 2.6 million live in the towns although some of these figures are only approximate they still present a picture of a community whose economy and therefore future are dependent on cooperation between all races the figures testify to the fact that people of all races have helped to build this community the whites could never have done it alone this is an incontestable fact but what is the position of the nonwhite population in this community nonwhites are denied all right to participate in the government of the state they are discriminated against legally economically and socially and this discrimination between whites and nonwhites has grown steadily during the postwar years the aim of those now ruling the country is to draw a line between the two communities between whites and nonwhites despite the fact that the march of events has clearly shown that the whole community has been developed by the efforts of all races i cannot here go into the network of laws and regulations passed in order to maintain the barrier between whites and nonwhites the purpose of these laws is to restrict and regulate every facet of the life of the nonwhite he has no vote he has no part in determining his own status under the pass system he is deprived not only of the right to live where he likes but also of the right to choose his employer he has virtually no redress against police tyranny he is not entitled to the same schooling or education as the white and any sexual relation between white and nonwhite entails punishment for both parties an african christian is frequently not allowed to worship god under the same roof as a white christian in short nonwhites are treated as a subject race is it surprising then that the nonwhites have protested against such treatment what is surprising is that the protest has not been accompanied by acts of violence on their part their patience is remarkable their moral strength in the struggle boundless it was the discrimination between white and nonwhite that prompted nonwhite africans in 1912 to establish the african_national congress its founders were nonwhite africans who had obtained a higher education either abroad or at home in the days when they still had the opportunity to do so at first the african_national congress tried to influence political development by means of petitions and deputations to the authorities but when the attempt proved fruitless and new laws restricting the rights of nonwhites were passed the african_national congress adopted a more active line especially after 1949 it was in the mid 1940s that lutuli began to participate in this work of the african_national congress of which he became a member in 1944 he was elected to the committee of the natal section in 1945 and in 1951 became president of the natal section in december 1952 he was elected_president of the entire african_national congress a position he retained until the organization was banned by the government in 1960 it was during these transitional years of adopting stronger action based_on boycotts defiance campaigns and strikes that lutuli came to influence so profoundly the african_national congress he says himself that the congress never passed any specific resolution to the effect that its struggle was to be pursued by nonviolent means actually however it has been waged with peaceful_means a policy at all times supported by the congress administration lutuli himself has always been categorically opposed to the use of violence within the organization he has had to overcome opposition from two different quarters from the older members who supported the more passive approach and from those members mainly the younger ones who wanted to make south_africa an entirely nonwhite state as a result of lutuli's participation in the more active struggle of the african_national congress the government presented him with an ultimatum he must either renounce his position as a chief or give up his seat in the congress he refused to comply with either of these alternatives and was immediately deposed as chief whereupon he issued his significant declaration entitled the chief speaks which concludes with the words the road to freedom is via the cross in his declaration he says what have been the fruits of my many years of moderation has there been any reciprocal tolerance or moderation from the government be it nationalist or united party no on the contrary the past thirty_years have seen the greatest number of laws restricting our rights and progress until today we have reached a stage where we have almost no rights at all no adequate land for our occupation our only asset cattle dwindling no security of homes no decent and remunerative employment more restrictions to freedom of movement through passes curfew regulations influx control measures in short we have witnessed in these years an intensification of our subjection to ensure and protect white supremacy it is with this background and with a full sense of responsibility that under the auspices of the african_national congress natal i have joined my people in the new spirit that moves them today the spirit that revolts openly and boldly against injustice and expresses itself in a determined and nonviolent manner the african_national congress its nonviolent passive resistance campaign may be of nuisance value to the government but it is not subversive since it does_not seek to overthrow the form and machinery of the state but only urges for the inclusion of all sections of the community in a partnership in the government of the country on the basis of equality laws and conditions that tend to debase human personality a god given force be they brought about by the state or other individuals must be relentlessly opposed in the spirit of defiance shown by st peter when he said to the rulers of his day shall we obey god or man no one can deny that insofar as nonwhites are concerned in the union of south_africa laws and conditions that debase human personality abound any chief worthy of his position must fight fearlessly against such debasing conditions and laws it is inevitable that in working for freedom some individuals and some families must take the lead and suffer the road to freedom is via the cross in 1952 after he had been dismissed from his position as chief and had been elected_president of the african_national congress he was forbidden to leave his home district for two years 3 in 1954 he went to johannesburg to address a meeting which had been called to protest the forced evacuation of colored people from sophiatown to meadowsland he was refused permission to speak and was banned for another period of two years from leaving his home district in 1956 together with 155 other persons he was arrested and charged with high treason in 1957 the charge against him and sixty four others was withdrawn the rest were all acquitted in 1961 in 1959 lutuli took_part in several mass meetings but was again subjected to a travel ban this time for a period of five_years in 1960 there was a large mass demonstration against the pass regulations which led to the events in sharpeville where police fired on the crowd killing and wounding many a state of emergency was declared and wholesale arrests were made lutuli who had been summoned as a witness in the treason trial which had dragged on ever_since 1956 was among those arrested but was allowed to give evidence in the trial during the last year he has lived at home debarred from leaving his village and from taking part in any meetings moreover he is now no_longer president of the african_national congress for this organization as already_mentioned was dissolved by order of the government in april 1960 he now lives in his village deprived of freedom of movement and of the right to speak in open debate but he still maintains his avowed policy expressing his views in articles published in the newspaper post 4 just before the travel ban was imposed on him in december 1919 the year before the union of south_africa was to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its foundation he wrote a long article entitled fifty_years of union a political review which he sent to the south_africa institute of race relations 5 this presents as far as i know the clearest and the most complete statement of his position concerning the policy pursued by the government of south_africa in this article his attack on the policies of the south_african government is stronger and more detailed than before this discussion and attack on the policy of apartheid and its plan that the nonwhite community should develop along its own lines is new he asks who has drawn the lines the answer is not those_who are to follow them the nonwhites but the whites in power the nonwhites have no rights there is therefore no reason he says for them to rejoice or to participate in the fiftieth anniversary celebration the only thing for the nonwhites to do is to work each and everyone with courage and patience to achieve freedom and democracy for all since he wrote this south_africa has become a republic and is no_longer a member of the british commonwealth but this has not improved relations_between whites and nonwhites nor has it altered lutuli's attitude in any way he gives a most concise expression of the view he has always maintained in a letter to prime_minister striddom6 in which he says we believe in a community where the white and the nonwhite in south_africa can live in harmony and work for our common fatherland sharing equally the good things of life which our country can give us in abundance we believe in the brotherhood of peoples and in respect for the value of the individual my congress has never given expression to hatred for any race in south_africa time and again he has reiterated this right up to the very present his activity has been characterized by a firm and unswerving approach never has he succumbed to the temptation to use violent means in the struggle for his people nothing has shaken him from this firm resolve so firmly rooted is his conviction that violence and terror must not be employed nor has he ever felt or incited hatred of the white man albert_john lutuli's fight has been waged within the borders of his own_country but the issues raised go far_beyond them he brings a message to all who work and strive to establish respect for human_rights both within nations and between nations well might we ask will the nonwhites of south_africa by their suffering their humiliation and their patience show the other nations of the world that human_rights can be won without violence by following a road to which we europeans are committed both intellectually and emotionally but which we have all too often abandoned if the nonwhite people of south_africa ever lift themselves from their humiliation without resorting to violence and terror then it will be above_all because of the work of lutuli their fearless and incorruptible leader who thanks to his own high ethical standards has rallied his people in support of this policy and who throughout his adult life has staked everything and suffered everything without bitterness and without allowing hatred and aggression to replace his abiding love of his fellowmen but if the day should come when the struggle of the nonwhites in south_africa to win their freedom degenerates into bloody slaughter then lutuli's voice will be heard no more but let_us remember him then and never forget that his way was unwavering and clear he would not have had it so let_us all rise in silent and respectful tribute to albert_john lutuli 1 lutuli the road to freedom is via the cross statement made in november 1952 after his dismissal as chief in let my people go p

public gatherings but was not restricted to one area 4 perhaps a reference to the golden city post of johannesburg 5 the rest of this paragraph and the four paragraphs that follow it are ommited in

norwegian_parliament has awarded the peace_prize for 1961 posthumously to dag_hammarskjöld dag_hammarskjöld was born in 1905 and prior to his appointment as secretary_general to the secretariat of the united_nations in 1953 he had been associated with the administration of his native sweden ever_since the completion of his education he had studied widely and his knowledge ranged far_beyond his chosen field his special subject however was regarded as economics in which he took his doctor's degree in 1934 with a thesis entitled konjunkturspridningen 1 he had by then already obtained degrees in philology and in law in 1936 he entered the swedish ministry of finance and from 1941 to 1948 he was chairman of the board of the swedish riksbank in 1945 he became government adviser on trade policy and financial policy and in 1947 joined the swedish foreign office in 1951 he was appointed a consultative cabinet minister but as he himself pointed_out he was committed to no particular party and his cabinet appointment was a professional rather_than a political one in addition to leading various swedish financial delegations in negotiations with other countries primarily in connection with trade agreements he also represented sweden in uniscan2 negotiations and was for a time vice chairman of oeec 3 a brief recapitulation of this kind tells_us little about dag_hammarskjöld the man nor does his well merited reputation as a person of outstanding intellectual ability shed much light on his personality so many men receive this tribute those of us who knew him before he became the secretary_general were also impressed by this young man's wide knowledge and indefatigability as well as by his quiet and unassuming approach to his administrative duties in the service of his country in 1953 he assumed his post as secretary_general in the united_nations secretariat he had already come into contact_with the united_nations as a member and vice chairman of the swedish delegation to the general_assembly in 1951 and as chairman of the delegation in 1952 as secretary_general he succeeded mr trygve lie 4 who had not only built up the united_nations administration and participated in planning its new building but had also given the post of secretary_general a more important and independent position within the united_nations than had probably been originally envisaged in other words he took over an office which had already been given form and an administrative apparatus which had acquired a certain amount of tradition there is no_doubt that in accepting this high office dag_hammarskjöld fully realized that the years ahead would not prove easy he was all too familiar with the difficulties trygve lie had encountered to have any illusions on that score fully aware of the magnitude and complexity of his task he devoted himself to it completely exerting all his determination and strength in carrying it out in a private letter written in 1953 he says to know that the goal is so significant that everything else must be set aside gives a great sense of liberation and makes one indifferent to anything that may happen to oneself it has often been said that from the very first he wished to play the role of adviser rather_than that of politician or we might say that he preferred to be the one carrying_out what others had decided rather_than the one who made the decision as far as i can judge this appraisal is not correct from the beginning back in 1953 when he outlined the role and activities of the secretariat and the secretary_general he laid_down that while it is clearly the duty of the secretariat and of the secretary_general to obtain complete and objective information on the aims and problems of the various member nations the secretary_general must personally form an opinion he must base it on the rules of the un charter and must never for a moment betray those rules even if this means being at variance with members of the un from the very first he placed great importance on the solution of disputes through the medium of private discussion between representatives of the individual countries pursuing what has come to be known as the method of quiet diplomacy there is of course nothing new in this as informal meetings of this kind have always been and will always be an important part of the work necessary to achieve agreement between conflicting views outwardly it may have looked as if he became more and more active as time went on but this i believe can be ascribed more to the course of events than to any change in his views in every situation with which he was faced he had one goal in mind to serve the ideas sponsored by the united_nations he called himself an international civil servant with the emphasis on the word international 5 as such he had only one master and that was the united_nations there can be little doubt that dag_hammarskjöld achieved a great_deal through the informal meetings he took_part in and that in these he demonstrated strong personal initiative yet his personal contribution was best known to the general public in cases where attempts to reach agreement between members in the united_nations had failed or where the instructions he had received were not sufficiently clear and he was compelled personally to point the way as we shall see it is impossible to mention in detail the many areas in which he intervened and on which he left his mark during the time he was secretary_general the first and most_important disputes which fell to his lot to settle arose in the middle_east the first of these was the conflict between israel and the arab_states in 1955 as the representative of the un he succeeded in easing the tension by negotiating an agreement between each of the parties involved and the un setting_up demarcation lines and establishing un observation posts personally he did not believe that the relaxation of tension would prove permanent and he was right in his surmise in the following year in september of 1956 the conflict that arose between great_britain france and egypt after egypt had nationalized the suez canal was submitted to the security_council in october 1956 dag_hammarskjöld tried to find a solution to this dispute through private negotiations conducted by himself and it looked as if these would lead to a satisfactory result but at the end of october 1956 israel attacked egypt and on october 30 the security_council was called together to deal with the situation that had arisen this meeting however proved abortive when france and great_britain exercised their veto right to obstruct a resolution calling on israel to withdraw her troops on the next day october 31 france and great_britain launched their attack on egypt at the meeting of the security_council on october 31 hammarskjöld was the first person to speak in a forthright speech he hinted that he would resign unless all member states honored their pledge to abide by all clauses of the charter on october 31 the general_assembly was then convoked and on november 1 passed a resolution calling on the parties concerned to terminate hostilities immediately and requesting the secretary_general to keep a close watch on the course of events and to report on the way in which the resolution was being implemented in reality the secretary_general was thus vested with far_reaching powers on november 3 hammarskjöld was already able to announce that france and great_britain were willing to suspend hostilities provided that israel and egypt were prepared to accept the establishment of a un force to ensure and supervise the suspension of hostilities and subsequently to prevent the violation of the egyptian israeli border the result was that the war was brought to an end a demarcation line was fixed and a un force was established to guard it he also made a major contribution to the solution of a crisis between lebanon jordan and the arab_states in 1958 in this both the united_states and great_britain were involved during these crises all his qualities were given full scope particularly his ability to negotiate and to act swiftly and firmly and to dag_hammarskjöld must go the principal credit for the fact that all these crises were resolved in the spirit of the united_nations a state of peace was established in this area 6 this was a triumph for the ideal of peace of which the un is an expression and in addition undoubtedly greatly strengthened the position of the secretary_general the concept of peace contained in the un charter was always to remain dag hammarskjöld's guiding principle in tackling such problems as that presented by the liberation of the congo on june 30 1960 there is no time to deal here with all the problems confronting the united_nations in connection with the termination of colonial rule i must restrict myself to the role which the united_nations was to play in the congo when the congo achieved its independence on june 30 1960 it was constituted as a unified state kasavubu7 was elected_president and lumumba8 was made prime_minister lumumba had always supported the idea of a unified congo the new government was faced with a difficult situation the administration which had been in belgian hands had broken down the army had mutinied a large proportion of the white population had fled belgian_troops had intervened in part to protect the white inhabitants and on july 1 the province of katanga declared itself an independent state all these factors the collapse of the administration the mutiny of the armed_forces and finally katanga's secession from the rest of the congo form the background for the request made to the un by kasavubu and lumumba on july 1 for civil assistance and on july 12 for military aid in a cable dispatched on july 13 lumumba emphasized that un military assistance was needed to protect the congo against an attack by belgian_troops hammarskjöld was in a position to grant the congo's request for civil aid without referring the case to the security_council military aid however could be given only by decision of the security_council which he summoned on july 13 this meeting is highly important for it marks a turning point in the history of the un it was the first time that the un used armed force to intervene actively in the solution of a problem involving the termination of colonial rule in the resolution unanimously adopted by the security_council belgium was ordered to withdraw her troops from congo territory and the secretary_general was authorized in consultation with the congo government to provide whatever military aid proved necessary until such time as the country's own forces were in the opinion of the congo government in a position to carry_out their functions the military aid made available to the congo consisted of contingents from african nations and from neutral sweden and ireland no troops from the eastern bloc or from the old colonial powers were included the un force was to function as a noncombatant peace force there was to be no intervention in disputes involving matters of internal policy and arms were to be used only in self defense this form of military aid did not meet the expectations of the congo government which had clearly envisaged the expulsion of belgian_troops by un forces whereas the un's action was taken on the assumption that belgium would comply with the order of the security_council and withdraw her troops from the congo this belgium failed to do despite the fact that a note of july 14 addressed to the congo government announced that belgian_troops would be withdrawn to two bases in katanga as soon as un forces had succeeded in establishing law and order thus during these first few days un intervention had not brought about the result lumumba had anticipated the belgian_troops remained in their bases in katanga and fresh belgian_troops were dispatched to the congo as a consequence during the period from july 14 to july 20 1960 lumumba made some highly unexpected moves first of all as early as july 14 he sent a cable to khrushchev 9 announcing the possibility of asking for russian aid if the western powers continued their aggression against the congo on july 15 he had already received an encouraging reply from khrushchev with that the congo crisis became a factor in the east west conflict rendering the position of hammarskjöld and the un in the congo immensely difficult as the days and months went by their position became no easier all conceivable obstacles to the success of the un's congo venture seemed to pile up disagreement among the congolese themselves on the question of unified state or confederation the support katanga received from belgium soviet aid to lumumba the dissolution of the central government the military rule under mobutu the murder of lumumba increasingly violent russian attacks on hammarskjöld and un action a complete account of all that occurred cannot be given here but an examination of the available documents covering this period will establish that it was the united_nations alone that worked to realize the establishment of the republic of the congo as an independent nation and that the man who above_all others deserves the credit for this is dag_hammarskjöld time and again in the security_council and in the meetings of the general_assembly he fought in defense of his policy and carried the day he insisted throughout that all aid to the congo civil as well as military must be made available through the medium of the un no vested interests representing any of the power blocs must be allowed to exert their influence is it then surprising that he was the object of attack at times from the west but most often and most violently from the soviet_union whose charges took the form of an assault on the very idea of the united_nations organization as a separate power in the calm and dignified answer which dag_hammarskjöld made to the soviet leaders he said that he would remain at his post as long as this was necessary to defend and strengthen the authority of the united_nations and he added it is not soviet russia or any of the great_powers that need the vigilance and protection of the un it is all the others 10 but he was not destined to live long enough to pursue his policy to its conclusion we all know that he perished on his way to a meeting which he hoped would bring an end to the fighting in the congo between katanga troops and un forces which had just broken out during the attempt to implement the un resolution of february 21 1961 this resolution called on un military forces to take immediate steps to prevent a civil war in the congo and to use force only as a last resort the un was furthermore enjoined to ensure that all belgian and other foreign military political and other advisers not under un command should be withdrawn immediately hammarskjöld left for the congo on september 12 at the invitation of the congolese government to discuss the range and details of the un's program of aid to the congo when dag_hammarskjöld left new_york he knew that the situation in katanga was difficult but it was not until he received dr linner's report on september 14 that he learned that katanga forces and un troops were fighting one another 11 attempts to conclude a truce during the first few days of his visit proved unsuccessful so dag_hammarskjöld decided to establish personal contact_with the president of katanga tshombe 12 his purpose as he explained in a message to tshombe was to find the means of settling the immediate conflict in a peaceful manner and thus open the way to a solution of the katanga problem within the framework of the congolese state the meeting never took_place dag hammarskjöld's plane crashed on september 18 on its way to tshombe he and all the others aboard perished then and not till then criticism of hammarskjöld and un policy in the congo was silenced but during the period from september 13 to 18 operations in the province of katanga were severely criticized this time in western quarters with the strongest assault coming from certain english conservative newspapers dag_hammarskjöld was exposed to criticism and violent unrestrained attacks but he never departed from the path he had chosen from the very first the path that was to result in the un's developing into an effective and constructive international organization capable of giving life to the principles and aims expressed in the un charter administered by a strong secretariat served by men who both felt and acted internationally the goal he always strove to attain was to make the un charter the one by which all countries regulated themselves today this goal may seem remote as we know it is remote dag_hammarskjöld fully realized this and in a speech in chicago in 1960 he said working at the edge of the development of human society is to work on the brink of the unknown much of what is done will one day prove to have been of little avail that is no excuse for the failure to act in accordance_with our best understanding in recognition of its limits but with faith in the ultimate result of the creative evolution in which it is our privilege to cooperate 13 his driving_force was his belief that goodwill among men and nations would one day create conditions in which peace would prevail in the world the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament has today awarded him the peace_prize for 1961 posthumously in gratitude for all he did for what he achieved for what he fought for to create peace and goodwill among nations and men let_us stand in tribute to

of the new buildings of the university of chicago law school may 1 1960 shortly after the atomic bombs were exploded over hiroshima and nagasaki1 albert_einstein made this statement the time has come now when man must give up war it is no_longer rational to solve international problems by resorting to war now that an atomic bomb such as the bombs exploded at hiroshima and nagasaki can destroy a city kill all the people in a city a small city the size of minneapolis say we can see that we must now make use of man's powers of reason in order to settle disputes between nations in accordance_with the principles of justice we must develop international_law strengthen the united_nations and have peace in the world from now on at the time few people heeded these words of albert_einstein one man however never forgot them the man we welcome among us today the man whom the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament has selected for this_year's award of the peace_prize linus carl pauling who ever_since 1946 has campaigned ceaselessly not only against nuclear_weapons tests not only against the spread of these armaments not only against their very use but against all warfare as a means of solving international conflicts linus_pauling is a professor of chemistry for thirty nine years he has been on the staff of the california institute of technology in pasadena where he was made a professor in 1931 in addition to the nobel prize in chemistry his scientific achievements have won him many distinctions medals and honors both in his own_country and abroad his renown as a scientist is beyond dispute in 1946 at the request of albert_einstein linus_pauling together with seven other scientists formed the emergency committee of atomic scientists of which einstein was chairman 1 the most_important task of this committee was to bring to the notice of people everywhere the tremendous change that had taken_place in the world after the splitting of the atom and the production of the atomic bomb had become fact in the words of the author robert jungk it was a crusade undertaken by men who were children in political affairs 2 the hope cherished by mankind that once the second_world war was over an age of peace and disarmament would follow was not fulfilled it was not long before differences between east and west emerged in all their stark reality as the cooperation engendered in time of war crumbled and was replaced by suspicion and mutual fear of aggression the result was the armaments race between the two great_powers to see who could produce the most effective nuclear_weapons gradually the terror balance became the tacitly accepted safeguard against war and a guarantee of peace it was in august 1949 that the soviet_union also succeeded in producing the atom_bomb 3 the armaments race created an atmosphere which not only made it difficult to work for the promotion of disarmament and peace but also threatened to muzzle freedom of speech inevitably the crusade lost impetus and faded away but linus_pauling marched on for him retreat was impossible during the first few years his aim was above_all to prevent the hydrogen bomb from becoming a reality in speeches and lectures he endeavored to open the eyes of his fellowmen to the catastrophe it represented this bomb he declared may have a destructive effect a hundred a thousand nay ten thousand times greater than that of the bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki its effect will depend on how great the bomb is and at what height above the earth it is exploded this statement was made as early as 1947 and subsequent tests with the hydrogen bomb proved the validity of his predictions on february 13 1950 pauling spoke to a large audience in carnegie hall in new_york this time in protest_against the decision to produce the hydrogen bomb his speech was subsequently published as a brochure entitled the ultimate decision he opened his speech by describing the consequences should there be a major war involving hydrogen bombs a thousand million men and women dead and the earth's atmosphere permeated with toxic radioactive substances from which no human being animal or plant would be safe he concludes as follows the solution of the world's problem the problem of atomic war is that we must we must bring law and order into the world as a whole our political leaders impelled by the massed feelings of the people of the world must learn that peace is the important goal a peace that reflects the spirit of true humanity the spirit of the brotherhood of man it is not necessary that the social and economic systems in russia be identical with that in the united_states in order that these two great nations can be at peace with one another it is only necessary that the people of the united_states and the people of russia have respect for one another a deep desire to work for progress a mutual recognition that war has finally ruled itself out as the arbiter of the destiny of humanity once the people of the world express these feelings the east and the west can reach a reasonable and equitable decision about all world affairs and can march together side by side towards a more and more glorious future this 1950 speech was followed by a series of talks and lectures on the same subject what would happen if a major nuclear war_broke out there were many of course who recognized the truth of linus pauling's warning but at that time his words aroused no general response from the american public outside the ranks of scientists and peace organizations he was then relatively unknown and the people themselves in the united_states as here in norway at a later period they found it most convenient to turn a deaf ear to his warnings the united_states tested its first hydrogen bomb in november 1952 and the soviet_union followed suit in august 1953 the cold_war had now entered upon a still more uncompromising phase but the voice of linus_pauling was not to be silenced tireless and undaunted and supported in his views by numerous scientists he continued to draw_attention to the fearful destruction and mass annihilation of human life that might result if hydrogen bombs were used there does_not seem he says to be any theoretical limit to the size of these weapons of the appeals launched at this time bearing pauling's signature the mainau declaration of july 15 1955 is the best known it was signed by fifty two nobel prizewinners most of them scientists the appeal is such an important document that i should like to quote it we the undersigned are scientists of different countries different creeds different political persuasions outwardly we are bound together only by the nobel prize which we have been favored to receive with pleasure we have devoted our lives to the service of science it is we believe a path to a happier life for people we see with horror that this very science is giving mankind the means to destroy itself by total military use of weapons feasible today the earth can be contaminated with radioactivity to such an extent that whole peoples can be annihilated neutrals may die thus as well as belligerents if war_broke out among the great_powers who could guarantee that it would not develop into a deadly conflict a nation that engages in a total war thus signals its own destruction and imperils the whole world we do not deny that perhaps peace is being preserved precisely by the fear of these weapons nevertheless we think it is a delusion if governments believe that they can avoid war for a long time through the fear of these weapons fear and tension have often engendered wars similarly it seems to us a delusion to believe that small conflicts could in the future always be decided by traditional weapons in extreme danger no nation will deny itself the use of any weapon that scientific technology can produce all nations must come to the decision to renounce force as a final resort if they are not prepared to do this they will cease to exist in the harsh political atmosphere then prevailing it was not surprising that linus_pauling gradually became isolated and ostracized primarily on suspicion of being a communist on several occasions during the 1950s the authorities withheld his passport even when he wished to travel abroad to attend conferences of a purely scientific nature as for example in 1952 it is only fair to record that upon making his application direct to washington he was granted his passport in 1955 dr pauling appeared before a committee of the united_states senate that was investigating the work of the passport office he was then questioned on his alleged associations with communists or communist sympathizers a term which at that time was applied to many people when asked whether he himself was a communist linus_pauling repeated what he had so often declared under oath that he was not a communist that he had not been a communist that he was not a crypto communist nor a theoretical marxist that he had never wittingly helped the communist_party or followed the party line the senator conducting the investigation remarked that it was his own impression that it was the communists who had followed pauling's line this was as far as the committee could get and for a few years pauling was left in peace anyone familiar with linus_pauling and his views anyone who has heard him speak or has read his works should know that he is by no means a communist meanwhile as the united_states great_britain and the soviet_union stepped up their nuclear_tests radioactive_fallout in the earth's atmosphere increased soon more and more scientists alive to the dangerous effects of radioactive_fallout on human health and hereditary factors were protesting against these tests linus_pauling was one of the first to perceive the danger and from the middle of the 1950s he devoted the better part of his time and energy to his campaign against test explosions he constantly maintained that these tests must be terminated by an agreement signed by the countries possessing the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb and that the agreement must be enforced by means of effective international supervision it was during his struggle to end tests of nuclear_weapons that linus pauling's name became well_known all over the world and also controversial in order to assess in terms of figures the effect radioactive_fallout would have on future generations linus_pauling carried_out his own investigations and calculations calculations which he always submits with reservation because of the many unknown factors involved time and again he states maybe my figures are many times too high maybe they are many times too low but his calculations were supported by many others i need only remind you of albert schweitzer's message broadcast by the oslo radio station on april 23 1957 the opposition pauling encountered came first of all from two scientists e teller3 and w.f libby of the u.s atomic energy commission they seem to differ not so much on the resultant calculations themselves as on the conclusion to be drawn from these calculations teller and libby readily admit that radioactive_fallout is harmful but they consider this fact relative weighing it against the risk taken by being unable to secure ever more effective defensive armaments through nuclear_tests pauling's views on test explosions on the other_hand are not dependent on whether there are few or many people who would suffer from radioactive_fallout on may 15 1957 in a speech to students at washington university in st louis he dealt with what was known about the effect of radioactivity on human hereditary factors among other_things he said i believe that no human being should be sacrificed to a project and in particular i believe that no human being should be sacrificed to the project of perfecting nuclear_weapons that could kill hundreds of millions of human_beings could devastate this beautiful world in which we live it was after this speech that he drew up the appeal which more_than anything else attracted the attention of the public this appeal was signed by more_than 2,000 american scientists and was later circulated and signed by over 8,000 foreign scientists from forty nine different countries in his book no more war published in 1958 linus_pauling has described how he collected these signatures the petition was the result of the efforts of individual scientists no organization was responsible for circulating the petition or gathering signatures the whole job was done by a mere handful of people in january 1958 linus_pauling and his wife ava helen pauling submitted the appeal with its 11,021 signatures to the secretary_general of the united_nations organization dag_hammarskjöld the pauling appeal reads as follows we the scientists whose names are signed below urge that an international agreement to stop the testing of nuclear bombs be made now each nuclear bomb test spreads an added burden of radioactive elements over every part of the world each added amount of radiation causes damage to the health of human_beings all over the world and causes damage to the pool of human germ plasma such as to lead to an increase in the number of seriously defective children that will be born in future generations so long as these weapons are in the hands of only three powers an agreement for their control is feasible if testing continues and the possession of these weapons spreads to additional governments the danger of outbreak of a cataclysmic nuclear war through the reckless action of some irresponsible national leader will be greatly increased an international agreement to stop the testing of nuclear bombs now could serve as a first step toward a more general disarmament and the ultimate effective abolition of nuclear_weapons averting the possibility of a nuclear war that would be a catastrophe to all humanity we have in common with our fellowmen a deep concern for the welfare of all human_beings as scientists we have knowledge of the dangers involved and therefore a special responsibility to make those dangers known we deem it imperative that immediate action be taken to effect an international agreement to stop the testing of all nuclear_weapons and then in 1958 without entering into any prior agreement the soviet_union followed by the united_states and great_britain discontinued nuclear_tests just what effect the warnings of scientists foremost among them linus_pauling and albert_schweitzer may have had in this connection would be difficult to say with any certainty but there is no_doubt that both of them together with other scientists have contributed to familiarizing people with the dangers nuclear_tests involve and every government is bound to take into consideration public_opinion whether openly expressed or not pauling's campaign had aroused a tremendous amount of attention both at home and abroad once_again the internal security subcommittee of the united_states senate summoned him for interrogation the first interview took_place on june 21 1960 and the second on october 11 of the same year at pauling's request the hearings were held in public and the proceedings published for everyone to read the primary purpose of the subcommittee was to discover how the 11,000 signatures had been obtained there were many who believed that the appeal was communist inspired and once_again linus_pauling found himself facing the old charge of communism pauling answered every question frankly and clearly questioned on his own attitude to communism he said at a meeting in pasadena i testified under oath that a statement that i had prepared to the effect that i was not a communist never had been a communist and never had been associated with the communist_party was true later on in the course of the proceedings he stated i would like to know more about marxism than i know i believe that we never can know too much about anything i do not understand dialectical materialism either but i do not believe in censorship i believe in freedom of publication he gave the subcommittee all the facts on how the appeal signed by the 11,021 scientists came about but when the subcommittee asked to be supplied with a list of names of those_who had assisted him in collecting signatures he replied i think that my reputation and example may well have led many young people to work for peace in this way my conscience does_not allow me to protect myself by sacrificing these idealistic and hopeful people and i_am not going to do it for he continued later anyone called before this committee is rendered vulnerable he may lose his job it was a serious matter for linus_pauling to refuse to answer questions put to him by the subcommittee and he realized that he risked a prison sentence for contempt of congress pauling endeavored to secure a court ruling that the subcommittee's demand that he submit the names of those_who had helped him to collect signatures violated the constitutional right of every citizen to appeal to the authorities pauling failed to secure a favorable verdict in two instances his appeal to the supreme court did not materialize for the senate subcommittee dropped the matter it merely published its findings in a report which incidentally was strongly criticized in some of the major american newspapers as being too one sided and not particularly fair to pauling although encountering opposition in various quarters pauling's name and his views became even better known and the manner in which his hearings had been conducted gained him added support as is so often the case when a good cause is attacked undaunted linus_pauling and his wife ava helen pauling continued their campaign delivering as many as a hundred speeches and lectures a year his wife has been a great source of inspiration for pauling and the assistance she renders him is invaluable her own peace lectures with their special appeal to women have been influential it is impossible in a short address to touch upon all the speeches linus_pauling has made and all the conferences in which he has participated i must confine myself to a few of the international disarmament and peace conferences such as the conference against atomic and hydrogen bombs held in hiroshima in 1959 where he personally wrote the resolution which was issued after the meeting this states that an international agreement must be reached in which the nations pledge themselves to terminate all tests with nuclear_weapons and not to produce new ones nor should these weapons be distributed to other nations a neutral zone should be established between east and west among the countries to remain neutral mention is made of east and west germany with adjoining countries and japan but naturally not china in may 1961 linus_pauling and his wife convened in oslo an international conference against the spread of nuclear_weapons scientists from fifteen countries attended and the main point in the resolution adopted was that nuclear_weapons must not be allowed to spread to other countries since such a spread would inevitably increase the danger of some power's willfully unleashing nuclear warfare furthermore the spread of these weapons would also reduce the chance of a disarmament agreement on september 1 1961 the soviet_union resumed nuclear testing in the atmosphere and announced plans for detonating a fifty megaton nuclear bomb on october 18 pauling sent a telegram to premier khrushchev4 earnestly entreating him not to carry_out this plan at the same_time he sent a telegram to president kennedy5 requesting that the united_states government declare that no test explosions would be undertaken in the atmosphere provided the soviet_union revoked its plan to detonate the fifty megaton bomb he received a long letter from khrushchev dated october 26 1961 the gist of which was that the soviet_union considered itself regrettably forced to carry_out new tests with nuclear_weapons and he was therefore sorry that he was unable to reverse the decision already made the reasons given were that the western powers were arming and that the soviet_union considered its security threatened and so despite his efforts linus_pauling did not succeed at this time he was also deeply involved in the problem of shelters in the event of nuclear attack he maintained that shelters would not be able to reduce the number of dead and wounded in a nuclear war because their construction might give people the false impression that nuclear warfare was not after all so dangerous he strove in articles and speeches to enlighten the general public on this point in november 1961 pauling and his wife were invited by the academy of science in moscow to attend its second centenary celebration while they were there they were both asked to lecture on disarmament and peace pauling's lecture was based_on the same arguments he had used in the united_states but he emphasized the danger of the new nuclear_tests in the soviet_union he was confronted with the argument that the soviet_union was compelled to continue its tests in order to be in a position to obtain weapons capable of preventing the outbreak of a nuclear war pauling pointed_out that this was the very argument used by those in the united_states who insisted on continuing nuclear_tests during this visit in moscow pauling applied for a personal interview with premier khrushchev when this was refused he sent the russian leader two letters and a draft of an agreement for a ban on nuclear_tests in the main his proposal tallies with the test_ban agreement of july 25 1963 on march 1 1962 the united_states resumed nuclear_tests in the atmosphere in october 1962 pauling was in a position to state that the tests undertaken in the soviet_union and in the united_states during the course of the previous year or so had released twice as much radioactive_fallout as all the tests undertaken during the sixteen preceding years in 1963 however after what had long appeared a state of permanent deadlock discussions on a nuclear test_ban finally made some headway when the united_states the soviet_union and great_britain entered_into an agreement this was signed in moscow on july 25 1963 and went into effect on october 10 of this year most countries have now signed the most_important exceptions being france and china the agreement covers all tests of nuclear_weapons except those carried_out underground in his magnificent speech to the american people on july 26 of this year the late president john f kennedy stated even then the number of children and grandchildren with cancer in their bones with leukemia in their blood or with poison in their lungs might seem statistically small to some in comparison with natural health hazards but this is not a natural health hazard and it is not a statistical issue the loss of even one human life or the malformation of even one baby who may be born long after we are gone should be of concern to us all in his speech president kennedy revealed that his views on nuclear_tests were based_on the same moral attitude that linus_pauling has consistently maintained no one would suggest that linus_pauling is actually responsible for the nuclear test_ban itself or for the efforts of the great_powers to arrive_at an agreement acceptable to all parties but does anyone believe that this treaty would have been concluded now if there had been no responsible scientist who tirelessly unflinchingly year in year out had impressed on the authorities and on the general public the real menace of nuclear_tests in his speech president kennedy likewise stressed the great danger of spreading nuclear_weapons to more and more countries these were his words i ask you to stop and think for a moment what it would mean to have nuclear_weapons in so many hands in the hands of countries large and small stable and unstable responsible and irresponsible scattered throughout the world there would be no rest for anyone then no stability no real security and no chance of effective disarmament even_though the test_ban treaty has been effected this is only the first small step toward an agreement on complete disarmament and peace though the road may be long and difficult linus_pauling has an unshakable belief that one day mankind will succeed in banning war i believe that there is a greater power in the world than the evil power of military force of nuclear bombs there is the power of good of morality of humanitarianism in his opinion it will be possible by enlisting these forces to build a world community in which the actions of all nations will be subject to just supervision and control through the medium of international_law and justice as far as i know linus_pauling has not drawn_up any concrete plan for the future but one thing is certain he has great faith in the role of science as he shows in his suggestion for establishing a world peace research organization which would be affiliated with the united_nations and which would represent every branch of science including the natural sciences and the humanities an organization of this kind must be based_on knowledge and wisdom it is for this reason that pauling has now left his position at the california institute of technology in pasadena and joined the center for the study of democratic institutions at santa barbara he has taken this step he tells_us because this institution allows him greater freedom to continue his work for peace he wants to use this opportunity for research in drawing up concrete plans for the future it is linus pauling's highly ethical attitude toward life the deepest driving_force within him that drew him into the fight_against nuclear_weapons through his campaign linus_pauling has manifested the ethical responsibility which he believes science should bear for the fate of mankind today and in the future the scientist's urge to wrest nature's secrets from her is one linus_pauling can never satisfy as long as the world exists there will always be bold adventurous minds and new campaigns to be carried on for new goals should linus_pauling through his tireless efforts have contributed if only a little to restoring to science its ideals then his campaign will in itself have been of such value that we living today can scarcely appreciate the full extent of the debt we owe him 1 early in august 1945 in the last days of wwii 2 the seven other scientists were hans a bethe selig hecht thorfin r hogness

divide the peace_prize for 1963 between the two sister organizations of the red_cross the international red_cross committee and the league of red_cross societies it is most appropriate that such a decision should be taken this year for it marks the centennial of the red_cross that it should have been possible to constitute the red_cross and start its work in 1863 is one of the great miracles in human history it was after the french sardinian austrian war and on the background of the terrible massacres on the battlefields of northern italy that the red_cross came into existence on june 24 1859 300,000 french sardinian and austrian soldiers fought at solferino in northern italy the most merciless battle of the war and more_than 40,000 dying dead and wounded were herded into the little village of castiglione there was no organized medical aid and no medical supplies and there was no water the heat was suffocating and in this hell on earth an idealistic and pious young swiss businessman from geneva henri_dunant he was later called by dickens the man in white and repeated the words which dunant adopted tutti fratelli we are all brothers worked day and night among the dead and the dying and pressed into his service every man and woman of the neighorhood the italian peasant women came to his aid and helped even the enemies dunant had come to italy for a conference with napoleon1 but followed the call of his heart and conscience the earlier decades of the nineteenth century had seen wars in every country of europe and from the days of the disasters of the great french armies the minds of statesmen and soldiers were busy with the idea of how to prevent wars and how to fight the disorder and disorganization which followed in the wake of war fifty_years before solferino general dobeln the great hero of the swedish war in finland 2 wrote in his diary happy the country where nothing is regarded as little things neither in peace nor in war dunant saw in castiglione the indescribable suffering that came as a result of the lack of preparation and the neglect of what had been regarded as little things and when later the idea of the red_cross was accepted with open hearts in england it was because the importance of the little things had been understood as a result of florence nightingale's work 3 and there were public meetings very much like those that were later arranged for the red_cross for such a meeting in 1845 a young english authoress miss craigie presented a poem called little things 4 which became very popular and was recited in the schools of england and america and accepted as an introduction to work for the red_cross little drops of water little grains of sand make the mighty ocean and the pleasant land thus the little minutes humble though they be make the mighty ages of eternity thus our little errors make a mighty sin drop by drop the evil floods the heart within little deeds of kindness little words of love make our earth an eden like the heaven above never have little things given greater results last summer there were red_cross societies in eighty eight countries with a membership of nearly 170 million henri_dunant had learnt to see the importance of little things and when in 1862 he published his book un souvenir de solferino which was a tremendous shock to public_opinion in europe he launched the idea to start before any war_broke out organizations of peaceful idealistic women and men to work for help to the wounded in war friends and enemies alike and should it not be possible to bring_about an international convention to declare that wounded and medical personnel should be regarded as neutral and under protection of the governments at war his book made an impression like that of uncle tom's cabin by harriet beecher stowe 5 and stirred the conscience of responsible people all over europe in his native city of geneva la societe genevoise d'utilite publique the geneva public welfare society appointed a committee of five among whom was dunant to make his idea a reality and these five private individuals without any official status really succeeded in arranging a conference at geneva in october 1863 in which sixteen countries participated among them norway and sweden here the red_cross was organized and in honor of dunant it adopted as its international emblem the inverted swiss flag the red_cross on white until then every country if it had any organized military medical service at all had had its own flag and symbols and there was general confusion behind the battlefields in 1864 the year after delegates of twelve states invited by the swiss government on the initiative of the committee of five met at geneva and adopted the first geneva_convention for protection of sick and wounded in land warfare gradually and in the early years slowly the red_cross became the mighty institution which it is today it is wholly independent of any government and completely neutral its highest authority is the red_cross conference which usually meets every four years and consists of delegates from the national red_cross societies the international red_cross committee the league of red_cross societies and representatives of the governments which have signed the geneva_convention the delegation of each national red_cross has only one vote the decisions of the conference bind the national red_cross societies morally but the conference can only give advice and express wishes the first international red_cross conference was in paris in 1867 and the most recent one was in new delhi in 1957 on the invitation of the indian red_cross a permanent international red_cross commission of nine members has been established to discuss every problem which arises between the conferences and to decide when and where the next conference shall meet five of the nine are elected by the conference from the national red_cross organizations two are appointed by the committee and two by the league the work of the international committee has two branches the general affairs division and the executive division the general affairs division has worked to spread knowledge of the geneva conventions and the principles of the red_cross a work which has been of particular importance in all the new states at the same_time the committee has tried to make governments improve and extend the geneva_convention which did not correspond to the modern form of war and four new conventions were adopted at a conference in 1949 for the protection of the victims of sea warfare for the shipwrecked for prisoners of war and for the protection of nonmilitary persons in time of war but governments proved most reluctant to accept any conventions that would forbid atomic warfare and use of weapons whose destruction cannot be controlled by those_who make use of them the red_cross conference at new delhi again adopted such resolutions and they were sent to the governments of all countries with the remarks of the international committee most governments have given no answer and mr boissier has commented that it is not difficult to understand this silence it will be necessary to fight fear and hatred and in this work is the future of the red_cross in many quarters there has been an idea that the committee as a swiss body is more completely neutral and impartial than the league it was the committee that was asked to take care of all transportation and distribution of aid in hungary after the uprising of the people 6 but it was the league that took care of the refugees at a cost of more_than 100 million swiss francs and corresponding large sums of money were given to the algerian refugees7 and to the congo8 and it was a delegate of the committee who was killed at katanga it was the committee that was permitted by the government of nepal to give aid to the refugees from tibet9 for switzerland not being a member of the united_nations had taken no part in any decision against communist china in the same way it was on the invitation of the japanese red_cross that the committee repatriated north korean prisoners of war in japan up to 1962 some 75,000 had been brought back to their home country and in europe the committee has been active in repatriating refugees in even greater numbers and bringing together families that had been dispersed and the committee under the peace treaty with japan has distributed the compensation given to those_who had been prisoners of war in japan and in europe to the victims of medical experiments in germany the work of the committee is so closely coordinated with that of the league that to all practical purposes they form a unity and in many fields they work hand in hand with the united_nations the great worldwide humanitarian work of the league falls outside the sphere of the peace_prize but the cooperation between the red_cross societies of ninety different countries of different races creeds and color is of very real importance for international understanding and peace in mohammedan countries the red_cross became the red half moon on white in iran the red lion and sun but they all work loyally together and the successful efforts of the red_cross societies in china and japan which led to the repatriation of 30,000 japanese prisoners in china in 1952 promoted peace in the far east and corresponding efforts which led to an exchange of prisoners between poland and west germany in 1955 had real importance particular stress has been laid on the work of the junior red_cross societies the red_cross youth movement started in the u.s in 1923 and has been in constant evolution today there are some sixty two million members and it cannot be doubted that if millions of young women and men are taught in the schools that we are all brothers tutti fratelli and that little deeds of friendship and little words of love should bind the world together the ideas of nobel will

domination was put down by russian troops early in november 7 the algerian refugee_problem arose as a result of algerian revolt against france the ensuing war between france and algeria and finally of civil strife once independence had been agreed upon in the early 1960s 8 the new independent republic of the congo created in 1960 was immediately torn by regional and tribal rivalries with the province of katanga seceding but eventually being subdued by un troops and reintegrated with the republic 9 many tibetans became refugees as a result of unrest after the chinese communists assumed dominance over tibet in the early 1950s and of the failure of a full scale tibetan revolt in 1959 not many years have passed since the name martin_luther king became known all over the world nine years_ago as leader of the negro people in montgomery in the state of alabama he launched a campaign to secure for negroes the right to use public transport on an equal footing with whites but it was not because he led a racial minority in their struggle for equality that martin_luther king achieved fame many others have done the same and their names have been forgotten luther king's name will endure for the way in which he has waged his struggle personifying in his conduct the words that were spoken to mankind whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also 1 fifty thousand negroes obeyed this commandment in december 1955 and won a victory this was the beginning at that time martin_luther king was only twenty six years old he was a young man but nevertheless a mature one his father is a clergyman who made his way in life unaided and provided his children with a good home where he tried to shield them from the humiliations of racial_discrimination both as a member of the national association for the advancement of colored people and as a private citizen he has been active in the struggle for civil rights and his children have followed in his footsteps as a boy martin_luther king soon learned the role played by economic inequality in the life of the individual and of the community from his childhood years this left its indelible mark on him but there is no evidence to suggest that as a boy he had yet made up his mind to devote his life to the struggle for negro rights he spent his student years in the northern states where the laws provided no sanction for the discrimination he had encountered in the south but where nevertheless black and white did not mix in their daily lives yet living in the northern states especially in a university milieu was like a breath of fresh air at boston university where he took a doctor's degree in philosophy he met coretta scott who was studying singing she was from his own state of alabama a member of the black middle class which also exists in the south the young couple after being married were faced with a choice should they remain in the north where life offered greater security and better conditions or return to the south they elected to go back to the south where martin_luther king was installed as minister of a baptist congregation in montgomery here he lived in a society where a sharp barrier existed between negroes and whites worse still the black community in montgomery was itself divided its leaders at loggerheads and the rank and file paralyzed by the passivity of its educated members as a result of their apathy few of them were engaged in the work of improving the status of the negro the great majority were indifferent those_who had something to lose were afraid of forfeiting the little they had achieved nor as martin_luther king discovered did all the negro clergy care about the social problems of their community many of them were of the opinion that ministers of religion had no business getting involved in secular movements aimed_at improving people's social and economic conditions their task was to preach the gospel and keep men's minds centered on the heavenly early in 1955 an attempt was made to unite the various groups of blacks the attempt failed martin_luther king said that the tragic division in the negro community could be cured only by some divine miracle the picture he gives us of conditions in montgomery is not an inspiring one even as late as 1954 the negroes accepted the existing status as a fact and hardly anyone opposed the system actively montgomery was a peaceful town but beneath the surface discontent smoldered some of the black clergy in their sermons as well as in their personal attitude championed the cause of negro equality and this had given many fresh confidence and courage then came the bus boycott of december 5 1955 it looks almost as if the boycott was the result of a mere coincidence the immediate cause was the arrest of mrs rosa parks for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white man she was in the section reserved for negroes and was occupying one of the seats just behind the section set aside for whites which was filled the arrest of mrs parks not only aroused great resentment but provoked direct action and it was because of this that martin_luther king was to become the central personality in the negro's struggle for human_rights in his book stride toward freedom he has described not only the actual bus conflict but also how on december 5 after the boycott had been started he was elected chairman of the organization formed to conduct the struggle 2 he tells_us that the election came as a surprise to him had he been given time to think things over he would probably have said no he had supported the boycott when asked to do so on december 4 but he was beginning to doubt whether it was morally right according to christian teaching to start a boycott then he remembered david thoreau's essay on civil disobedience which he had read in his earlier years and which had made a profound impression on him a sentence by thoreau3 came back to him we can no_longer lend our cooperation to an evil system but he was not convinced that the boycott would be carried_out as late as the evening of sunday december 4 he believed that if sixty percent of the negroes cooperated it would prove reasonably successful during the morning of december 5 as bus after bus without a single negro passenger passed his window he realized that the boycott had proved a hundred percent effective but final victory had not yet been won and as yet no one had announced that the campaign was to be conducted in accordance_with the slogan thou shalt not requite violence with violence this message was given to his people by martin_luther king in the speech he made to thousands of them on the evening of december 5 1955 he calls this speech4 the most decisive he ever made here are his own words we have sometimes given our white brothers the feeling that we liked the way we were being treated but we come here tonight to be saved from that patience that makes us patient with anything less_than freedom and justice but he continues our method will be that of persuasion not coercion we will only say to the people let your conscience be your guide our actions must be guided by the deepest principles of our christian faith once_again we must hear the words of jesus5 echoing across the centuries love your enemies bless them that curse you and pray for them that despitefully use you he concludes as follows if you will protest courageously and yet with dignity and christian love when the history books are written in future generations the historians will have to pause and say there lived a great people a black people who injected new meaning and dignity into the veins of civilization this is our challenge and our overwhelming responsibility this battle cry for such it was was enthusiastically received by the audience this was montgomery's moment in history as martin_luther king calls it his words rallied the majority of negroes during their active struggle for human_rights all around the south inspired by this slogan they declared war on the discrimination between black and white in eating places shops schools public parks and playgrounds how was it possible to obtain such strong support to answer this question we must recall the strong position enjoyed by the clergy among the negroes the church is their only sanctuary in their leisure hours here they can rise above the troubles and cares of everyday life nor would the appeal that they go into battle unarmed have been followed had not the blacks themselves been so profoundly religious despite laws passed by congress and judgments given by the american supreme court this struggle has not proved successful everywhere since these laws and judgments have been sabotaged as anyone who has followed the course of events subsequent to 1955 knows despite sabotage and imprisonment the negroes have continued their unarmed struggle only rarely have they acted against the principle given to them by requiting violence with violence even_though for many of us this would have been the immediate reaction what can we say of the young students who sat down in an eating place reserved for whites they were not served but they remained seated white teenagers mocked and insulted them and stubbed their lighted cigarettes out on their necks the black students sat unmoving they possessed the strength that only belief can give the belief that they fight in a just cause and that their struggle will lead to victory precisely because they wage it with peaceful_means martin_luther king's belief is rooted first and foremost in the teaching of christ but no one can really understand him unless aware that he has been influenced also by the great thinkers of the past and the present he has been inspired above_all by mahatma gandhi6 whose example convinced him that it is possible to achieve victory in an unarmed struggle before he had read about gandhi he had almost concluded that the teaching of jesus could only be put into_practice as between individuals but after making a study of gandhi he realized that he had been mistaken gandhi he says was probably the first person in history to lift the love ethic of jesus above mere interaction between individuals to a powerful and effective social force in gandhi's teaching he found the answer to a question that had long troubled him how does one set about carrying_out a social reform i found he tells_us in the nonviolent resistance philosophy of gandhi the only morally and practically sound method open to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom martin_luther king has been attacked from many quarters greatest was the resistance he encountered from white fanatics moderate whites and even the more prosperous members of his own race consider he is proceeding too fast that he should wait and let time work for him to weaken the opposition in an open_letter in the press eight clergymen reproached him for this and other aspects of his campaign martin_luther king answered these charges in a letter written in birmingham jail in the spring of 1963 i should like to quote a few lines actually time itself is neutral human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co workers with god and without this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation 7 in answer to the charge that he has failed to negotiate he replies you are quite right in calling for negotiation indeed this is the very purpose of direct action nonviolent direct action seeks to foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue he reminds them that the negroes have not won a single victory for civil rights without struggling persistently to achieve it in a lawful way without recourse to violence when reproached for breaking the laws in the course of his struggle he replies as follows there are two types of laws just and unjust an unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law an unjust law is a code that a numerical or powerful majority group compels a minority group to obey but does_not make binding on itself one who breaks an unjust law must do so openly lovingly and with a willingness to accept the penalty martin_luther king also takes the church to task even during the bus conflict in montgomery he had expected that white clergy and rabbis would prove the negroes staunchest allies but he was bitterly disappointed all too many others he recalls have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained glass windows it is not difficult to understand martin_luther king's disappointment with the white church for what is the first commandment of christian teaching if not thou shalt love thy neighbor yet even if victory is won in the fight_against segregation discrimination will still persist in the economic field and in social intercourse realistic as he is martin_luther king knows this in his book strength to love he writes the court orders and federal enforcement agencies are of inestimable value in achieving desegregation but desegregation is only a partial though necessary step towards the final goal which we seek to realize genuine intergroup and interpersonal living but something must touch the hearts and souls of men so that they will come together spiritually because it is natural and right true integration will be achieved by true neighbors who are willingly obedient to unenforceable obligations martin_luther king's unarmed struggle has been waged in his own_country its result has been that an obdurate centuries old and traditional conflict is now nearing its solution is it possible that the road he and his people have charted may bring a ray of hope to other parts of the world a hope that conflicts between races nations and political systems can be solved not by fire and sword but in a spirit of true brotherly_love can the words of our poet arnulf overland8 come true the unarmed only can draw on sources eternal the spirit alone gives victory it sounds like a dream of a remote and unknown future but life is not worth living without a dream and without working to make the dream reality today now that mankind is in possession of the atom_bomb the time has come to lay our weapons and armaments aside and listen to the message martin_luther king has given us through the unarmed struggle he has waged on_behalf of his race luther_king looks also beyond the frontiers of his own_country he says more_than ever before my friends men of all races and nations are today challenged to be neighborly no_longer can we afford the luxury of passing by on the other side such folly was once called moral failure today it will lead to universal suicide if we assume that mankind has a right to survive then we must find an alternative to war and destruction in our days of space vehicles and guided ballistic missiles the choice is either nonviolence or nonexistence though martin_luther king has not personally committed himself to the international conflict his own struggle is a clarion call to all who work for peace he is the first person in the western world to have shown us that a struggle can be waged without violence he is the first to make the message of brotherly_love a reality in the course of his struggle and he has brought this message to all men to all nations and races today we pay_tribute to martin_luther king the man who has never abandoned his faith in the unarmed struggle he is waging who has suffered for his faith who has been imprisoned on many occasions whose home has been subject to bomb attacks whose life and the lives of his family have been threatened and who nevertheless has never faltered to this undaunted champion of peace the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament has awarded the peace_prize for the year 1964 from nobel lectures peace 1951 1970 editor frederick w haberman elsevier publishing company amsterdam 1972 the death of alfred_nobel at san remo on december_10 1896 robbed the world of a highly talented person at the same_time the world was enriched by a document a testament which has provided growth and stimulus to the ideals and the compelling desire for research that provided the guiding star in alfred_nobel's rich but lonely life in his will nobel directed that the interest on his fortune should be divided among those persons who have rendered the greatest services to mankind on the subject of the peace_prize he categorically states that it is to be awarded to the person who has done most to promote brotherhood_among the nations alfred_nobel particularly in the later years of his life was much preoccupied with the problem of peace this emerges inter_alia from his correspondence with bertha_von suttner the author of the pacifist novel lay down your arms many people imbued with constructive ideas have like nobel both before and after his time devoted their attention to this apparently simple but as yet unsolved problem that of promoting brotherhood_among men and building a world free from war during the course of time many profound theories have been developed to show how international relations should be organized in order to ensure the attainment of peace personally i have found no answer either in the works of the philosophers or in those of the legal experts maybe after all the only valid solution is to be found in the simple words our own poet bjørnstjerne_bjørnson wrote as he lay on his deathbed in paris in 1910 these words formed the first line of a poem which was never completed but which begins as follows good_deeds save the world we have come together here_today to pay_tribute by the award of the nobel peace_prize to an organization unicef because in giving life to bjørnstjerne bjørnson's words it has fulfilled the condition of nobel's will the promotion of brotherhood_among the nations unicef was set_up by a united_nations resolution on december 11 1946 the resolution was unanimous but i well remember1 that in united_nations circles in new_york that autumn we had a great many discussions with various politicians as to whether the un really ought to organize a children's fund the united_nations many maintained was a political forum which was not justified in dealing with such minor peripheral problems as aid to children during the war the organization unrra had carried_out large scale humanitarian work for children prisoners and refugees in europe and in china for various reasons it was now being liquidated 2 a number of people expressed the opinion that now that peace was a fact national children's organizations should take over the work of caring for the children of each country today there is no disagreement on justifying unicef as part of the united_nations as you know it is not always easy to achieve unanimity in the united_nations this is understandable when one considers that we are dealing here with 118 member states representing every race nation political ideology and religious creed but everyone has understood the language of unicef and even the most reluctant person is bound to admit that in action unicef has proved that compassion knows no national_boundaries as soon as all the resolutions relative to the form of organization mandate and financing of unicef were clarified the organization set to work it was a blessing for unicef and the millions of children it took to its heart that from the very first day of its existence it had a leader like mr maurice_pate 3 he was unicef's never slumbering conscience he never allowed formalities to impede him in his work in his opinion the essential object was that good_deeds should be carried_out as swiftly and as effectively as possible he recruited his fellow workers from among those_who were prepared uncompromisingly to quote bjørnson to pursue the policy of compassion maurice_pate was the head of unicef for eighteen years up to his death this year he was an unassuming person but on the road that leads to peace where politicians are still groping their way in the dark maurice_pate has lit many a candle he has been succeeded by henry labouisse 4 a man eminently qualified by experience for this task who was chosen by maurice_pate nominated by the secretary_general and unanimously approved by the executive board 5 unicef's first field of operations was in europe what did europe look like in 1946 and how were europe's children living at the conclusion of the world war the swedish poet hjalmar gullberg provides us with an unforgettable picture in his poem europe's children that we had fixed the padlock on our fate that hardly mattered though finespun dreams had lulled the very soul our peace of mind was shattered beyond the palings europe's children hold aloft their begging bowl these were the children unicef came to help in europe during that fearful bitter winter of 1947 undernourished ill clad in rags homeless and starved after five_years of war and occupation we came across them everywhere in the ruins of cities in refugee camps in bombed villages in hungary yugoslavia albania poland italy greece rumania and austria unicef itself calculated that in europe in 1947 the number of needy children amounted to twenty million it was for these children in fourteen different countries that unicef provided a lifeline a stream of food medicine clothes and footwear never before had we witnessed an international relief campaign for children on such a scale during the winter of 1947 1948 unicef was able to report that it gave six_million children and mothers one meal everyday fortunately the economic reconstruction of europe after the war proceeded relatively quickly after four or five_years our countries were able to look after their children themselves but no sooner did the european aid program approach a point of solution than the outlines of another menacing specter appeared the inconceivable social misery of the developing_countries as each of these countries solved its problem of national independence the plight of their child population came more sharply into focus suddenly in one single year 1960 we find seventeen new states inscribed on the map of africa in a matter of a few years the membership of the united_nations rose from fifty one states to 118 the majority of these new states are what we call developing_countries various factors among them the modern mass media of communication tv and broadcasting with their dissemination of factual information on the social misery endured in these countries made it a moral imperative for the wealthy nations of the west to come to the assistance of these countries the united_nations economic and social council soon realized the scope of this task and the efforts of its many specialist organizations such as the world health_organization fao and unicef were directed to this work in 1946 unicef had been organized as a provisional emergency organization in 1953 the united_nations general_assembly decided to make unicef its permanent child aid organization with the emphasis on work in the developing_countries unicef now took up the second great task in its history that of improving the indescribably miserable conditions in which hundreds of millions of children lived in the developing_countries unicef cannot do this work on its own it can work only in countries whose governments solicit its aid and the countries receiving this aid must contribute at least as much as unicef itself in carrying_out aid programs while the aid given by unicef generally consists of technical assistance and of commodities and equipment which must be purchased with foreign currency the recipient country makes its contribution in the form of its own products local personnel transport services and so on the interest in unicef's aid programs for children has been so great that the contribution of governments now comprises two and a half dollars for every unicef dollar that is given in fact the aim of unicef's work is precisely to provide a spur to self help the aid given must cover all children in an area regardless of race creed nationality or political conviction at the head of unicef today there is a board consisting of representatives from thirty member countries it is this board that lays down the broad outlines of the work to be carried_out evaluates requests for help and decides the extent of such help today unicef's secretariat consists of some 600 persons some of them working at the headquarters in new_york and some at the thirty regional offices in europe america asia and africa unicef is financed by gifts from governments private individuals and organizations in 1964 118 countries contributed a total of thirty three million dollars what does unicef accomplish with this money first of all it must be borne in mind that the field of work to be covered is enormous embracing over 118 developing_countries with a total population of 750 million children whose needs for better food better health and better teaching are far far greater than the modest 200 million kroner now at the disposal of unicef this sum corresponds approximately to the amount which is spent in the world today every two hours for armaments however let_us not be dismayed at the thought of the still inadequate amounts of money available what is most_important is that for the first time in history we possess an international device capable of tackling the giant task of liberating the children of the developing_countries who are all of them our joint responsibility from ignorance disease malnutrition and starvation the most_important thing is not the precise amount in terms of hard cash what is far more important is the breakthrough of international cooperation that unicef represents the english historian arnold toynbee says that our century will probably be remembered not for its two world wars but as the period in history when for the first time the idea of mutual help between people aimed_at raising the standard of living everywhere was accepted today through its work unicef is helping to confirm this conception of the twentieth century when unicef started operations in the developing_countries the task appeared so overwhelming that it was difficult to know where to begin to people aware of the tremendous advances made by medical science in the countries of the west and the comprehensive health services enjoyed by the inhabitants of these countries it seemed outrageous that hundreds of millions of children should be suffering from diseases which we today have means of combating this group wanted to give first priority to the campaign against such national scourges as malaria trachoma tuberculosis and yaws others pointed to the limitless extent of undernourishment and malnutrition on the one hand and the tremendous surplus stores of grain and meat in western countries on the other_hand they would have preferred to concentrate on the campaign to raise the standard of nutrition a third group pointed to the necessity of overcoming illiteracy since an ignorant population could not possibly achieve the economic_growth that was needed which of these courses did unicef choose it can be said that all three problems were approached simultaneously for it was realized that these evils disease starvation and ignorance form arcs of the same vicious_circle when we consider the results that unicef has achieved today we must keep in mind that they have been achieved in fruitful cooperation with the world health_organization with fao unesco and the various technical aid organizations within the united_nations cooperating with the world health_organization unicef has made a sizeable contribution in the fight_against malaria a disease which by 1955 attacked an estimated 200 million victims annually of whom two million died when one hears these staggering figures he asks himself is there any use at all in taking up the fight one of the best examples of the progress that has been achieved comes to us from mexico where unicef together with other un organs was able to call on the services of 2,800 men who on foot on horseback and in motorboats traversed the length and breadth of the country disinfecting three million houses with ddt in the course of 1960 alone not a single death due to malaria was reported in 1960 agricultural production too went up and the government is now planning to move several million people from the central overpopulated highland areas down to the areas along the coast which are now free from malaria in combating the painful and sinister disease of yaws unicef has made a major contribution in 1946 this scourge afflicted a total of fifty million victims while the disease is not fatal it results in the stunting and disfigurement of the human body and yet this sickness which brings so much misery to the individual can be completely cured by a single shot of penicillin at a cost of five kroner when indonesia became independent in 1949 its government asked unicef to assist in the fight_against yaws it was calculated in 1950 that ten_million people in indonesia suffered from this ailment with the world health_organization unicef has succeeded in liberating whole villages from this disease and in a few years time yaws will be completely eradicated in indonesia we could also mention the ten_million children who were treated for the tremendously infectious eye malady known as trachoma or the treatment given to millions of lepers in as many as thirty five countries mass examinations of the population and anti tb vaccinations have also been carried_out on a massive scale in the prosperous parts of the world we are concerned with our diet problem many people are concerned because they eat too much and they worry about the ill effects in the developing_countries unfortunately the problem is the very opposite experts calculate that in these countries half the population are undernourished or suffer from malnutrition one of the results is an infant mortality rate of up to four hundred per thousand in norway it is seventeen per thousand unicef has launched a number of projects in an endeavor to improve the nutrition of mothers and children this work is carried on through information work in the nearly 20,000 health centers for mothers and children that unicef has organized it is also done by granting financial aid for the building of dairies of factories for the production of dried milk and for the conservation of milk or as in chile for building a factory for the production of large quantities of fishmeal the aim is primarily to encourage the production of foodstuffs rich in protein such as fish which can be bred on a large scale in fish farms or in paddy fields under water unicef's initiative in these areas is important because it represents the first systematic attempt ever made to coordinate scientific endeavors all over the world to produce food rich in protein for children in the developing_countries i have mentioned a third area the struggle_against illiteracy to which unicef in collaboration with unesco has made a notable contribution if we review unicef's activities we shall find that during these years it has carried_out hundreds of aid programs in developing_countries in the health nutrition and education field today unicef is about to embark on a third stage in its development at the moment there is a tremendous interest in most developing_countries in working out nationwide schemes of economic planning in the discussion revolving around these development plans the primary matter of interest is how large investments can be made in industry agriculture and communications and yet maybe these words of nehru6 contain a dangerous truth in one way or another in all our thinking on development plans for factory plants and machinery we lose sight of the fact that in the last analysis development depends on the human factor it is this fundamental viewpoint that prompts unicef's efforts at the present time to ensure that the interests of the children are safeguarded in the development plans now being drawn_up unicef is here building on the principle of the child's right to social security and education and of other rights adopted by the united_nations in 1959 in the declaration of the rights of the child 7 and in the same way as we have seen the fundamental_principles of the declaration of human_rights incorporated in the constitutions of many of the new countries it is hoped that it will be possible to incorporate the rights of the child in the economic and social structure of these new states it is this hope that inspired the invitation that was sent out to attend the round table conference in italy initiated by unicef in 1964 those_who took_part in this conference were ministers economists and child welfare experts the conclusion arrived at was that in the long_run no economic development is possible unless the growth of a healthy and enlightened generation of children is given priority in the plans for development maximum aid must be given by the prosperous countries if this gigantic task is to be accomplished and we possess the material and technical potential for giving this aid the miracles of technology seem to be limitless we have within our grasp the possibility of satisfying practically every material need on earth in fact in our ambition we move beyond the confines of this world literally stretching our arms toward the moon on the other_hand there are millions of people who do not possess a spade for digging their meager soil today the people of the developing_countries are fully alive to their own misery and they are determined to leave it behind they contemplate the riches of the west our surplus food our fantastic technology the health and good things that we enjoy in life all our material well being and they compare them with the misery of their own children this contrast creates a dangerous tension factor which threatens the peace of the world the aim of unicef is to spread a table decked with all the good things that nature provides for all the children of the world for this reason the organization is a peace factor of great importance unicef has realized that children provide the key to the future the children of today make the history of the future unicef is now forging a link of solidarity between the rich and the poor countries in an age when so many people are terrified of the destructive effects of the forces that science has placed in our hands unicef offers young people in all countries an alternative worth living and working for a world with freedom for all people equality between all races brotherhood_among all men 1 mrs lionaes was a norwegian delegate to the un 1946

labouisse director labouisse's superb qualifications and his devotion to unicef's aims made it natural for un secretary_general u thant to nominate him as maurice pate's successor we have the honor and pleasure of having director labouisse with us here_today to receive the nobel peace_prize on_behalf of unicef 6 jawaharlal nehru 1889 1964 indian statesman prime_minister of india 1947 1964 7 a declaration setting forth the world's obligations to its children including those of giving children affection and security and of bringing them up in a spirit of understanding tolerance friendship among peoples peace and universal brotherhood principle 10 the last time the nobel peace_prize was awarded to an individual was in 1964 the prize for that year was given to martin_luther king today he is no_longer alive on april 4 of this year so bitter a year for human_rights he fell at his post as leader of the negroes nonviolent struggle for their rights his death was one of the most grievous losses ever suffered by the world's champions of peace and goodwill the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament gratefully remembers martin_luther king and invokes peace for his memory on november 27 1895 in the swedish club of paris alfred_nobel signed his testament which later became so famous this was almost exactly one year before his death on december_10 1896 at san remo in italy as is well_known nobel decided that the income from his fortune should be divided into five equal parts and given as prizes to those_who had made the greatest contributions to mankind there is one sentence in this very short testament of his which makes us think of this_year's peace_prize laureate professor réne_cassin that sentence is it is my express wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates so that the most worthy shall receive the prize whether he be a scandinavian or not it is this respect for human worth irrespective of nationality race religion sex or social position which animates professor cassin's life and work and it is primarily for his contribution to the protection of human worth and the rights of man as set_forth in the universal_declaration of human_rights that the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament today awards the nobel peace_prize to réne_cassin réne_cassin was born in 1887 in bayonne in southern france he drafted the united_nations declaration of human_rights which was adopted on december_10 1948 exactly twenty_years ago today at that time cassin was about sixty years old but although it was only then that his name became internationally known he already had a long and rich life of service to mankind behind him shortly after cassin had completed his legal education he was mobilized in the first world war in 1916 a german bullet made him a war invalid and from then on he was mobilized in the demanding struggle for peace let_me mention the great efforts he made during the aftermath of the war in behalf of the disabled soldiers the war widows and the 800,000 orphaned french children the organization which he formed and directed for their benefit had nearly one million members 1 and it was cassin who was the driving_force behind the social legislation which assured these war victims the social and economic protection they had a right to his work for those affected by the war was not limited to france in 1921 and the years following he arranged several conferences of war veterans from italy poland germany czechoslovakia and austria as late as 1932 and 1933 large demonstrations were organized in support of the disarmament conference 2 because of the disastrous political developments during the 1930_s in europe the growing fascism and nazism these attempts to establish a climate of peace and understanding among the war veterans from all countries came to an end from 1924 until 1938 cassin worked within the league of nations for disarmament when the war in france in 1940 led to an armistice after a few months rene cassin was the first civilian to leave bordeaux in response to general de gaulle's appeal on june 20 he reached london where he became de gaulle's minister of justice in exile here he prepared among other_things the agreement between winston churchill and de gaulle which was to become the charter of the free french forces 3 the vichy government4 then deprived him of his french citizenship and sentenced him to death in absentia the end of the second_world war was the beginning of perhaps the most_important stage in réne cassin's life it was at this time that the people of all countries first came to understand clearly what the dimensions and what the nature of hitler's war had been it had not been merely a total war for a political objective it had been an annihilation of ethnic groups a genocide which the world had never before experienced public_opinion was stunned by the reports of the atrocities in the concentration_camps and of the extermination of those of jewish origin the general horror found expression in demands made on the governments of all nations to prevent a repetition of this assault on the value of human_beings by adopting an international bill of rights this idea was realized in 1945 when the united_nations included the establishment of a commission on human_rights in its charter the commission's task was to compose a universal_declaration of human_rights and an international convention which would bind the states to make these rights a reality through one of history's whims it was a representative of france réne_cassin and a representative of the united_states eleanor roosevelt5 who became the architects of the declaration of human_rights over a hundred years before both of these nations had adopted declarations guaranteeing the basic rights of man i_am referring to the american declaration of independence in 1776 and the french declaration of the rights of man in 1789 but the declaration of human_rights which eleanor roosevelt and réne_cassin were to leave their marks upon so firmly moved the stakes farther ahead than had either the american declaration of independence in 1776 or the french declaration of the rights of man in 1789 that is it was also in the articles which dealt with economic and social rights being influenced by the russian declaration of rights of 1918.6 eleanor roosevelt was the chairman of the commission on human_rights and réne_cassin its vice chairman but it was cassin who drew up the declaration perhaps some will say that the work for the rights of man the struggle_against discrimination toward the colored races toward minorities religious groups and women that all of this is noble but does it have anything to do with peace no one has given a better more truthful answer than nordahl grieg7 has given in these words in his poem to youth quot here is your protection against violence here is your sword the belief in our life the worth of mankind the fifty nations which adopted the united_nations charter in san francisco in april 1945 were also fully cognizant of the fact that lasting peace had to be built upon respect for the rights and worth of the individual human being for what kind of peace can there be in a country where the people are not free where they cannot express their thoughts or print their words where they are not equal before the law where they are subject to torture and degrading treatment in the preamble of the charter it is established that the objectives are peace and security in the next section the member countries confirm their belief in the fundamental rights of man and the worth of the individual it was this firm belief in the relation between respect for the rights of man and preservation of peace which lay behind the united_nations decision to work out this first universal_declaration of human_rights the commission on human_rights was confronted by a very difficult task to be sure the united_nations charter does mention several times that it will promote human_rights but we do not find these rights defined anywhere in the charter so the question was what did human_rights mean to the people from these fifty or sixty nations coming as they did from all parts of the world and from different levels of cultural development with diverse traditions religions and ideologies the west european peoples have a somewhat similar understanding of this concept but what do the chinese the indonesians and the people on haiti see in the words freedom equality and cultural and economic rights were there in general any points of contact between the welfare states conception of these terms and that of the developing_countries for example in the european countries we can agree rather readily on what we mean by the woman's legal position in society but how is it interpreted by the people in those parts of the world where a woman's value is equated with that of four camels in view of all these difficulties it is not surprising that it took the commission two years to work out formulations which everyone could accept at the united_nations general_assembly at paris in 1948 but even there where a completely prepared draft was presented to us 8 we spent two months in ninety seven meetings discussing the declaration and a total of 1,200 ballots was taken on proposed amendments before the declaration with its thirty articles was finally adopted but we had thus brought into existence a declaration which stands as a standard for the common values of man wherever he may live in the world whatever the social system he may live under the countries which voted for the declaration did not commit_themselves but declared themselves in agreement that all people should have the right to life liberty and security of person that all are equal before the law that everyone is entitled to freedom of conscience of religion of expression and of assembly that everyone is entitled to the right to work to equal compensation for equal work to reasonable working hours and to free education finally the last article article 30 states nothing in this declaration may be interpreted as implying for any state group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed_at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set_forth herein to us who sit here these rights sound like self_evident truths a glance at conditions in the world around us will convince us however that in many states yes in most states the promises of this simple declaration are written in sand in the area of international_law however the declaration was a product of new thought whereas earlier treaties had regulated the relationships between nations and governments this new declaration made the individual himself the focus man should be guaranteed these rights in whatever system of social organization he may live therefore we can say that the declaration of human_rights is the constitution of a world society it expresses our common ideals and it embodies a goal which everyone can strive to attain it is a standard by which we can measure the quality of the political system of any country the declaration puts therefore a dividing line in history it breaks away from the old set doctrines of international_law yes it allows us to look out over the boundaries of the old sovereign states toward a world society i know that the skeptics and pessimists will be quick to say that this lies a long way off and i know they are right but let_us look for some bright spots for they are there we can see how the principles in the declaration of human_rights have already taken root in men's minds many of the seventy or eighty new sovereign states established since the war have incorporated parts of or even the entire declaration in their constitutions from a historical point of view i still believe that it is correct to say that the adoption of the declaration of human_rights on december_10 1948 marked the beginning of a new era it might very well be the beginning of a revolutionizing evolution which will realize president roosevelt's dream a world with freedom from fear and freedom from want 9 the commission on human_rights spent two years on the rough draft of the declaration in its extremely laborious work in which each and every concept and the validity of each and every word were thoroughly aired in all languages professor cassin held a key position he formulated defined and clarified he was crystal clear in his formulations and steadfast in his goal but always cooperative and tolerant of the opinions of others he upheld his ideas vigorously but whenever he realized they had no immediate chance of being accepted he was wise enough not to force the issue but to bide his time the years that followed which saw many new nations and new needs arise proved to be ready for several of the proposals initially rejected in 1948 but now integrated in the text of the convention cassin also played a positive role as a mediator between the western european way of thought which emphasized civil and political rights and the eastern european viewpoint which laid more weight on economic social and cultural rights and when the declaration of human_rights that came from many minds many religions many ideologies and many hearts was finally constructed it was primarily the engineering feat of réne_cassin then how satisfied is professor cassin today with his work in an article in the jerusalem post several weeks ago he says the declaration holds up an ideal for us and it draws the guide lines for our actions but a glance at reality today is enough to show us that we are far from the ideal no country not even the most advanced can pride itself on fulfilling all the articles of the declaration once the war and the ideals for which we fought have faded in the distance and new states have gained their independence they are inclined to conduct their domestic affairs as they wish without regard to human_rights we are witnessing the violation of the right to live murders and massacres are perpetrated with impunity the exploitation of women mass hunger disregard for freedom of conscience and for freedom of speech widespread racial_discrimination all these evils are far too prevalent to be overlooked 10 but professor cassin does_not despair over these shortcomings he points to the significance of educational work not only among children but also among adults in producing fertile soil for the growth of the declaration's ideas and it was no coincidence that cassin also became one of the authors of the unesco charter 11 in the work of making the declaration of human_rights legally binding among the states réne_cassin has actively participated in the preparation of the two covenants which eighteen years after the declaration were unanimously adopted by the united_nations general_assembly on december 1966 during the eighteen years separating acceptance of the declaration in 1948 and realization of the convention in 1966 an important political development has taken_place in individual countries and in the world as a whole as an indication of this development one can cite the fact that approximately sixty new countries became members of the united_nations between 1948 and 1966 these new states had some interests entirely different from those of the other states in the united_nations for them it was not a question of the old world's classical political rights but of the principles concerning the right of self determination for their countries and of control over their economic development consequently one can say perhaps that these merging nations stood at the beginning of a development which the industrialized countries had long since completed this strong new element in the united_nations also left its imprint on the texts of the two covenants giving them a wider scope than the declaration had originally aimed_at nevertheless for the first time in history two international conventions intended to give man certain fundamental rights were unanimously adopted no country has yet ratified these two covenants one on civil and political rights and one on economic social and cultural rights thirty five states must ratify them before they are valid it should be mentioned as a hopeful note that the norwegian government has declared itself willing to submit to the parliament a proposal for the ratification of the convention as soon as it is technically possible it is reasonable to expect that the other scandinavian countries will do the same it was on just such a cold december day as this exactly twenty_years ago a little before midnight in the palais de chaillot this historic declaration of human worth and human_rights was adopted by the general_assembly of the united_nations 12 to the millions of people who live today in the darkness of oppression this document was unknown but a small light was lit and the moral commandments contained in the declaration like those written on the tablets of moses will in the years to come play a forceful role in reforming the conscience of man and his understanding of what is right and wrong today where there is no respect for human_rights and freedom there is no peace either every day youth falls on the battlefield every day prisoners are led to prisons and torture chambers they fight and they suffer for the ideals which the declaration of human_rights proclaims but the demand is made not only of them it is made also of each and every one of us who live in such secure conviction that we have received these rights as inalienably our own it is this very year of 1968 precisely the year of human_rights that has given us the tragic proof of the old truth peace like freedom is indivisible it must be captured anew by everyone every_single day 1 the

as international human_rights year when alfred_nobel died on december_10 1896 his will and testament revealed that he had instituted five nobel prizes one for physics one for chemistry one for literature one for medicine and a peace_prize while swedish institutions were entrusted with the task of awarding the first four prizes nobel decided for reasons not exactly known that a committee of five members appointed by the norwegian_parliament should be entrusted with the great honor and responsibility of awarding the peace_prize alfred_nobel not only specified who was to award the peace_prize but he also laid_down the rules to be followed by the committee in choosing a candidate for the prize he states in his will that the peace_prize is to be awarded to the person who has done most to promote fraternity among the nations with this consideration in mind the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament has awarded the peace_prize for 1969 to the international labor organization beneath the foundation stone of the ilo's main office in geneva lies a document on which is written si vis pacem cole justitiam if you desire peace cultivate justice there are few organizations that have succeeded to the extent that the ilo has in translating into action the fundamental moral idea on which it is based why we may ask did the demand for social_justice receive such a tremendous impetus when the ilo was founded fifty_years ago i think the answer is to be found in the fact that at the conclusion of the first world war in 1918 the underprivileged members of the community were in the historical position of being able not only to obtain the ear of europe's leading politicians for social_justice but also of being strong_enough should the need arise to back their demands with force during the war the working_class had loyally set aside their own claims in order to serve their national cause and they had in full measure borne the sufferings and privations of war but at trade_union congresses held in 1916 1917 and 1918 the demand was made that the trade_union movement should participate in discussing the future peace treaty it was emphasized that workers should be guaranteed a minimum standard of working conditions after the war and that a permanent body to ensure the carrying_out of international legislation in this respect should be established in the wake of hostilities came a spate of violent social and political upheavals it is sufficient to remind you of the russian revolution of 1917 and the german revolution of 1918 with such a background it was something of a political imperative when the peace treaties in versailles in 1919 were to be drafted to include clauses which aimed to secure peace not only among nations but also among classes in the various countries at its very outset the peace conference took the unprecedented step of setting_up an international committee for labor legislation the committee consisted not only of government delegates but also of employers and employees including samuel gompers1 the u.s.a trade_union leader and france's leon jouhaux politicians were represented by harold butler2 of the united kingdom and eduard benes3 of czechoslovakia in this way the ilo along with the league of nations became part of the versailles treaties in which guidelines for international socio political cooperation were laid_down 4 reading this special section of the versailles treaty and bearing in mind that it was written in 1919 one is compelled to agree with paal berg5 when he declares that this was one of the most remarkable diplomatic documents ever seen in the treaty for instance is the following the league of nations has for its object the establishment of universal peace and such a peace can be established only if it is based upon social_justice and whereas conditions of labor exist involving such injustice hardship and privation to large numbers of people as to produce unrest so great that the peace and harmony of the world are imperiled and an improvement of those conditions is urgently required as for example by the regulation of the hours of work including the establishment of a maximum working day and week the regulation of the labor supply the prevention of unemployment the provision of an adequate living wage the protection of the worker against sickness disease and injury arising out of his employment the protection of children young persons and women provision for old age and injury protection of the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own recognition of the principle of freedom of association the organization of vocational and technical education and other measures the failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labor is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own countries 6 this statement is followed by the guidelines for the ilo and the principal tasks this organization should aim to accomplish these are summed up in nine points which have often been called the magna carta of the working_class among other_things these include the principle that labor is not a piece of merchandise the right of employees as well as of employers to organize themselves the right of workers to receive a reasonable wage the eight hour day or the forty eight hour week a ban on child labor equal pay for men and women for the same work and every country is furthermore to organize a system of labor inspection in which women too are to play their part in ensuring that labor legislation is adhered to the ilo was organized as a specialized organization under the league of nations to carry_out this program and what has been the result have the fine words in a solemn document come true or were they merely writing in the sand a remote vision glimpsed by impractical dreamers as we look at the world around us today we must admit that many of the aims that the ilo set itself have been achieved in many parts of the industrialized world working earnestly and untiringly the ilo has succeeded in introducing reforms that have removed the most flagrant injustices in a great many countries particularly in europe by means of a levering of income and a progressive policy of social welfare the ilo has played its part in these countries in bridging the gap between rich and poor how has the ilo succeeded in carrying_out such significant parts of its program i believe that part of the answer is to be found in the special form of organization peculiar to the ilo the ilo's resolutions passed at the annual labor conferences are backed by discussions and negotiations in which not only government delegates participate but also independent representatives of leading employers and employees organizations in every_single country joint discussions of problems between these three independent interest groups create a possibility of arriving at realistic solutions of important social problems as well as of deciding how these measures are to be carried_out in practice in the various countries this is the structure of the organization but its decisive feature what makes the mechanism work is naturally the people themselves farseeing men of goodwill inspired with a belief in the possibility of building a peaceful world based_on social_justice what means are at the disposal of the ilo in order to implement its program in the first place the ilo aims to create international legislation ensuring certain norms for working conditions in every country in the course of its fifty_years of existence the ilo has adopted a total of 128 conventions and 132 recommendations these cover a wide range from working hours to equal pay for equal work from health insurance to the abolition of forced labor from social security for foreign workers to the task of securing the rights of trade_unions but are these measures respected in the various countries are they incorporated as part and parcel of the national laws or do delegates in geneva vote for the most sweeping resolutions which are then consigned to the bottom drawer in some government department after the delegates go home it is precisely in this area that the ilo one of the first international organizations in the world to do so has pioneered in the international sphere by creating organs which carry_out the work of supervising the implementation of the conventions adopted by member states and their embodiment in national law and practice time does_not permit_me to illustrate this important point in detail let_me merely mention that the ilo's constitution obliges member states to draw up annual reports stating what measures have been taken to observe the provisions contained in the ratified conventions another important point is that the ilo constitution gives the organizations in a country the right to lodge a complaint if a government fails to carry_out the conventions which the authorities of that country have ratified the right to lodge a complaint also includes the right of a state to prosecute a member state for violating provisions in conventions that both states have ratified during these fifty_years the ilo has adopted over 250 conventions and recommendations and even_though not all its 121 member countries have come anywhere close to ratifying all the conventions i believe we are justified in saying that the ilo has permanently influenced the social welfare legislation of every_single country norway has not ratified all the conventions as yet but i_am glad to be able to state that norway occupies seventh place among all member countries of the ilo with regard to the number of ratifications having ratified a total of sixty three out of 128 conventions the norwegian minister of social welfare mr aarvik declared at this_year's labor conference in geneva that out of sixty three agreements that our country has ratified not less_than forty three have had an important influence on the development of working conditions and social welfare in norway when war_broke out in 1939 the ilo was naturally faced with great difficulties the organization moved to montreal in canada where it continued its work for freedom and democracy against nazism and dictatorship one of the most_important events in the activities of the ilo during the war was the labor conference held in philadelphia in 1944 on the occasion of the twenty fifth jubilee of the organization forty one states among them norway were represented at this conference the philadelphia conference constitutes an historic milestone in the development of the ilo because apart from confirming the principles of the organization as adopted in 1919 it also drafted a declaration expressing a new and more dynamic conception of the ilo's aims and responsibilities with regard to combating insecurity and poverty at the invitation of president roosevelt the conference was concluded with a meeting in the white house in washington in a speech to the conference roosevelt stated that the philadelphia declaration was an historic document on a level with the united_states own declaration of independence in 1776 when the war was over and the united_nations organization was established in 1945 the ilo was linked to uno as an independent specialized organization the ilo now had a far wider field of action than it had enjoyed during its first twenty_five years just as it may be said that one of the motivating forces for the foundation and constitution of the ilo in 1919 was the social and political upheaval that followed in the wake of the first world war so we can say that shifts in the international political balance of power after the second_world war proved deciding factors in expanding the aims of the ilo from 1945 on the old european colonial powers disintegrated and over sixty new states were given independent status on the map of the world and in time too in the ilo the ilo was no_longer an essentially european organization dominated by the special conditions in industrialized europe the ilo had become primarily a global organization whose membership represented practically all races and religions in the world whose traditions culture and history economic and social problems were entirely different from those with which the ilo had had to deal before the war after the first world war the main task of the ilo was to build a bridge between the poor and the rich within individual countries after the second_world war its task was a far more formidable one that of building a bridge between the poor and the rich nations today it can be said that the dominant feature in the work of the ilo during the last twenty_years has been technical aid programs in the developing_countries working in close cooperation with uno and its many specialized organizations such as fao unesco the world health_organization the international atomic energy commission and others and with financial support from uno the ilo has succeeded in carrying_out research projects and making basic investments in developing_countries with a view to developing their agriculture industry and other sides of their economic life the birth of new states in africa and asia has not only enlarged the ilo's scope of activity it has also created a certain internal political tension in the organization which we sincerely hope can be overcome the basic reason for this tension is that the ilo's special form of organization with independent representatives for governments for free trade_union organizations and for employers associations has created problems with regard to the membership of new countries because many of them have not as yet developed free labor organizations in these new countries governments nominate both workers and employers representatives this is in complete violation of one of the fundamental_principles on which the whole organizational structure of ilo is based as yet we do not know how this conflict will develop but it is vital to the whole future of the ilo that it should be solved in such a way that the independent and political neutrality of the ilo can be preserved it is primarily the economic and social problems in the developing_countries that have confronted the ilo with the tremendous task which it has undertaken to accomplish during the next ten_years and which has been called the world employment program in the rich industrialized countries we consider an ample supply of labor a sign of wealth since the war we have also gradually learned the technique of controlling the economic climate in such a way that we have avoided the unemployment with which as a mass phenomenon we were familiar before the war in the developing_countries on the other_hand unemployment and underemployment are today social evils which hold millions of people in the grip of hopeless poverty a certain growth can be noted in the economic life of these countries but on the other_hand a population_explosion is taking place which prevents this growth from promoting a rise in the standard of living of the whole nation millions of people consequently live on the borderline of the physical subsistence level without any hope of enjoying their share in a progressive development the ilo calculates that by 1970 the population of the world will have reached a figure of 3,600,000,000 people of these 1,500,000,000 will comprise able bodied men and women but in the course of the decade commencing in 1970 the able bodied population of the world will increase by 280,000,000 people it is disturbing to contemplate that the bulk of this growth namely 226,000,000 people will take place in countries with the least possibility for finding them employment whereas the industrialized countries in which today there is frequently a pressing need to increase the labor force will show an increase of only 56,000,000 people how then will the ilo tackle this gigantic task of finding work for the whole population of the world and what possibilities has the ilo of solving the problem which has loomed largest during our century that of reducing nay removing the gap between the rich and the poor nations of the world and of adjusting the population_explosion to a harmonious economic and social evolution at the ilo's fiftieth jubilee conference in geneva this summer the director_general of the ilo mr david a morse expressed the hope he entertains for carrying_out this plan in these words let_us make it possible for future generations to look_back on this fifty_years jubilee conference as the prelude to an epoch an epoch where the instinctive solidarity between the people of the world is mobilized in a joint worldwide attack on poverty this massed campaign against poverty will not only be organized by the ilo it will be supported by all the uno special organizations as part of uno's second development decade the first task of the ilo will be to send experts to those parts of the world covered by the project latin_america asia and africa to work with national authorities in drawing up a long_term plan formulating objectives for vocational training and employment of the population the other task will be to participate in a program of action which will give effect to the plans that have been drawn_up the ilo cannot of course on its own create new jobs but it can give advice and help to countries desirous of putting their populations to work the ilo can assist in such areas as the implementation of agrarian reforms agricultural projects industrialization public works the development of training and vocational guidance programs choice of investment possibilities development of trade and so on for this reason the ilo's plan does_not consist merely of collecting statistical data on the population aspects of the problems involved it will also have a direct bearing on the entire economic and social development in these areas through this work the ilo is endeavoring to promote the capacity of developing_countries to help themselves no help from outside however well intentioned and selfless it may be can take the place of the developing_countries own will to help themselves for this reason carrying through the world employment program will prove a challenge both to the developing_countries and to the industrialized countries if they can work realistically together they will also achieve their ideal aim a world living in peaceful coexistence the ilo's main task will be to ensure that this new world is based_on social_justice in other words to fulfill the command that is inscribed on the document in geneva si vis pacem cole justitiam if you desire peace cultivate justice and let_us add as a summing up of our experience during these fifty eventful years and as a guideline for the future just as peace is indivisible so also is justice 1 samuel gompers 1850 1924 president of american federation of labor 1886 1895 1896 1924 2 harold beresford butler 1883 1951 secretary to british

the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament must bear this criterion in mind in selecting the prizewinner from among the many candidates proposed what might be a benefit to humanity today many answers could be given just as varied as many sided and as interesting as man himself does history not offer one signpost indicating and for all time identifying the basic needs of man which it would be a benefit to satisfy one of the great historical events in europe during the course of our dramatic century the russian revolution of 1917 had this inscription on its banner bread and peace bread and peace present a combination of the vital needs mankind has always set as a goal vital to the development of its potential freedom from starvation was furthermore one of the freedoms our first global peace organization the united_nations recognized in 1945 as a basic human right to be secured for all people on october 16 1945 fao that is to say the united_nations organization for food and agriculture the first of uno's specialized agencies was established in 1949 fao's secretary_general the nutrition expert lord boyd_orr was awarded the nobel peace_prize this year the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament has awarded nobel's peace_prize to a scientist dr norman ernest borlaug because more_than any other single person of this age he has helped to provide bread for a hungry world we have made this choice in the hope that providing bread will also give the world peace who is this scientist who through his work in the laboratory and in the wheat fields has helped to create a new food situation in the world and who has turned pessimism into optimism in the dramatic race between population_explosion and our production of food norman borlaug a man of norwegian descent was born on march 25 1914 on a small farm in cresco iowa in the united_states and originally studied forestry at the university of minnesota it was as an agriculturalist however that he was to make his greatest contribution in 1944 borlaug was appointed to a post as a genetics expert with the rockefeller foundation in 1942 this foundation in cooperation with the mexican government had launched an agricultural program in mexico this project was directed by two outstanding plant pathologists professors stakman and j george harrar1 its aim was research into and a better exploitation of agricultural know how with a view to developing mexico's agriculture and in this way increasing and improving local food supplies for the outstanding contribution to peace this agricultural program represented the rockefeller foundation was proposed in 1962 as a candidate for nobel's peace_prize by ten members of the swedish parliament it is interesting to note that the norwegian academy of sciences in oslo as far back as 1951 elected the leader of this project professor stalman a member of its mathematical natural science class twenty_years later in 1970 his pupil dr norman e borlaug was made an honorary doctor by the norwegian agricultural college at ås the rector of this institution professor jul låg declared that this honor had been awarded for the following reason the basis for the award of the honorary doctoral degree to dr_borlaug is the impressive result he has achieved in wheat improvement and the organization of the exploitation of the results of this improvement in agriculture particularly in the developing_countries the new breeds of grain evolved by dr_borlaug and his assistants have resulted in improvements in harvest quantitatively and qualitatively that previously were considered hardly possible this distinction is only one of a great many academic honors conferred on dr_borlaug by universities and similar institutions in the usa pakistan india and canada dr_borlaug went to the international maize and wheat improvement center in 1944 today he is director of the wheat improvement program in mexico ever_since that day twenty_five years_ago when dr_borlaug started his work on the improvement of grain and right up to the present he has devoted all his energy to achieving the historical result which today is referred to all over the world as the green_revolution this revolution will make it possible to improve the living conditions of hundreds of millions of people in that part of the globe which today might be called as the non affluent world nations with ancient cultures which right up to modern times have suffered the scourge of recurrent hunger crises can now be self supporting in wheat a long and humiliating dependence on the so_called rich nations of the world for their daily bread will have been brought to an end behind the outstanding results in the sphere of wheat research of which the dry statistics speak we sense the presence of a dynamic indomitable and refreshingly unconventional research scientist dr_borlaug is not only a man of ideals but essentially a man of action reading his publications on the green_revolution one realizes that he is fighting not only weeds and rust fungus but just as much the deadly procrastination of the bureaucrats and the red tape that thwart quick action the following warning reminds us of this a strangulation of the world by exploding well camouflaged bureaucracies is one of the great threats to mankind 2 dr_borlaug cannot afford to wait there is an important cause weighing on his mind something that must be carried_out and must be carried_out now he puts it like this i_am impatient and do not accept the need for slow change and evolution to improve the agriculture and food production of the emerging countries i advocate instead a yield kick off or yield blast off there is no time to be lost considering the magnitude of the world food and population problem 3 apart from his work as a scientist and as an outstanding organizer in exploiting the results of research dr_borlaug has also been an inspiring leader for the many young scientists who have been trained at the wheat institute in mexico dr_borlaug prefers to teach his pupils out in the fields many people we are told who ask him to lecture or write a paper get the following reply what would you rather have bread or paper in 1944 when dr_borlaug started work on the mexican agricultural project there were not so many people concerned with the relationship_between the trends in population growth and the increase in food production in the world after the war when most colonial empires were gradually dismantled and sixty to seventy developing areas emerged as independent national states it was primarily the incredibly poor standard of health in these countries that appealed to our conscience through its world health_organization the united_nations launched a formidable attack in the 1950s on the major national diseases in these new states one of the results of the preventive medical measures set afoot was a drastic decrease in the mortality rate of the developing_countries and it was not until the 1960s that the prospects of a population_explosion constituted a menace not only to the developing_countries but to the whole world the population_explosion is being attacked essentially from two angles by information on family planning and by an increased effort first and foremost through research to increase the agricultural yield when borlaug and other scientists initiated their work at the wheat center in mexico the mexican authorities had little faith in their country's potential as an agricultural country it was assumed that the country had neither the climate nor the soil required for advanced agriculture the country spent a great_deal of its foreign currency importing the necessary wheat wheat researchers attached to the rockefeller foundation's project were set the task of helping mexico in as short a time as possible to help herself the scientists were to play the role not of consultants entrenched behind their documents in their offices but of active participants in the practical manual labor and toil in the fields for many young scientists this last principle may have entailed a somewhat unpalatable reassessment of their social status but it was undoubtedly a wholesome maxim in his writings on the green_revolution dr_borlaug relates that the mexican wheat program aimed to analyze all the factors that hampered production furthermore the idea was to train young scientists in all scientific disciplines associated with production the purpose of this research dr_borlaug continues was to endeavor to develop a variety of wheat with greater yields with a great degree of resistance to diseases and with qualities that rendered it suitable for use in connection with improved agronomic methods that is to say the use of artificial fertilizers improved soil culture and mechanization the result of the concerted attack launched by the team of scientists on all these problems was the new mexican breeds of wheat which are now generally known which produce astonishingly large yields which are resistant to disease and which facilitate intensive use of fertilizers unlike previously known breeds of wheat the new types can be transferred to remote parts of the world that differ in climate the most_important event in the mexican wheat improvement program was the development of the so_called dwarf varieties after years of research on the part of dr_borlaug and his collaborators to develop by crossing and selection the so_called japanese breed of wheat they evolved the now world famous dwarf variety these are breeds of wheat which unlike previously known long bladed varieties have short blades the long bladed varieties of wheat on which work was done in the 1950s gave increased yields but snapped when they were given more_than a certain amount of artificial fertilizer the new dwarf varieties were able to stand two or three times more artificial fertilizer and to provide an increase of yield per decare from the previous maximum of 450 kilos to as much as 800 kilos per decare these varieties can be used in various parts of the world because they are not affected by varying lengths of daylight they are better than all other kinds in both fertilized and non fertilized soil and with and without artificial irrigation in addition they are highly resistant to the worst enemy of wheat rust fungus or oromyces thanks to these high yield breeds of wheat mexico was self supporting in this grain in 1956 and in recent_years this country has exported several_hundred thousand tons annually at the invitation of fao dr_borlaug visited pakistan in 1959 he was instrumental in having a number of pakistani wheat experts sent to mexico to study the wheat research center there after striving hard to convince pakistani authorities and other foreign experts dr_borlaug persuaded the political leaders of pakistan to recognize the advantages of introducing the new mexican breeds of wheat into their country at that time the agriculture of west pakistan was producing a steady annual deficit in relation to national needs wheat yields were low approximately 100 kilos per decare on an average farming methods were primitive the soil had been overcropped and artificial fertilizer was a rarity after a successful struggle to overcome bureaucracy prejudice and even rumors to the effect that dr borlaug's variety of wheat would produce sterility and impotence among the population it was finally decided that pakistan should import a certain quantity of mexican seed corn of the new breed once the seed corn had been introduced and had yielded superb results in the form of increased crops the triumphal march of the green_revolution was ushered in pakistan's present day wheat production amounts to seven million tons and the country is self supporting in wheat that this could be achieved in the course of three or four years was due in no small measure to the fact that the president of pakistan had personally supported the program very strongly and to the fact that the results achieved in mexico could be used as a basis thus saving the country a great many years of research and experiment dr_borlaug was in india in 1963 in order to find out whether the breed of wheat he had developed in mexico could be used in this country too and history repeated itself the highest results in the history of india were achieved in 1968 with a crop of seventeen million tons this event was celebrated in india with the issue of a new postage stamp bearing the inscription the indian wheat revolution 1968 after the successful results achieved in mexico india and pakistan the new varieties of wheat were introduced into certain parts of turkey afghanistan iran iraq tunisia morocco and lebanon the soviet_union too is now interested in establishing contacts with the international maize and wheat research center in mexico this occasion is neither the time nor the place to give a detailed account of dr borlaug's great results in wheat research during the last twenty_five years but it has been established beyond doubt that his efforts have made possible an unequaled increase in wheat production and an improvement in quality that have postponed a crisis that a great many scientists have predicted would be the result of the growing gap between the population_explosion and food production an assessment of the effects of dr borlaug's great contribution makes obvious the fact that a whole series of factors is involved affecting not only economic social cultural and political affairs and these not solely in the various developing_countries but also affecting international relations problems of major importance such as the aid given by the industrialized countries to the developing_countries must also be basically reassessed it is obvious that we can no_longer count on the export of grain to the developing_countries loans for the purchase of industrial equipment and technical know how must be given greater priority the new variety of wheat will be able to effect a total transformation of the economic picture in the developing_countries society will be richer and industry will be more varied if the politicians at the same_time pursue an economic policy which aims at general economic_growth the increased earnings of agriculture will ensure ring effects in the form of growth impulses in all the activities created by more productive agriculture it will be possible to increase employment sowing fertilizing hoeing harvesting marketing will have to be carried_out several times a year seasonal unemployment will be reduced a balanced economic policy correctly pursued should make it possible to provide work for the large surplus of available manpower in the developing_countries it is maintained for example by lester brown in his book seeds of change that there might be a shortage of labor on a local basis the new technology in agriculture could also stimulate such branches of the economy as industry building and construction work throughout the social economy for instance the increase in crop yields will require the building of artificial fertilizer factories roads irrigation works railways warehouses silos and mills outlying districts will be able to receive the economic pollination necessary for the building of schools and hospitals from whatever angle we consider them the effects of the green_revolution will entail increased total production that will make the developing_countries economically better off and more independent of the aid provided by the affluent countries as far as foodstuffs are concerned in an article published in foreign_affairs the agricultural expert lester brown states that the new breed of grain in our age will have the same inpact on the agricultural revolution in asia that the steam engine had on the industrial revolution in europe in the eighteenth century 4 or as eugene black puts it the new grain varieties will be engines of change 5 not least these engines of change will transform the position of the peasant in the community and the peasant's attitude to his own situation in life a new policy of income distribution socially oriented will enable the peasant to break_out of the vicious_circle of poverty and the apathy which is a natural consequence of penury that offers no future prospects many writers who have dealt with the peasant population of developing_countries have maintained that the peasants are conservative in the sense that they do not want change but dr_borlaug who is a great admirer of the peasant maintains that when changes involve a rise in the standard of living the asiatic peasant too will accept change to quote dr_borlaug although the peasant farmer may be illiterate he can figure 6 the new varieties of grain and the capital input required will increase the peasants demands on the authorities for education transport agricultural credits and the like the capital hungry peasants could constitute a political pressure group which the authorities would have to take into consideration in framing their economic policy there would thus be an increase in political activity dr_borlaug realizes however that even_though the new varieties of grain will involve a considerable increase in the crop harvested by the peasants the green_revolution may also create social problems of a negative kind social injustices may well occur if politicians in the developing_countries should fail to ensure the requisite conditions by means of equitable taxation a system of agricultural credits at reasonable rates of interest a properly adjusted price policy and a defensible employment policy in his speech on august 20 of this year at the agricultural college at ås dr_borlaug expressed his social views as follows i've worked with wheat but wheat is merely a catalyst a part of the picture i'm interested in the total economic development in all countries only by attacking the whole problem can we raise the standard of living for all people in all communities so that they will be able to live decent lives this is something we wish for all people on this planet but this will be the responsibility and challenge to be faced by the political authorities in the countries concerned through his scientific contribution and his tremendous talent for organization dr_borlaug has introduced a dynamic factor into our assessment of the future and its potential he has enlarged our perspective he has given the economists the social planners and the politicians a few_decades in which to solve their problems to introduce the family planning the economic equalization the social security and the political liberty we must have in order to ensure everybody not least the impoverished undernourished and malnourished masses their daily bread and thus a peaceful future and this is precisely where dr_borlaug has made his great contribution to peace during the twenty_five years that have elapsed since the end of the war those of us who live in the affluent industrialized societies have debated in almost panic stricken terms the race between the world's population_explosion and the world's available food resources most experts who have expressed an opinion on the issue of this race have been pessimistic the world has been oscillating between fears of two catastrophes the population_explosion and the atom_bomb both pose a mortal threat in this intolerable situation with the menace of doomsday hanging over us dr_borlaug comes onto the stage and cuts the gordian knot he has given us a well founded hope an alternative of peace and of life the green_revolution the 1971 nobel peace_prize was awarded to willy_brandt the solemn prize award_ceremony took_place on december_10 in the assembly hall of the university of oslo their majesties the king and queen of norway honored the ceremony with their presence mr willy_brandt was in attendance the nobel foundation was represented by professor otto frostman after the opening of the ceremony with the egmond ouverture by ludwig van beethoven rendered by an orchestra conducted by mr öivind bergh the following speech was made by the president of the nobel_committee mrs aase lionæs in honor of the 1971 laureate mr willy_brandt your_royal highnesses_ladies and gentlemen a new war is casting its shadow on the nobel prize award_ceremony the fields once blessed by richer harvests through the research in wheat by the laureate of last year's nobel peace_prize normann borlaug are now bomb craters of death two developing_countries that are in desperate need of peace to rise from poverty india and pakistan are now at war the degree to which politicians worldwide have closed their eyes and hardened their hearts to the new afflictions imposed on the innocent victims of war in these countries is appalling against this dark background we double our thanks to those that work hard for peace our thoughts today focus mainly on someone who is no_longer with us dr ralph_bunche ralph_bunche was awarded the nobel peace_prize in 1950 for his contribution to the armistice between israel and the arab_states dr bunche was a noble and faithful advocate of peace throughout his long life of peace between races and peace between peoples he has been one of un:s most unselfish servants for 25 years he will always be remembered with profound gratitude by the nobel_committee of the norwegian_storting parliament seventy years have now passed since the first award of the nobel peace_prize in 1901 the prize was shared between the swiss henri_dunant and the frenchman frédéric passy henri dunant's compassionate work for prisoners of war and people disabled in war lead as is well_known to the foundation of the red_cross in 1864 and the establishment of the geneva_convention and frédéric passy's pioneer work for volontary arbitration in international conflicts resulted among other_things in the institution of the interparliamentary union in 1889 at this milestone it seems natural to stop for a moment to think of the man who through his exceptional will laid the foundation for the nobel prizes the most glorious of all international marks of honour many have wondered why alfred_nobel whose main research area was chemistry would give one fifth of his estate for the founding of a peace_prize the suggested reasons for this have also been many maybe he was influenced by the peace ideals of the english poet shelley or maybe more likely it was his close friendship with the peace advocate bertha_von suttner that lead him in this direction in a letter to her nobel discusses the possibility of organized work for world peace a rather remarkable idea at the time and as it turned out also a profetic one he writes the best solution would be a treaty whereby all governments commit_themselves to jointly defend one another in case of an attack this would subsequently lead to partial demobilization with the creation of the un in 1945 this vision of nobel's became one of the fundamental_principles in the organization's charter many attempts have been made during these 70 years to realize nobel's dream of peace this year the nobel_committee of the norwegian_storting have chosen to give the peace_prize to a man for whom the ideal of peace has been a guiding star throughout his active political career federal chancellor willy_brandt willy_brandt is the fourth german citizen who has been awarded the nobel peace_prize we remember his predecessors foreign_secretary gustav stresemann mr ludwig quidde the historian and the journalist carl_von ossietzky willy_brandt was born in lübeck in 1913 his early youth coincides with one of the most tragic periods in the modern history of germany the advance of nazism and the atroceous violations by the hitler dictatorship of human_dignity first in germany but later also in many other european countries the pattern of willy_brandt's life was formed by his resistance to the nazi regime violations already in 1933 at the early_age of 19 he came to norway as a political refugee in norway he spent seven important years of his youth as an active journalist brandt shared his time between work studies and intensive efforts to help the victims of nazism both those that were refugees outside germany and those that were held captive in german concentration_camps on november 23 of 1936 the nobel_committee of the norwegian_storting decided to award the peace_prize to the german pacifist carl_von ossietzky ossietzky was a journalist with die weltbühne a periodical in which he repudiated the german mobilization without compromise ossietzky was arrested already the night of the parliament fire after that he spent five long years of suffering and humiliation as hitler's prisoner in the concentration_camps of papenburg esterwegen in 1946 albert_einstein wrote the following on the subject of ossietzky having been awarded the peace_prize the bestowal of an honour of this magnitude on this simple marture will be forever meriting for the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament the candidature of ossietzky was discussed all over the world one of the contributions in this discussion came from heinrich mann who wrote the following ossi who can no_longer speak or write has still had the good fortune of having the world's conscience emerging for a moment and witnessing on his behalf and the language that was spoken was his name in remembering the award of the nobel peace_prize to ossietzky in 1936 we shall not forget the hard work of the young german refugee willy_brandt in support of ossietzky's candidature when ossietzky was finally elected for the prize he did not let his fears stand in the way imprisoned and marked by death he resisted göring's pressure to renounce the prize when the war reached norway in 1940 willy_brandt as many others was forced to leave the country as hitler germany had deprived willy_brandt of his german citizenship the norwegian_parliament granted him norwegian citizenship while he was a refugee in sweden in sweden willy_brandt continued his work for democracy in germany and for the freedom of norway there is hardly any other norwegian journalist who has written so many articles and so many books on norway's struggle for freedom as willy_brandt among the many publications i can mention but a few the war in norway norway continues its struggles the struggle of the university of oslo norway's way to freedom and many many more articles and lectures to create the necessary understanding in sweden for the struggle for freedom in the occupied norway during the first years of the war our country is deeply indebted to willy_brandt for his deeds during these evil years with the coming of peace in the spring of 1945 willy_brandt was offered prominent positions in norway and germany as well as in other countries after one year as a norwegian press attaché in berlin he chose to make his living in his native country a country in ruins suffering from total defeat with germany at a zero position economically and morally willy_brandt wanted to be part of the building of a democratic germany together with other freedom loving people what we remember best of willy_brandt's work in germany during the first post war years is his courageous work for the freedom of berlin and norway's and other countries concern for berlin's struggle for freedom might be related to a feeling that defeat for berlin would also mean defeat for peace in europe willy_brandt wrote in his book my way to berlin if we had given up berlin world peace would be even more fragile today keeping the peace is essential but it is not less important to secure freedom and contribute to the breakthrough of justice the self control and the courage which i suspect was often a courage of despair that willy_brandt displayed in critical situations when he was the mayor of berlin a city under great political pressure and great unrest and with the erection of the wall in 1961 saved berlin from the risk of a catastrophy of great dimensions after berlin willy_brandt left for bonn and the bundestag parliament he became the leader of the social democratic party and was the party's candidate for chancellor in 1961 1965 and 1969 in 1966 the political situation in germany led to a coalition government between the two major parties the christian democrats and the social democrats in this government willy_brandt served as foreign_secretary and vice chancellor and it is from this new and wider political perspective that he is able to take the international initiatives on_behalf of his government that led towards the present hope of international détente this possibility of renewal and a more distinct formulation of germany's foreign_policy goals became of course even greater in 1969 when brandt was made federal chancellor it was the beginning of a new chapter in brandt's life and in the history of germany as is well_known the 1969 election lead to a new coalition government in germany this time between the social democrats and the free democrats the declaration of this new government with brandt as chancellor and walter scheel as foreign_secretary made it clear that the government wanted to pursue a policy characterized by continuity as well as by renewal on the area of foreign_policy this resulted in an intensification of the previously pursued policy as well as in new signals when the federal_republic was formed in 1949 konrad adenauer became its first chancellor adenauer stated in his first government declaration that west germany belonged with the west european countries from this evaluation of the international situation the federal_republic sought organized economic and military co_operation with western europe also many west european countries had expressed their will to look to the future rather_than to the past to reach out across the narrow and dangerous boundaries of nationalism in order to build a peaceful co existence that would also include germany it was this policy of peace that helped germany out of its isolation and the associated dangers and that led to the rome treaty and the birth of the european community eec in 1958 as head of government willy_brandt has not deviated from the principles of extending west european co_operation on the contrary he has added a new dimension to it by stressing that a strong and co operating western europe is a prerequisite to achieve a change from confrontation to co_operation between eastern_europe and western europe as is well_known there was a stagnation within the european community from the beginning of the sixties when it came to its efforts of enlarging the community at the eec summit meeting in the hague in 1969 brandt submitted a declaration of enlargement of the community which has been of great importance this initiative by germany was the starting_point for renewed negotiations about enlargement of the eec on november 6 1970 the chancellor said the following with reference to germany's contribution to the summit meeting in the hague in the german bundestag the federal_republic of germany has been a mainstay in the efforts to strengthen and increase west european unity and co_operation and the new progress that is being made can again be related to german initiatives on october 28 1969 at the government declaration parliamentary debate brandt said the following the north atlantic treaty organization which has stood the test for twenty_years is the organization that vouches for our security also in the future the firm unity of the treaty is a prerequisite for solidary efforts for détente in europe based_on the strength and unity of west european economic and political co_operation and with the support of the 15 nato member countries willy_brandt's government now took up a more active policy of détente towards the soviet_union and other east european countries the nobel_committee expressed the following in its reflection to award willy_brandt the peace_prize the nobel_committee has placed importance on the concrete initiatives that can lead to such a détente that willy_brandt took when he was foreign_secretary of the federal_republic of germany from 1966 and when he was its chancellor from 1969 these concrete initiatives are specified in 4 clauses in the government declaration of october 28 1969 clause 1 deals with efforts to be taken to deepen and enlarge the european economic community and strengthen the political co_operation within it clause 2 speaks of a non_violence agreement with the soviet_union clause 3 expresses the will to initiate talks with poland with a view to normalizing the relations with this country clause 4 contains a declaration that the government wishes to sign a non_proliferation treaty the government signed a non_proliferation treaty already during its first year with this first step brandt's government paved the way for a meaningful dialogue between east and west with his expeditious mode of action he contributed to the clarity of and the trust in the federal republic's will for détente a policy of détente to successfully bring the peoples of europe together requires both parties to step out of the trenches of the cold_war brandt wrote in a book entitled after the victory published in stockholm 1944 the day will come when the absolute hatred of war will be forgotten on this day there will be a europe for all europeans brandt's east european policy is an attempt to bury hatred and seek reconciliation across the mass graves of the war how important it was for him personally to carry_out this task of reconciliation is demonstrated by his kneeling by the jewish memorial in the former ghetto of warsaw the first concrete result of brandt's efforts for relaxation in germany's relations with the soviet_union was the signing of a non_violence agreement in moscow on august 12 1970 in this agreement it is established that all controversal issues shall be solved in a peaceful manner and that peace only can be secured if both countries refrain from violating each other's borders both countries declared that they do not have territorial claims on other countries and that they would respect the integrity of all other countries within their present boundaries the agreement also contained mutual wishes for more economic technical and cultural co_operation the federal_republic also confirmed in a letter from foreign_secretary walter scheel to foreign_secretary gromyko that the agreement did not conflict with the political objectives of the federal_republic of germany which were to act for a peaceful order in europe that would make it possible for the german peoples to reunite through the right of self determination at the signing of this agreement willy_brandt made a televised speech to the german people in which he referred to the government declaration our national interests do not allow us to stand between east and west our country needs west european co_operation and understanding as well as the understanding of eastern_europe the german people needs peace in the full sense of the word also with the soviet_union and all peoples of eastern_europe and he continued this has been and is our guiding rule and it is this work for peace which is served by the agreement on december 7 1970 shortly after the signing of the moscow agreement an agreement for normalizing the relations with poland was signed the most_important part of this agreement was the federal republic's recognition of the western border of poland i.e the oder neisse line furthermore it was agreed that the two countries would have no territorial claims on each_other a german wish that people of german descent who lived in poland would be able to leave poland at their own discretion was not dealt with in the agreement but nevertheless accepted in a speech made in warsaw to the german people brandt said among other_things i_am well aware of the fact that this is a difficult journey it will be of importance for a future in peace the warsaw agreement shall be the symbolic end of sufferings and sacrifices of an evil past it shall build a bridge between countries and peoples it shall open a way that leads to the reunion of families that live apart and to borders that separate less_than before a condition by the government of the federal_republic for submitting the two agreements to the parliament for ratification was however that an agreement be made between the four occupying powers to secure the connection of west_berlin to the federal_republic of germany this condition seems to have been fulfilled by the four power agreement that was made on september 3 of this year in this general agreement the four occupying powers agree to refrain from threats to use instruments of force in berlin and to solve all problems in a peaceful manner movements between west_berlin and the federal_republic have been facilitated and the possibilities for the inhabitants of west_berlin to travel to east berlin and the ddr are greater the fact that the inhabitants of west_berlin will be able to visit their families behind the wall is from a humane point of view of course one of the most_important achievements the agreements put a final end to an era where west_berlin was the place for confrontations between east and west confrontations that have caused political crises and near war conditions brandt made the following statement when interviewed by die zeit in november this year of course the berlin agreements cannot solve all long_term problems for the city this will only be possible when we have come substantially closer to a european peace order the wall is still there but it is less impenetrable it is the four problem areas that i have tried to outline here that are the essence of willy_brandt's policy of co_operation and détente this policy of his might pave the way for further initiatives to reduce tension in europe willy_brandt himself mentions in an interview that there is hope for a mutual reduction in military forces as well as for de escalation of armament in europe especially in central europe let_us hope that a development in this direction in europe will lay the foundations for a global order of peace last year the soviet russian author and winner of the nobel prize in literature alexander solzjenitsyn sent a letter to the swedish academy for the prize award ceremonies in which he says however i cannot disregard the fact that the award of the nobel peace_prize takes place on the human_rights day the nobel prize_winners cannot avoid the responsibility of this coincidence willy_brandt's peace plan for europe is the evidence that such responsibility exists his work for peace means possibilities for peoples of all countries to lead a dignified life without fear what people want is to live in a europe without separating walls and borders guarded by rockets a europe where using the words of henrik wergeland the branch of a rose bush is enough to designate a border willy_brandt's peace work has had a difficult starting_point we have experienced one of the most barbaric wars in history we are in the midst of a devastating war in southeast asia peoples of the middle_east are arming themselves against each_other there are preparations for war in india and pakistan where thousands of children already are dying of hunger and millions of hands are clasped in prayer for a meal the only thing in abundance in these impoverished countries seems to be weapons this brings to mind the following words by franklin roosevelt what we need more_than an end to wars is an end to the beginning of all wars i see a hope for the future in giving this_year's peace_prize to an active politician on the international arena as such he has a greater responsibility as well as greater possibilities of making a contribution that can subsequently bear the longed for fruits of peace we can see for ourselves that willy_brandt's policy of peace has brought thaw to the cold political climate and this instills hopes for a new kind of peace for the frozen earth of europe achieving peace and keeping it is not a simple one time operation plenty of sceptics and kill joys will remind us about that the struggle for peace is a continuous process it is a project that has to be worked at every day over and over again but people cannot live without hope and belief therefore we shall hope and therefore we shall believe that willy_brandt's gesture of reconciliation across the borders of old enemies will be interpreted in the spirit it was made if these hopes are fulfilled willy_brandt will live on in our history as the great peace and reconciliation chancellor of germany your_majesty your_royal highnesses_ladies and gentlemen on january 23 of this year a ceasefire agreement was concluded between the united_states of america and the vietnamese democratic republic at its meeting on october 16 the nobel_committee of the norwegian_storting decided to award the peace_prize for 1973 to henry_kissinger and le duc tho the two chief negotiators who succeeded in arranging the ceasefire after negotiating for nearly four years for many long and bitter years the civilian population of vietnam and the fighting troops engaged on both_sides had borne the sufferings and privations of war this was a war that concerned not only vietnam and its people it was a war moreover that had poisoned the atmosphere in countries and between countries all over the world never since the conclusion of the second_world war have the people of vietnam enjoyed unbroken peace at the conclusion of the world war france was faced in vietnam with a powerfully armed resistance movement under communist leadership attempts to negotiate a solution to the problem of establishing and recognising an independent vietnamese state proved unsuccessful open war_broke out although the number of french troops involved amounted to close on 400,000 france failed to crush the opposition after the defeat of france at dien bien phu in 1954 a ceasefire agreement was concluded at geneva a military line of demarcation was drawn at the 17th parallel the intention was for the country subsequently to be unified after free elections had been held this however was not to be the new government in south_vietnam maintained that free elections could not be carried_out under the communist regime in the north as a result two states emerged on the soil of vietnam between 1954 and 1960 the two vietnamese states took shape a communist state in the north and a non communist one in the south in south_vietnam a guerilla movement opposed to the government in power came into being in the course of 1960 its activities increased at the end of that year a joint organisation and command was established in the national liberation movement the fln it was acclaimed in north vietnam and the south vietnamese government maintained that the fln was operating under north vienamese control during the years that followed the south vietnamese government failed to hold in check the increasing activities and influence of the fln it was also clear that attempts to create an effective administration and government in south_vietnam had failed in 1964 decisions were made that resulted in the united_states during the next few years committing american armed_forces to acts of war on asian soil these troops were at that time engaged both in a civil war in south_vietnam and in a war between the two vietnamese states this took the form of a large scale commitment of american forces on south vietnamese soil as well as air attacks on targets in north vietnam and on supply lines through laos and cambodia for north vietnamese troops in march 1969 the number of american soldiers in vietnam reached maximum figures of 541,500 men the escalation of the american commitment was matched by a corresponding increase in north vietnamese forces in south_vietnam the world today is aware of the misery that the war has inflicted on the people of vietnam the mechanical inhumanity of modern warfare has gone hand in hand with the horrors of civil war there is no need here to repeat the uncertain but chilling figures of the victims of this war the dead and wounded the orphans prisoners of war deportees and homeless multitudes fleeing from the theatre of war the war proved a nightmare not only to the people of vietnam but to the entire world in 1969 the systematic withdrawal of american forces from vietnam commenced by december 1972 out of a one time total of half a million only 27,000 were still left but the war continued with major offensives in south_vietnam and fresh aerial attacks on north vietnam the latter as late as in december of last year nevertheless the negotiations for a ceasefire and peace in vietnam initiated in paris in 1969 only suffered minor interruptions finally on january 23 of this year the united_states negotiator henry_kissinger and the north vietnam negotiator le duc tho arrived at a ceasefire agreement which they were able to sign on january 27 the nobel_committee of the norwegian_storting was fully aware that a ceasefire and not a peace agreement was involved they realised that peace has not yet come to vietnam and that the sufferings of the population of vietnam are not at an end they were also aware that events in vietnam may yet endanger the détente in the world the ceasefire agreement was only the first but a tremendously important step on the laborious road to full peace in vietnam it is our hope that the two chief negotiators and statesmen who have been awarded the peace_prize this year will show the same understanding of the purpose and intention of the award as that expressed by chancellor willy_brandt in his speech here in this festival hall when he received the peace_prize for 1971 nobel's peace_prize is the highest honour but at the same_time the one that imposes the greatest obligations that can be bestowed on any man bearing political responsibility in his letter of november 2 to the nobel_committee henry_kissinger expresses his deep sense of this obligation in the letter he writes among other_things i_am deeply moved by the award of the nobel peace_prize which i regard as the highest honor one could hope to achieve in the pursuit of peace on this earth when i consider the list of those_who have been so honored before me i can only accept this award with humility the people of the united_states and indeed of the whole world share the hope expressed by the nobel peace_prize committee that all parties to this conflict will feel morally responsible for turning the ceasefire in vietnam into a lasting peace for the suffering peoples of indochina certainly my government for its part intends to continue to conduct its policies in such a way as to turn this hope into reality i feel convinced that all right minded people will share the nobel_committee's pleasure at this statement of dr kissinger the nobel peace_prize is often awarded to persons who do not have direct responsibility or share in the responsibility for the policy of governments for peace or war among nations it has been awarded to individuals and to organisations promoting cooperation between nations in the endeavour to create a better world a world without hunger a world of justice for workers a world in which human_rights are respected everywhere a world without racial_discrimination and racial antagonism and the prize has been awarded to persons filled with the dream of a world in which war is inconceivable but nobel's peace_prize has also been awarded to persons exercising political responsibility and heavily committed to the confusing maelstrom of events they were awarded the peace_prize because in the course of their activities they had indicated the road that should be followed no one could know whether this road would be followed but they had lit a torch on the long and difficult road to peace among men they were awarded the peace_prize because within the framework of the politically possible they championed a peace which though it might not be perfect was nevertheless a step along this road in the present day situation it might be useful to go right back to 1950 when the prize was awarded to ralph_bunche the united_nations representative in palestine for his contribution in negotiating a ceasefire between israel and the arab_states on three occasions since the days of ralph_bunche in 1956 in 1967 and now once_again in 1973 the ceasefire has been superseded by open war in the middle_east the road he indicated by his own actions was not followed today finally after the fourth war in the middle_east there are prospects that the new ceasefire as bunche had hoped could form the basis of a peace which would provide lasting security to all the people living in this part of the world in 1971 the prize was awarded to a responsible statesman chancellor willy_brandt for his personal contribution to a détente and to a policy of cooperation in europe he had succeeded in convincing the majority of the german people that the basis for a policy of peace and negotiation in europe must be a recognition of the actual power relationship in europe and in this way of the fact that two german states are now in existence on german soil this was not a perfect solution but as a responsible statesman and the leader of a nation in the heart of europe willy_brandt opted for the peace policy which was the only possible one in awarding the prize in 1973 as well to two responsible politicians at the centre of events the nobel_committee of the norwegian_storting emphasises its belief that the approach to a solution of the many controversies that have led to or may lead to war must be via negotiations not through total war aiming at total victory the two negotiators who were awarded the prize represent widely differing systems one an essentially western system such as the one in which our own storting functions the other a communist system we are under no illusion that the differences between systems and ideologies can be ignored but the nobel_committee has been anxious to emphasise that in a world yearning for peace no one can assume the right to force his particular system on others by armed might nations with different systems of government must be able to live together in peace and solve their controversies by negotiation le duc tho has informed the committee that at present he is not in a position to be able to accept the prize giving as his reason the present situation in vietnam in accordance_with current regulations the committee has been able to withhold the prize until october 1 1974 it hopes that conditions in vietnam will develop in accordance_with the aims of the ceasefire concluded on january 23 and this will make it possible for him to accept the prize this year henry_kissinger was appointed secretary of state in the united_states in his letter to the committee he writes as follows i greatly regret that because of the press of business in a world beset by recurrent crisis i shall be unable to come to oslo on december_10 for the award_ceremony i have accordingly designated ambassador byrne to represent me on that occasion however i would hope and consider it a privilege should you so wish to visit oslo at a future appropriate date to deliver the lecture which i understand is customarily given by laureates of the nobel peace_prize the committee is of course aware of dr kissinger's burden of work this autumn nevertheless they profoundly regret that he was unable to come here_today to receive the prize in person we are looking forward to hearing his lecture at a later date henry a kissinger was born in germany in 1923 of jewish parents in 1938 his family escaped to the united_states his father who had been a teacher worked in an office in new_york henry_kissinger was called up for military service in 1943 and became an american citizen he took_part in the concluding military operations in europe and was responsible for the administration of a small south german town administered by the occupying allied powers in 1946 he won a scholarship for study at harvard university in 1954 he received his doctor's degree for a thesis on the european peace settlement after the napoleonic wars in the 1950s he conducted a study group at the council of foreign relations in new_york this group analysed the relations of the usa to the soviet_union in particular problems of military security in the nuclear age in 1957 he returned to harvard where he was appointed professor in 1962 in the 1950s and likewise in the 1960s he wrote a great_deal on various political subjects he also carried_out research projects for president eisenhower and president kennedy without associating himself with any party he also helped to draw up nelson a rockefeller's programme during the presidential election of 1968 after 1968 he worked in an advisory capacity for president nixon from january 1969 he was to play a central role as advisor to the president on questions of national security in 1973 he was appointed secretary of state in all dr kissinger's writing we catch sight of a basic attitude which made him particularly suited to the role he was destined to play in 1969 this attitude emerges already in local german accounts of his conduct as an american administrative officer in 1945 46 people still remember the way in which this young german jewish emigré who returned to the land of his birth seven years later wearing an american uniform and seventeen of whose relations had been murdered under the nazis made it clear at once we have not come to take our revenge this attitude reveals an early developed concept of the relations_between people and nations an attitude which tolerated no fanaticism not even in a young man of german jewish blood not even in his dealings with a people that had allowed fanatics to plunge them into a moral abyss in his doctoral thesis kissinger deals with the protracted period of peace that reigned in europe after 1814 a period that lasted with infrequent warlike interruptions for a hundred years right up to 1914 in dealing with this period many historians emphasise exclusively the military balance of power no single great power was militarily strong_enough to endeavour to dominate the whole of europe as napoleon had done before 1814 and germany was to do after 1914 kissinger on the other_hand places a great_deal of emphasis on the fact that peace was bound up with an international order based_on universally accepted principles for the behaviour of states in their relations to one another in those days too political systems differed widely and the great_powers had a great many conflicting_interests but by and large they respected these principles and rules and on this basis they tried to prevent differences of systems and interests leading to war it was therefore quite natural that kissinger should place very great emphasis on diplomacy as a factor for the promotion of peace as well diplomacy both as a profession and as an art the overriding idea in kissinger's views on foreign_policy is that peace must be based_on rules to which all states at any_rate the great_powers adhere in their conduct it is not sufficient for one single state or a number of states to do so on the contrary a dangerous situation may arise if some states desire peace at any price and fail to ensure that other states too adhere to the rules in his doctoral thesis he expressed this as follows whenever peace conceived as the avoidance of war has been the primary objective of a power or a group of powers the international system has been at the mercy of the most ruthless member of the international community a policy of this kind could lead to war and the most frightening example was the munich agreement of 1938 in which the western powers sacrificed czechoslovakia to hitler there were people who believed that as the result of this deal peace would be secured for our lifetime at the time there was a failure to understand that hitler entirely ignored all the rules of the game in international relations it goes without saying that in the case of a man with kissinger's background the experiences of the 1930s were bound to set their mark on his thinking whenever political extremists acquired power in a state they were dangerous in his opinion because they were unwilling to accept any permanent rules in relationships between states for this reason he looked with profound misgiving at the communist governments and this was to affect his thinking with regard to the situation in the west and its security in the 1950s at the same_time however he was aware at an earlier stage than most people of the dangers to mankind that the new atomic arms involved he was concerned with the problem of how the united_states and western europe would be able to defend themselves without having recourse to supremely absurd means strategic atomic arms he pinned his hopes on the thought that in the age of atomic arms all great_powers must realise that their most_important task is to prevent the outbreak of nuclear warfare it was of vital importance to them to realise this no matter what political systems and ideologies they represented but recognition of this fact would also of necessity compel them to develop a new relationship to one another a new system based_on universally accepted rules as had been the case in europe prior to 1914 this was kissinger's working hypothesis the basis of his great experiment in foreign_policy in a world of this kind the united_states should not in his opinion try to play the role of world policeman the other powers first and foremost the soviet_union and china should be invited to join in as equal partners enjoying the same rights in this policy and with the same responsibility for peace in the world kissinger is no technocrat when he set out on his journeys to moscow and peking after 1969 he had no cut and dried solutions to the problems devised at his desk in washington he approached these problems with his working hypothesis his message his queries this great experiment indicates a way out of the world situation created by the second_world war and the cold_war the policy kissinger has attempted to put into effect since 1969 is closely bound up with the ideas he had arrived at long before 1969 no one is in any doubt as to his personal contribution to the policy of détente in a recent interview he made it quite clear that it is precisely because they have conflicting_interests and different systems and ideologies that it has become imperative to seek a détente in the relationship_between the great_powers this is why it is so important to reduce the danger of nuclear warfare the détente provides governments with opportunities to negotiate and to act swiftly when required as well as the opportunity to show moderation this was emphasised in connection with the crisis in the middle_east this_year's nobel prize_winner has been called a realist he cautions against the markedly ideological and emotionally conditioned approach in foreign_policy in his own_country as well this realism of his is deeply rooted in a considered conviction a fundamental ethical attitude which has remained unshaken through changing times and situations his preoccupation has been the responsibility of the statesman in an imperfect and multifarious world full of danger now he himself bears the burden of such responsibility in the years that lie_ahead we shall know how far his experiment will take us on the road to a safer world but this depends not only on henry_kissinger nor only on the united_states one of the touchstones in the conflict is the middle_east another touchstone is the conflict in vietnam here the result depends on all parties involved in the conflict both the states in the actual area of conflict and the superpowers who are involved in our part of the world too in europe negotiations are at present going on for a détente security and cooperation within the global framework which this great experiment has provided today a handful of great statesmen are sitting down at the conference table deciding the question of war and peace in the world but the millions of people whose fate is at stake cannot allow the politicians to carry the burdens and responsibility alone by means of an active and positive world opinion we must make our contribution to the fulfilment of our hopes for peace irrespective of national_boundaries the peoples of this world and not least the peace organisations must speak with one voice the voice of peace so loudly that the politicians are forced to listen there are people today who cynically shrug their shoulders at negotiated agreements this is an amoral nay a dangerous attitude ceasefire agreements between states must not be called in question they must not be interpreted merely as paper resolutions but as a moral and inviable obligation between the states that have signed them only with an honest approach of this kind to the intentions and obligations of international agreements can they help us along the road to peace the peace at which we must aim must not be limited merely to the avoidance of military conflict real peace in the world can only mean that all of us in every country should make it possible for people irrespective of race religion ideology or nationality to live a life free from fear free from violence free from terrorism a life in which the fundamental human_rights are the secure and imperishable possession of every_single human being your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen a few years before he drew up his last will and testament alfred_nobel observed in a letter to bertha_von suttner that his dynamite factories would be able to bring wars to an end a great_deal more rapidly than peace congresses would ever succeed in doing the day two armies can destroy one another in the course of a second there will be hope that all civilised nations will demobilise their forces and refrain from waging war thus as far back as the mid 1890s alfred_nobel foresaw a kind of total retaliation after the first atom_bomb had been tried out in new mexico in july 1945 the scientists who had carried_out the experiment believed that the world was faced with a new opportunity of putting an end to all wars armed with a weapon of this kind humanity had reached a threshold if this threshold were crossed both aggressor and defender would be doomed to destruction total annihilation was the alternative to peace amid the awful terror which compelled nuclear physicists too to urge the world to come to its senses a hope was born that disarmament and peace would have a chance inevitably in a world rent by internal dissension world peace was made dependent on the establishment of a fearsome balance of terror between east and west even on the brink of disaster wars could not be brought to an end the old pattern was maintained in a period we have erroneously called the post war period as well lives are being destroyed property laid waste minds darkened and fear fermented in every corner of the world maybe we have gradually come to know more about the causes of war and discord maybe we have gradually realised our share of responsibility too for tragedies enacted far from our own borders it is comfort of a kind to believe this but we have not made any appreciable progress in introducing measures to remove these causes despite all our efforts on a day such as this with the award of the nobel peace_prize there are nevertheless good grounds for mentioning some of the favourable aspects of the development in recent_years both multilateral and bilateral negotiations have been initiated with a view to promoting détente and practical cooperation we are living in an era in which dialogue has largely replaced confrontation and isolation only a few years_ago a negotiating pattern of this kind of which we can now observe the contours would have been considered entirely utopian the whole world pins its hopes and expectations on this exchange of views and ideas i can see a ray of hope in the fact that a strong and vital body of public_opinion all over the world rejects violence and the abuse of power we are witnessing a world wide wave of opinion do not be misled into attributing this to war weariness because frequently men and women who have no personal experience of war are in the forefront of this wave call it rather a genuine belief in peace the climate of opinion of which i_am speaking does_not restrict its efforts to combating war alone in large measure attention is drawn to social political and economic oppression and this is just and right the struggle_against injustice is a blow struck in the cause of peace the injustice inflicted on others strikes every one of us as fellow humans one of the great torchbearers of our age in the struggle for human_rights the nobel prize_winner alexander solzhenitsyn has said that our aim must be to eliminate from mankind the very idea that anyone is allowed to use force against justice law and mutual agreements at no time surely has this idea been more accepted and understood in ever widening circles throughout the world than precisely in our own age this is a hopeful sign in a world full of terrifying future prospects no statesman no government will be in a position to act with impunity without taking this body of opinion into account the nobel_committee of the norwegian_storting is charged with the onerous task of selecting persons or institutions that merit the award of the year's peace_prize it could hardly be expected that the decisions of the committee would not give rise to discussion this has been the case ever_since the first award was made over seventy years_ago this eloquently proves how difficult it is to define the concept of peace on previous occasions of this nature the nobel_committee has selected laureates whose efforts on_behalf of peace have covered a great many varied fields they have included statesmen negotiating round the conference table defenders of human_rights experts on international_law rebels humanists idealists pragmaticists dreamers they have all been controversial figures on this occasion both laureates are from countries that have previously not produced winners of the nobel peace_prize in fact eisaku_sato is at the same_time the first asiatic who has received this prize he comes before us today as a representative of the only nation that has experienced the unspeakable horrors of nuclear warfare this terrible experience has left a deep imprint on the japanese nation but for the rest of us too names such as hiroshima and nagasaki are permanent symbols of something that we must all strive to prevent for all future time seán_mac bride is a citizen of a country that for many years has been the scene of bitter grievous conflict his experience has acted as a spur urging him on in his many and varied efforts to promote international cooperation each of these two peace_prize winners represents different aspects of peace work with the aid of the difficult art of politics and negotiation they have endeavoured by practical means to promote their ideals the goals they have reached must constantly be achieved afresh since the peace and the justice that the world so sorely need are constantly threatened eisaku_sato was prime_minister of japan for nearly eight years from november 1964 to june 1972 a longer span than any of his predecessors in all democracies the position of head of government is subject to attack from many angles and sato was frequently the object of violent criticism upon assuming the post of prime_minister sato declared that he would aim to secure for japan an influence in international politics consistent with the country's status as a major economic power observers in other countries had every reason to watch how this programme would be implemented would japan in her more active foreign_policy revert to a nationalistic approach there were many who feared this increased self assurance resulting from economic strength considerations of national prestige and domestic policy might well have dominated in japan as has been the case with other great_powers it soon became clear that japan would pursue a foreign_policy that aimed_at promoting friendship with other countries after the war many nations still had vivid memories of an aggressive and militaristic japan not least in countries that had experienced japanese occupation the feeling of distrust was considerable with a sense of great expectation the world followed the work of appeasement on which japan had embarked the basis of japan's foreign_policy and security policy was conditioned by the obligations imposed on the country after the second_world war the constitution japan adopted in 1947 had expressly stated that the japanese people renounced rights that had previously been regarded as essential to an independent nation war and the threat or use of force are renounced as means of deciding conflicts with other nations this is a unique provision in a country's constitution this principle was established by the american occupation authorities and was markedly influenced by this fact in japan militarism was crushed in 1945 and strong pacifist tendencies made their influence felt among the people as head of government sato frequently recalled that the anti war provision in the constitution must serve as a basis for the country's policy he emphasised three principles upon which his government would base itself as far as nuclear_arms were concerned never to produce arms of this nature never to own them and never to introduce them into japan the japanese people have supported this peace policy laid_down by sato reacting very forcefully to any indication that developments might proceed in another direction from time to time it has been said that the japanese people have developed an allergy against nuclear_arms an allergy of this kind is a healthy sign and other countries might well learn a lesson from this whenever eisaku_sato in his role of prime_minister emphasised as he did on many occasions that japan would only pursue its goals by peaceful_means he undoubtedly expressed an opinion that had the overwhelming support of the great majority of his people shortly after sato had taken office as prime_minister he set out to improve relations with south_korea a friendship pact was signed between the two countries and ratified in the autumn of 1965 diplomatic relations were also immediately established between the two countries this agreement proved the prelude to a systematic plan for improving relations_between japan and a number of other states in the pacific area in the autumn of 1967 sato set off on a protracted tour in the course of which he visited among other countries burma malaysia singapore thailand laos indonesia australia new zealand the philippines and south_vietnam the objects of his journey were to strengthen friendly relations stimulate trade and inaugurate discussions with a view to promoting political cooperation and a more active cultural exchange it is widely accepted that increased trade is one of the best ways of promoting international understanding once a start is made in this practical field and mutual interests are discovered the road will be clear for increased contact in other spheres as well this approach as we all know has played a major role in east west relations in recent_years in asia japan under the leadership of sato set out to improve trade relations increase aid to developing_countries and encourage a greater measure of regional cooperation japan was responsible for initiating a ministerial conference for economic development in south east asia as well as actively promoting measures to ensure the realisation of the international development bank for asia japan has herself been among the major contributors to this bank on the assumption that the country carries a special responsibility for the promotion of peace in this area in sato's opinion an important factor in this respect was that countries would be in a better position to exploit their material and cultural resources the japanese friendship policy was faced with a fundamental difficulty from the very start inter_alia because japan's close treaty relations with the usa were criticised in certain quarters particularly during the vietnam war not only did japan refrain from any military participation in vietnam but eisaku_sato urged the belligerents to come together without imposing conditions of any kind in order to discuss a truce and peace war would never solve the political problems sato declared in his speech to the japanese national assembly in july 1965 an attempt on the part of the japanese government to investigate the possibilities for a peace initiative proved abortive in the spring of 1966 as head of government it fell to sato's lot to maintain a balance between conflicting_interests while adhering to the treaty with the usa he also demanded greater independence it was particularly important for the japanese people to reach agreement with the united_states on the return of the groups of islands that the usa had occupied since the end of the second_world war after five_years of ceaseless endeavour sato succeeded in coming to an arrangement whereby japan was given sovereignty over okinawa and the ogasawara islands his success in doing so helped to remove a serious source of friction in relations_between the two countries at the same_time it also helped to strengthen stability throughout this area and to convince the japanese people that their foreign political aims could best be achieved through the medium of negotiation and not by aggressive acts or threats it was of particular importance to japan that the agreement ensured that no nuclear_arms would be stationed on the american bases on okinawa the agreement when it was negotiated in 1951 could be hailed as a step in the direction of fulfilling the japanese wish to safeguard its national security both the security agreement and the actual peace pact presupposed that japan would have the right to self defence and the right to participate in collective security compacts in accordance_with the united_nations charter it is on this basis that japan's defence system is founded it is generally accepted that during the years that have subsequently elapsed japan has shown considerable restraint in this field no great power has shown a corresponding degree of moderation in fact a great many small countries maintain military forces that are very much larger and stronger than the japanese no single politician in japan deserves the sole credit for this the japanese people's opposition to any form of military resurgence is so strong that no other policy would have been feasible in relations with the soviet_union too marked improvements were registered during sato's term of office no peace agreement was concluded with the russians because the latter insisted on the right to the islands in the north kurils a claim no japanese government could accept but during sato's term of office cooperation was continued in the sphere of foreign_policy and trade not least after an exchange of visits by the foreign ministers of the two countries no diplomatic relations were established between the chinese people's republic and japan in common with a great many other countries the japanese government pursued a policy which entailed recognition of formosa in spite of this several important points of contact were established between tokyo and peking in connection with the bandung conference in april 1965 prime_minister sato's special envoy had a conversation with prime_minister chou en lai in which the japanese desire for closer contact_with the people's republic was expressed despite political obstacles trade between the two countries increased and the outside world noted inter_alia that japanese journalists were allowed to work in peking during the cultural revolution whereas journalists from most other countries were obliged to leave the people's republic on a number of occasions sato spoke of the need to hold the door to peking open however as long as japan maintained recognition of the regime in formosa it was impossible to establish diplomatic relations with peking nevertheless it was of importance to the international atmosphere that relations_between the two states should all this time have been marked by a sense of restraint in several disputes in asia particularly in the conflict between india and pakistan and that between malaysia and indonesia sato intervened personally in order to persuade the parties involved to settle their differences the payment of considerable sums by way of compensation to countries that had suffered under the japanese occupation was another factor that contributed greatly to improving relations with other countries during sato's ministry long standing differences were mitigated and new mutual interests were created the good neighbour policy of which sato was the chief exponent was well received in large areas of asia that the economic influence of the japanese should have been the source of dispute and have encountered resistance in no way alters the overall impression in awarding the peace_prize for 1974 to eisaku_sato the nobel_committee wishes to emphasise the important role the japanese people have played in promoting close and friendly cooperation with other nations japan's attitude has helped to strengthen peace in east asia and to lay the foundation for economic_growth and progress for many countries by countering the tendency towards a nationalistic policy in japan after the war by constantly emphasising the need for international cooperation and understanding by playing the role of arbitrator and thus helping to iron out differences sato has made a major contribution to peace the nobel_committee has attached considerable importance to the statements eisaku_sato has made in which he has affirmed his determination to adhere to his doctrine that japan shall never own produce or acquire nuclear_arms at a time of increasing risk that more and more nations will acquire weapons of this kind it is important that japan under sato's leadership signed a pact on the non_proliferation of nuclear_arms in february 1970 at that time sato declared that it was in conformity with japan's national aims to prevent arms of this kind being acquired by more states the aim was to ease international tension establish friendly relations with every country and help to set_up international contacts that would promote the cause of peace it was sato's hope that the non_proliferation agreement would be followed up by effective measures resulting in a reduction of the number of nuclear_arms in the world he also emphasised the importance of ensuring that this pact should be the prelude to practical progress in promoting general disarmament the non_proliferation agreement has as yet not been ratified by japan although the government that succeeded sato's confirmed as recently as in the meeting of the united_nations general_assembly this year that it would work to achieve this the responsibility for future decisions is not vested in any one individual i should like to emphasise that the attitude of the japanese people may well prove decisive in shaping future developments it is the hope of the nobel_committee that this_year's award will be interpreted as an encouragement to all who work to ensure that the non_proliferation agreement will receive the widest possible support peace loving people throughout the world cherish the hope that the future development of asia will proceed without the fear of war and the resort to force may the hope that the pacific ocean will become a real ocean of peace be realised in this development japan's role is of decisive_importance the other peace_prize winner this year is the irishman seán_mac bride who was born in paris on january 26 1904 as a young man he witnessed the irish struggle for independence with all its horrors this experience was in many ways to prove an abiding influence after working as a journalist for a number of years he studied law and qualified to practise in 1937 this enabled him to work more effectively for the legal rights of persecuted individuals after the second_world war he entered the irish national assembly the dail eireann of which he was a member from 1947 to 1958 from 1948 to 1951 he was ireland's foreign_minister this was at a time when the council of europe was drafting the european convention on human_rights the object of this work was to secure the acceptance of a convention in which human_rights would for the first time be accorded universal international protection it was a great day in european history when the convention was finally signed by the foreign ministers of member states in rome on november 4 1950 mac_bride played a dominant role in piloting this convention through to a successful conclusion from now on he was to devote his entire life to the work of promoting greater respect for human_rights not only in west europe but throughout the world in speeches and in articles he urged the authorities of every country to negotiate and abide by international agreements guaranteeing the rights of the individual in 1961 he was elected_president of the international board of amnesty_international and for many years he was active as the fearless and vigorous head of this organisation visiting a great many countries to plead the cause of persecuted men and women taking up the cudgels against torture and urging a sense of greater humanity and neighbourly love his field of activity covered asia africa and america his most_important standby in this campaign was his own energy and enthusiasm and the support he received from countless voluntary helpers in many countries he mobilised the conscience of the world in the fight_against injustice the organisation of which he was the leader gradually achieved wider recognition and greater influence with unflagging zeal he tackled new and fresh tasks mac_bride himself knows that it may take a long time to create the change in the mental climate which in the last resort will provide the only sure guarantee against brutality and arbitrary encroachment on individual liberty but he knows too that there are countless people all over the world who consider themselves bound by their conscience to play their part in this struggle mac_bride has worked both on the ideological and theoretical plane and in the practical sphere he has combined the duties of an organisational leader and a field worker in his work to protect and strengthen human_rights he has achieved a unique position as secretary_general of the international commission of jurists from 1963 to 1970 he was also extremely active this commission was set_up in west_berlin in 1952 its original aims being to record acts of injustice perpetrated in east germany and other east european countries but in time the commission became active in the work of countering violations of human_rights in every country a number of leading jurists from various countries joined the commission norway was represented by terje wold at that time president of the norwegian high court of justice the international commission of jurists which issues several valuable publications has gained great respect for its activities and has maintained close contact_with the united_nations organisations an expression of the esteem in which the commission is held is afforded by the fact that over fifty countries including norway make voluntary contributions to its work seán_mac bride was extremely active as secretary_general and contributed in large measure to enhancing the reputation of the commission he has always emphasised the importance of extending and enforcing the legislative obligations to protect personal rights the individual state must assume obligations of this kind both in its own national legislation and also as an integrated part of international conventions in this way he believes international_law can be developed and extended to provide a guarantee of greater protection for the individual when seán_mac bride participated in a nobel symposium in oslo in september 1967 for example he launched the idea of establishing a convention among the nations of east europe for the protection of human_rights and fundamental freedoms the convention contracted by the member states of the european council was to provide a pattern for a convention of the kind he envisaged by means of regional agreements of this kind he hoped it would be possible to bring_about a real measure of progress in the work of securing such rights he also maintained that a great_deal could be done to ensure that uno's declaration of human_rights became a living reality his ideal would be the establishment of a universal human_rights court with the authority to deal with complaints from individuals who were being subjected to persecution in violation of the universally accepted principles of justice seán_mac bride is of the opinion that no state can claim absolute national sovereignty where human_rights that are universally recognised are concerned rights of this kind are the common property of all mankind the authorities of a country have no right to violate these fundamental individual rights we still have a long way to go before we can reach this goal but mac_bride has emphasised the value of discussing this idea since a process of this kind in itself serves to stimulate afresh our sense of neighbourly love and respect for our fellow human_beings every violation of human_dignity no matter where it occurs is an affront to humanity itself mac bride's active participation in organised peace work of a great many kinds inter_alia in the international peace bureau is widely known and recognised the history of the peace bureau goes right back to the year 1892 it was established as a parent body for the many pacifist associations that existed all over the world and was to play an important part in the setting_up of the league of nations after the second_world war the bureau was reorganised but its objectives remain unchanged viz to promote international understanding and nonviolent solutions to international conflicts the peace bureau was awarded the nobel prize as far back as 1910 over the years mac_bride has occupied various leading positions of trust within this organisation true to his entire attitude to the obligations of international cooperation mac_bride launched at an early stage the idea of establishing a high commissariat in the united_nations for the protection of individual rights this question has been debated for a number of years in uno's committees and in the general_assembly norway is one of the countries that has most actively supported this proposal discussions in uno last year and this year unfortunately reveal that we still have a long way to go before it will be possible to realise this idea in the meantime the work will have to be continued with a view to making steady if slow progress towards this goal during uno's human_rights year in 1968 mac_bride took the initiative in setting_up a joint committee for the various non governmental organisations that championed the cause of human_rights he himself was placed in command of this cooperative venture which proved capable of exercising greater influence with its concerted efforts his skill as a practical negotiator is widely recognised and respected and his powers of conviction and idealism have been in evidence at countless conferences and meetings for over twenty_years mac_bride has occupied a central position in the work of promoting the cause of human_rights he has seen his efforts crowned with success all over the world his exacting message which in its simplest form is akin to the classical love thy neighbour has found an audience that respect for human_rights is growing despite all that we know still remains to be done is due not least to the endeavours of mac_bride in awarding this_year's peace_prize to seán_mac bride the nobel_committee of the norwegian_storting is paying its tribute to an advocate and champion of this important work for peace the committee is convinced that mac bride's numerous friends and supporters all over the world will share with him his pleasure on this day which is actually human_rights day on previous occasions the nobel_committee has had an opportunity of awarding the prize to others who have made a great contribution to the cause of human_rights the name of seán_mac bride takes its place in this circle of peace_prize laureates who have shown humanity the way through the darkness mac_bride is at present facing a new and demanding task as un's high_commissioner for namibia he has personally expressed optimism with regard to the future prospects of this work the world will follow his future work in the service of the united_nations with anticipation and expectation translation your_majesty your_royal highnesses_ladies and gentlemen the nobel_committee of the norwegian_parliament has awarded the nobel peace_prize for 1975 to andrei dmitrievich sakharov in the will and testament that alfred_nobel drew up prior to his death in 1896 he directed that the peace_prize should be awarded to the person who had done the most or the best work for fraternity_between peoples the abolition_or reduction of standing_armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses as is only to be expected the nobel_committee's interpretation of these premises has varied in accordance_with changing attitudes to the concept of peace over the years in the ranks of peace_prize laureates during these last seventy four years examples of this are readily available the committee has rewarded champions of the ideas of international_law champions of social_justice such as léon johaux for humanitarian achievements such as albert_schweitzer for pacifist work such as bertha_von suttner and carl_von ossietzky for the promotion of human_rights such as réne_cassin martin_luther king and albert_lutuli from the very start the decisions made by the committee have frequently been the subject of criticism and debate this need not however mean that they were incorrect the nobel_committee is an independent body independent of any state authority party group or individual the basis of its decisions rests exclusively on the directions and intentions contained in alfred_nobel's will and testament for the committee to allow its work to be influenced in any way by fear or to be dictated by convenience or opportunism would constitute an unforgivable dereliction of its duties this year the nobel_committee has awarded its peace_prize to one of the great champions of human_rights in our age in setting forth its reasons for its present choice the committee states inter_alia sakharov's fearless personal commitment in upholding the fundamental_principles for peace between men is a powerful inspiration for all true work for peace uncompromisingly and with unflagging strength sakharov has fought against the abuse of power and all forms of violation of human_dignity and he has fought no less courageously for the idea of government based_on the rule of law in a convincing manner sakharov has emphasised that man's inviolable rights provide the only safe foundation for genuine and enduring international cooperation in this way in a particularly effective manner working under difficult conditions he has enhanced respect for the values that rally all true peacelovers we were repeatedly told during the great war that raged between 1940 and 1945 that this war was being fought in order to safeguard the human_rights of future generations those_who fought for this noble ideal and the many millions who gave their lives to achieve it won the war on the field of battle but their great goal the enduring establishment of human_dignity was not achieved during the post war years the united_nations has worked energetically and untiringly to draw up and gain universal acceptance for a global declaration and two conventions on fundamental human_rights it has done so in the conviction that these rights and freedoms are absolute imperatives for the maintenance of lasting peace in the world most countries have accepted this line of thought and yet today despite all the sacrifices and efforts that have been made in every part of the world there are millions of people who cannot be said to enjoy the most elementary human_rights there are even regions where people previously enjoyed these rights and where after the conclusion of the last war they forfeited them réne_cassin the architect of the global declaration and one time peace_prize laureate is fully aware of this he has the following comment to make on the present situation the declaration sets up an ideal for us to follow and it lays down guidelines for our actions yet a glance at the world of today is sufficient to show that we still have a long way to go before we can achieve this ideal not a single country even the most advanced can pride itself on fulfilling all the articles of the declaration we witness violations of the right to live murder and massacre are allowed to pass unpunished women are exploited there is widespread famine contempt for freedom of conscience and freedom of speech widespread racial_discrimination all these evils are far too widespread to be overlooked yet this tragic situation must not lead to resignation on the contrary it is a challenge to all responsible people irrespective of national_boundaries to intensify their struggle to establish respect for human_dignity and to rally around the courageous individuals who refuse to bow their necks to the yoke this_year's prizewinner andrei_sakharov was born in moscow in 1921 he studied physics at the university of moscow and attracted considerable attention at an early_age with the publication of a number of scientific treatises during the years from 1948 to 1968 sakharov worked at an institute for nuclear research secret as a member of a team of scientists engaged in the development of nuclear_arms sakharov himself emphasises that his own contribution to the work of this team of scientists was not directed solely to military ends but aimed as well at the harnessing of nuclear power for other purposes e.g in industry and in the production of energy although the soviet_union in 1949 in common with the united_states of america had produced her own atom_bomb nevertheless the united_states was far more advanced than the ussr in nuclear technology sakharov was of the opinion that in the interests of peace it was important to narrow this lead in order to establish a balance in the arms_race capable of deterring both parties from initiating a war at the age of thirty two sakharov was elected to the russian academy of science of which he was the youngest member for his scientific work on_behalf of his country he has twice been awarded the order of lenin on one occasion the stalin prize and on three separate occasions he has been nominated a hero of socialist labour in 1968 however a significant change occurred in his status and way of life he was removed from his research post and allocated to work in the physics institute of the academy of science this change in sakharov's circumstances and standing was a direct result of a change in his way of thinking and his frank admission of this he describes this in his book sakharov speaks beginning in 1957 not without the influence of statements on this subject made throughout the world by such people as albert_schweitzer linus_pauling and others i felt myself responsible for the problem of radioactive contamination from nuclear explosions sakharov made no secret of the fact that he had arrived at these conclusions in fact he expressed himself frankly to the authorities in letters in which he set_forth his ideas on the situation he hoped that this might provide a basis for a free and open exchange of opinion but in this he was profoundly disappointed in one important respect however sakharov believes that his views have had some effect this was when the usa and the soviet_union completed an agreement in 1963 on a ban on nuclear_tests in the atmosphere in space and in the ocean in 1968 sakharov issued his famous manifesto on progress co existence and intellectual freedom sakharov's manifesto is not based only on conditions in his own_country it is written from a global point of view and constitutes an earnest appeal for peace to responsible men and women in every country the principal problem with which he deals here is the threat of the total annihilation of our civilisation which would result from a nuclear war he maintains that this danger can only be averted by means of worldwide cooperation transcending national and ideological boundaries in this connection he is particularly concerned with close contacts between the usa and the soviet_union it is his belief that peaceful co existence between these two super powers could be achieved if some measure of approximation were to take place between the political systems of these two states sakharov believes that this form of cooperation offers the only alternative to a nuclear war which he describes as collective suicide as far as his own country's contribution to this convergence is concerned he emphasises reforms such as democratisation debureaucratisation demilitarisation and social and scientific progress in close cooperation between these two super powers sakharov also envisages a possibility for a tremendous joint approach to a solution of world hunger overpopulation and pollution in his opinion too a substantial aid programme might provide a lasting foundation for a harmonious social and economic development of the third world the wholesale contributions made by the industrial countries would sakharov believes involve a considerable reduction in the amount of money spent by these countries on armaments as we all know these are ideas that have been repeatedly debated in the united_nations the philosophy at the back of this line of argument has inter_alia found expression in the appeal which the united_nations made in 1970 in rich member countries allocate one per_cent of their gross national product for aid to the developing_countries sakharov's manifesto which caused such a stir in large parts of the world was the first publication in which he gave a cohesive presentation of his views on the conditions necessary to a policy of détente and intellectual freedom in subsequent publications such as sakharov speaks and my country and the world his views on some of the problems he dealt with in his manifesto have undergone a change the reason for this he says is to be found in the dramatic international development of recent_years in conversations he has had with people from his own_country and abroad as well as in his own widened personal experience it is not so much the dream of the future with which he is preoccupied as all the dangers that threaten those that interpose themselves between the dream and reality in assessing the ideas set_forth in his manifesto sakharov personally emphasises that at the time he wrote it he was still living in an isolated and highly privileged scientific milieu without any contact_with the community outside this is how he describes his life at this time i was isolated from the people and in an interview he continues thus in evaluating my essay of 1968 you must understand this and take into account the route i followed from work on thermonuclear weapons to my concern about the results of nuclear_tests the destruction of people genetic consequences and all these things my life has been such that i began by confronting global problems and only later on more concrete personal and human ones it was his intimate contact_with the daily life of fellow human_beings and his concern that compelled him to commit himself to an intense struggle to find a solution for problems which he indicated openly in letters written to the authorities and for which he demanded reforms in an attempt to submit his proposals to a wider public sakharov founded the committee for human_rights in 1970 together with some friends and colleagues the aim of this committee was to work within the framework of the law to institute constructive reforms for the promotion of human_rights in accordance_with the humanist principles formulated in the united_nations declaration of human_rights of 1948 sakharov maintained that they should strive to achieve the following chief aims the abolition of secret trials a new press law ensuring that people would have full information reforms in the prison system the amnesty of political prisoners the abolition of the death penalty open frontiers and a ban on the use of psychiatric institutes for political ends it must be gratifying for sakharov to know that his ideas on the conditions necessary for peace and détente have found an echo in the agreement on security and cooperation in europe which was signed on august 1 this year by thirty five different nations in helsinki section vii of the helsinki agreement states the participating states will respect human_rights and fundamental freedoms including the freedom of thought conscience religion or belief for all without distinction as to race sex language or religion it goes on to state they will promote and encourage the effective exercise of civil political economic social cultural and other rights and freedoms all of which derive from the inherent dignity of the human person and are essential for his free and full development it is an historic event that the leading states of the world should have established in this document that human_rights are an essential factor in détente between nations no state and no single politician can suppress or evade the moral and political obligations that these articles impose by taking refuge in formalistic arguments couched in terms of international_law to do so would be a betrayal of mankind and of peace andrei dmitrievich sakharov has shown that he is prepared to bear his share of the burden in the words of the nobel_committee andrei sakharov's great contribution to peace is this that he has fought in a particularly effective manner and under highly difficult conditions in the greatest spirit of self sacrifice to obtain respect for these values that the helsinki agreement here declares to be its object sakharov's struggle for human_rights for disarmament and for cooperation between all nations has peace as its final goal for his endeavours to improve the lot of people in every country we pay our tribute to him here_today in awarding him the nobel peace_prize for 1975 the nobel_committee deeply deplores the fact that andrei_sakharov has been prevented from being present here_today in person to receive the peace_prize this is a fate he shares with the man who forty_years ago in 1935 was awarded the peace_prize his name was carl_von ossietzky the title page of sakharov's celebrated manifesto of 1968 carries these words of goethe as its motto only the man who has to fight for them daily deserves freedom and life andrei dmitrievich sakharov has in truth fulfilled goethe's conditions for possessing both freedom and life translation your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen on august 10 1976 a remarkable incident occurred in one of the streets of belfast in northern_ireland a man in an attempted getaway comes tearing down the street in his car trying to shake off his pursuers suddenly a shot rings out and with a mortally wounded driver slumped over the steering wheel the vehicle swerves into a fence knocking down a mother and her three children the mother though badly injured survived while her three children were killed on the spot surely this incident was not so remarkable no unfortunately it was not wherever war stalks the land and terror and violence erupt the killing of innocent children is in no way remarkable incidents of this kind are merely a logical result of the mindless brutality of war we have seen and heard this so often that we are in danger of forfeiting the ability to react in horror worse still every_single act of violence merely nurtures hatred fostering in turn more and more violence the event in belfast on that august day in 1976 however gave rise to something entirely different and it is for this reason that it was so remarkable in the area where the three children were killed lived a housewife she heard the thud as the car crashed into the fence and as she hurried to the spot she took in the whole horror of the scene at that moment something happened in that woman's mind it was like the bursting of a dam what she saw shocked her profoundly but even more she was overwhelmed with a passionate desire to make a stand against all violence and terror now for heaven's sake something must be done there was no time for deliberation and planning she never even thought of anything like that but acted intuitively as her heart dictated she started to go from door to door in the actual street where the tragedy had occurred the cup of horrors had now run over the time had come when the ordinary man and woman must rise in protest_against this senseless use of violence it was no_longer a question of political attitudes or religious convictions there was only one remedy the people themselves must cry halt radio and television showed a certain amount of interest in the housewife's campaign and she was given an opportunity of making a broadcast appeal to the irish people not to capitulate to terror peace must not be allowed to sit idly on the touchlines now for once peace must march her appeal found a ready response more and more people rallied to her call one of the first to do so was an aunt of the three children and these two women now marched boldly out into the no man's land of war proclaiming their simple heartening message of reconciliation from these small beginnings sprang what today the world over is known as the peace movement of northern_ireland today that housewife and the aunt of those three children are with us and today these two betty_williams and mairead_corrigan have come to receive the nobel peace_prize for 1976 one of the main reasons why the women proved so successful in their campaign is that on both_sides of the frontline a desperate yearning for peace had taken root what betty_williams and mairead_corrigan said re echoed the thoughts of tens of thousands and in this way they became the spokesmen of the desire for a commonsense approach that filled the average man and woman despite their feeling of helplessness in the face of violence but more_than that their courageous action cast a fresh light on the very essence of the grievous conflict that racked northern_ireland more clearly than ever before it appeared in its true light as a disease that ravaged the whole nation people's minds had somehow got stuck in a groove sound common sense could no_longer get a hearing the spirit that was now spread abroad was what the norwegian_poet bjornstjerne bjornson called passions crying need the conflict in northern_ireland springs from noxious roots deeply embedded in history countless attempts have been made to resolve it so far in vain those_who endeavoured to speak in the name of moderation appeared to speak to deaf ears a mood of hopeless resignation prevailed terror and violence became part and parcel of people's everyday lives barricades were thrown up in the streets sharp boundary lines divided one part of a town from another an ominous silence developed between neighbours even children were trained and committed to the use of violence society was at war with itself and even_though reason declared that the use of arms could never bring_about a lasting peace no one was capable of suggesting a viable alternative there is something unreal about the turmoil in northern_ireland something nightmarish a peaceful street is suddenly transformed into a theatre of war and the victims of that war are your own friends and neighbours even schoolchildren are fair game in homes in shops in offices and in pubs and factories the very air is poisoned with suspicion and hatred no struggle can be more bitter than one fought between people who in reality are so close to one another this in truth is what might be described as passions crying need it was in a situation of this kind that betty_williams and mairead_corrigan stood forth and with unerring instinct they started at the wrong end not at the top among the shrewd heads that were filled with so much political insight no they approached the ordinary men and women of every day with a clear and simple message we must put an end to the use of violence and to acts of terrorism we must build our future on peace and cooperation war is only senseless and evil incapable of solving any problem it would be simple to maintain that this is all self_evident and that anyone could say this in despair at the meaningless sufferings of war yes but in reality the solution of each and every human conflict is to be found in the simple and obvious action of someone taking the first steps on the road to reconciliation and cooperation this at any_rate is what happened in northern_ireland men and women from both camps came together and marched in demonstrations in support of the peace for which they all longed barbed wire barriers were removed barricades were torn down the ominous silence was broken neighbours and countrymen shook hands and started to talk together to live together and to build together the reaction to the campaign initiated by betty_williams and mairead_corrigan was wholesome and genuinely human it provided a proof of the inspiration that will flow precisely from the simple the true and the genuine which of course is also so obviously right the peace_prize winner andrei_sakharov once said that in a great many situations we need to formulate ideal goals even_though at any given moment it is impossible to envisage the road that leads to that goal without such ideals too there can be no hope and we shall be fumbling in the dark in a blind alley that offers no hope these words of sakharov's are true as well of betty_williams and mairead_corrigan they never claimed that they were in a position to indicate the only royal road that would lead to their goal but they were in no_doubt about the first step that must be taken along this road there would have to be an end to guerilla warfare and acts of violence and it should be possible to do this if people would only rise up in protest_against the war and join hands in the cause of peace that would be the first step in actual fact in so doing they struck a devastating blow at the very basis of guerilla warfare since it goes without saying that if violence were rejected by the great bulk of the population guerilla activities would automatically no_longer prove viable and it is precisely here that the dynamic force of the northern irish peace movement is to be found what it declares and proves in action is that the people of northern_ireland who have lived in a state of confrontation for decades are now tired of all this the desire for peace has been given fresh impetus more and more people realise that terror can never provide an answer to social injustice and act accordingly that so many people in northern_ireland have recognised this and have adjusted their lives in conformity with this is what we all hope may prove to be the first dawn of a new day bringing lasting peace to the sorely tried people of ulster the road leading to lasting peace may yet prove long and arduous and there are almost certainly a great many people who still doubt whether the peace movement can in the long_run achieve anything admittedly all too often champions of non_violence have been shouted down ridiculed and labelled utopians the peace movement of northern_ireland must be prepared to face such charges and have no_doubt already had to do so one incontrovertible fact remains they took the first courageous step along the road to peace they did so in the name of humanity and love of their neighbour someone had to start forgiving love of one's neighbour is one of the foundation stones of the humanism on which our western civilisation is built but it is vital that we should have the courage to sustain this love of our neighbour in the very circumstances when the pressure to abandon it is at its greatest otherwise it is of little worth this is why it is so important that it should shine forth when hatred and revenge threaten to dominate this spirit of human brotherhood is also the foundation for the human_rights which we believe are a part of the concept of peace we must ensure that each and every one of us enjoys the right to a life of human_dignity the future of the world depends on our success in fostering increased respect for this right i do not know whether betty_williams and mairead_corrigan were aware of the consequences when they started their peace movement but i_am quite sure that they have sensed how these forces have gathered strength around them during the time that ensued they unleashed a fervent desire and hope for peace that was latent in so many minds and out of this grew a peace movement almost before they themselves realised it with poignant simplicity and confidence they have accepted responsibility for something that they started and they have done this with the close cooperation and excellent assistance of a great many efficient fellow sympathisers no one knows today whether this organised movement will ever achieve its goals but its leaders have every right to believe and hope and work for the achievement of these goals in northern_ireland as well as elsewhere in the world there are a great many people who share their hope and belief betty_williams and mairead_corrigan have shown us what ordinary people can do to promote the cause of peace they have taught_us that the peace for which we strive is something that has to be won within and through the individual human being this is the message to which they have given renewed force through their activities alfred_nobel was constantly concerned with this possessed as he was with the questing mind of the inventor he developed a great many theories on the question of how to secure peace in 1891 he wrote to a friend that in many critical situations success in achieving a pause in the use of violence would prove decisive this would provide an opportunity of working still further on this basis the important thing was to mobilise good will in each of the opposed camps a basis existed for friendship for all people and the important thing was merely to discover this basis it was with this in mind that he stipulated in his will and testament that his peace_prize should be awarded to those_who had done most to promote the cause of the brotherhood of man there are some no_doubt who will say that this is much too naive in the brutal world familiar to us today to this alfred_nobel would probably have said give me a single example of progress for mankind which has not been derided by sceptics as utopian and escapist the two women who share the peace_prize for 1976 have refused to bow to bleak scepticism they simply acted they never heeded the difficulty of their task they merely tackled it because they were so convinced that this precisely was what was needed there was no talk here of ingenious theories of shrewd diplomacy or pompous declarations no their contribution was a far better one a courageous unselfish act that proved an inspiration to thousands that lit a light in the darkness and that gave fresh hope to people who believed that all hope was gone we admire betty_williams and mairead_corrigan for tackling so fearlessly the perilous task of leading the way into no man's land in the cause of peace and reconciliation it is for this deed that the norwegian_nobel committee has decided to honour them what they have done is an example to the world their action harmonised with what is the very basis of our civilisation and it sprang from a vision which shines like a bright torch into the future what they have built to quote once_again bjørnstjerne_bjørnson is a rainbow bridge of prayer above earth's fretful air a beacon light for man ablaze with christ's belief that love would conquer grief for thus his promise ran translation your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen this year the norwegian_nobel committee is awarding two peace prizes one to the initiators of the northern_ireland peace movement and one to the organisation amnesty_international these two movements have one thing in common they have sprung spontaneously from the individual's deep and firmly rooted conviction that the ordinary man and woman is capable of making a meaningful contribution to peace this is remarkable in an age when we live with the desperate pressure of the conviction that only the military power blocs equipped with nuclear_arms are in a position to decide for one and all of us the question of war or peace the two prizewinners have given a clear and simple no to violence torture and terrorism and an equally clear and unreserved yes to the defence of human_dignity and human_rights this is a philosophy and an attitude in harmony with the creed expressed by the norwegian_poet nordahl grieg in brutal strife your sword and shield shall be belief in life and human_dignity the two awards today clearly emphasise the nobel_committee's interpretation of the peace concept they establish the fact that peace is not merely abstinence from war but in addition respect for the human_rights proclaimed in the helsinki agreement of 1975 freedom of thought conscience religion or faith are essential prerequisites for peace the peace movement in northern_ireland champions the right of the individual to live a life free from fear from violence and acts of terrorism in other words external peace amnesty_international fights for man's right to freedom of conscience in other words to a life in internal peace taken together these two peace movements represent an aim which ordinary mortals associate with the dream of peace amnesty_international founded in london in 1961 by the english lawyer peter benenson can today look_back on sixteen years of activity it was a mere coincidence that led to the establishment of this organisation which today is global in its scope comprising some 100,000 members and some 2,000 groups in 33 different countries sitting in the compartment of a train in london one day in 1960 peter benenson happened to read in the papers of two portuguese students who had been sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for making critical remarks on salazar's regime peter benenson was not only profoundly shocked he decided then and there that he would try to help the two young men who had been the victims of this violation of justice his impulsive reaction to the sentence passed on these two may have sprung from an interpretation of the concept of freedom which says that freedom merely for adherents of a government or of one party is no freedom freedom will also mean freedom as well for those_who hold different views together with a number of others who shared his views benenson organised in the years that followed the movement which is known today as the prisoners friend amnesty_international the great and ambitious goal of this organization is to contribute to the implementation in every country of the principles of the declaration of human_rights it is now almost thirty_years since this declaration was adopted by the united_nations a great many high minded people have striven to put its ideals into_practice nevertheless in recent times we have witnessed an increasing use of brute force of violence on an international plane of torture and terrorism a great many people have been seized with a paralysing sense of horror and impotence faced with this situation amnesty so far from shrinking from its task has stepped up its efforts to ensure that governments in all countries should feel morally obliged to abide by the united_nations declaration of human_rights a number of nations maintained during the belgrade conference that for one country to call attention to a violation of human_rights in another country constituted interference in the internal affairs of that country i cannot believe that a ruse of this nature aimed_at glossing over injustices perpetrated in one's own_country will be countenanced by international opinion today on the contrary the view is now gaining ground that no state can lay claim to absolute national sovereignty where human_rights that are universally recognised are involved these rights are man's common property and no power constellation no dictator is entitled to deprive us of them the primary aim of amnesty_international is to work to secure the release of people imprisoned for their opinions who have made no use of violence or incited others to do so these prisoners are called prisoners of conscience the demand for their release only applies to this category of prisoner as far as all prisoners are concerned amnesty_international maintains as a general principle that they must be accorded legal defence and that their trials should be conducted openly furthermore all persons in custody both during the process of interrogation and the carrying_out of their sentence must be guaranteed humane treatment as far as the position of prisoners of conscience was concerned it was first and foremost articles 18 and 19 that needed to be emphasised these two articles establish everyone's right to freedom of thought conscience religion opinion and speech in recent_years too amnesty_international has campaigned rigorously for compliance with articles 5 and 9 which maintain that no prisoner must be subjected to torture or cruel and humiliating treatment and no one must be subject to arbitrary arrest imprisonment or banishment finally the movement is conducting a vigorous campaign against the use of capital punishment in its efforts to implement this programme amnesty_international has based its work on three irrevocable principles the organisation must at all times be neutral impartial and independent neutrality means that amnesty_international is to work just as energetically for every_single prisoner of conscience no matter what political or religious views the prisoner may hold this does_not necessarily imply that the organisation shares the views of the prisoner but that it maintains his right under any regime to give expression to his opinions amnesty_international is committed to political and geographical impartiality its eyes are open to coercion and injustice wherever in the world these evils appear in the east or the west or in the third world in reviewing a case it must be blind neither on the right eye nor on the left this involves a difficult balancing feat in an age in which distortion and confusion of concepts often appears to have become a political weapon but unswerving impartiality is a sine qua non if amnesty_international is to maintain its credibility and justify its existence the third principle of the organisation independence means that it may not base its activities on donations that might curtail its freedom or its activities amnesty_international is today financed almost exclusively by contributions from its national sections what are amnesty's chances of success in promoting its programme the organisation has refrained from intervening in the domestic or foreign_policy of its own government to avoid involvement in internal political strife an amnesty group never adopts prisoners from its own_country nor does amnesty organise demonstrations in support of its demands despite this it succeeds in making its views known this is due not least to the revealing reports published regularly by amnesty on prison conditions and torture in various countries it is clear that the organisation's future will to a large_extent depend on its ability to reach the ear of a favourable fair minded world opinion if it succeeds in doing this the most_important battle for human_rights will have been won in its organisational form and working methods amnesty differs from other movements it is based_on relatively small groups so_called adoption groups which adopt prisoners from countries with a different political background the various groups have close links with the head office in london where the great task of tracing helping and securing the release of prisoners incarcerated for reasons of conscience is carried on the adoption groups base their work for prisoners on a comprehensive body of information comprising the prisoners situation the state of justice in the country concerned and the possibility of despatching observers to investigate the prisoner's case and his situation one of the main preoccupations of amnesty_international is the constant efforts being made to ensure the negotiation of international agreements capable of securing the human_rights of prisoners and to protect them against physical and mental torture the united_nations have admittedly long since adopted minimum standards for prisons but the great question is whether these are practised in order to secure implementation of its demands that the declaration of human_rights should be adhered to by member nations of the uno amnesty has mooted the idea of a special high_commissioner for human_rights norway is one of the member countries supporting this proposal in the light of the fact that thirty five nations have this year foregathered in belgrade for protracted negotiations on the very subject of following up the promises embodied in the helsinki agreement to promote human_rights it is tragic to observe that this year too the uno has failed to implement the proposal for establishing a high_commissioner still more deplorable is the fact that the very countries in which these rights are today so monstrously trampled underfoot should have opposed this proposal and that they should be numerous enough to succeed what one might ask are the results of amnesty international's activities during these last sixteen years how many prisoners for example have been released as a result of amnesty's efforts perhaps the best answer is provided by a single set of statistics covering the period 1972 to 1975 which reveals that of the approximately 6,000 prisoners for whom amnesty was working at that time 3,000 were released a great many factors quite apart from amnesty may well have contributed to this result nevertheless these figures provide some indication of the scope of the work i do not consider it so important however to submit exact statistics nor is it likely that this is possible it is still more important to consider amnesty international's worldwide activities as an integral part in the incessant pressure exerted by all good forces on governments and on the united_nations organisation representing a coordinated and necessary effort to achieve an international society founded on justice the many thousands of individuals the world over working in the adoption groups develop moreover a close personal relationship to the prisoners they have adopted it must be a great source of joy to be able in practice to assist an individual prisoner and his family by sending letters and showing solicitude in so many ways likewise it must be a source of infinite comfort to the individual prisoner to feel that he has not been forgotten by the outside world that someone is working to achieve his release a release maybe from the most wretched dungeon amnesty has shone a torch of hope into his cell maybe precisely when its inmate is sunk in the depths of despair and degradation the prisoner derives comfort and strength from the knowledge that he is not alone in his suffering he can shed his fear of the grim reality of the saying that a person who has been forgotten is lost in deciding to honour amnesty_international with the nobel peace_prize in the year 1977 the year of prisoners of conscience the nobel_committee does so in the conviction that the defence of human_dignity against torture violence and degradation constitutes a very real contribution to the peace of this world in a word it may be said of amnesty international's activity today that this organisation has given a human answer to the appeal of the norwegian_poet arnulf øverland don't suffer too lightly oh never more injustice and wrongs that another bore but this work to protect human_dignity is not a sacrifice we make for others it is important that all of us should understand that in this age we must act accordingly in recognition of the earnest appeal contained in aleksandr solzhenitsyn s words you're defending yourself your future itself is at stake translation your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has awarded the peace_prize for 1978 to anwar_al sadat president of egypt and menachem_begin prime_minister of israel for their contribution to the two frame agreements on peace in the middle_east and on peace between egypt and israel which were signed at camp_david on september 17 1978 never previously in the history of the peace_prize stretching back over a period of almost eighty years have we witnessed an award_ceremony such as this in king haukon v's medieval castle of akershus with its memories of far off times of war and unrest in the chronicles of our land never has the nobel_committee considered it apposite to award the peace_prize to statesmen from the troubled and sadly devastated middle_east never has the prize been closely associated with agreements such as the two camp_david agreements which provide the basis for the award to the two statesmen on whose shoulders such grave responsibilities have fallen never has the peace_prize expressed a greater or more audacious hope a hope of peace for the people of egypt for the people of israel and for all the peoples of the strife torn and war ravaged middle_east the award of the prize to the president of egypt anwar_al sadat and the prime_minister of israel menachem_begin is moreover historical in the wider sense in that we only know of one previous peace agreement between egypt and israel this as israeli scholars have revealed took_place some 3,000 years_ago it was the peace concluded between king david's son wise king solomon and the egyptian pharaoh it was in this part of the world that the cradle of our civilisation was to be found more_than 6,000 years_ago here communities with a high standard of culture which were to exercise a profound influence on the development of human society in other parts of the world grew_up and flourished today every_single schoolchild knows from his or her history books that it was here that our written history first began and adherents of three historically related religions islam judaism and christianity have turned their gaze with unflagging devotion to that part of the world from which their religion sprang the middle_east situated as it is at the junction of asia europe and africa has been not only a meeting place for cultures but also a battleground for economic interests and foreign conquerors again and again cultural splendour and material prosperity have been rudely interrupted by wars foreign domination and internal schism in our own time the struggle of the arabs to free themselves from alien domination was crowned with success when egypt shook off the british yoke in this struggle for national liberation anwar_al sadat played a leading part at the same_time the national movement sprang up in the little jewish communities that for two thousand years had been scattered around in various countries all over the world but holding fast at all times to memories and hopes of their historical homeland the anti semitism which culminated with hitler's mass slaughter of europe's jews drove them to seek security and rebirth in their own_country of israel with the active participation of the united_nations the state of israel was established in 1948 the state and nation of israel had now become a political and human fact the establishment of an israeli state ushered in a new conflict throughout the middle_east in the course of the last thirty_years this dispute between the jews and arabs has unleashed four wars which have not only caused tremendous material damage but also exacerbated hostility between them side by side with war and destruction however the constructive forces of peace too have hewn out a path for themselves over the years a great_deal of goodwill has been harnessed to breach the psychological wall which has all too long constituted a bar to understanding and human contact between the arab_states and the israelis this is a wall of frightening dimensions which president anwar_al sadat once compared to the great barrier reef off the coast of australia two men who played a vital role in paving the way for this peace deserve to be mentioned former secretary of state henry_kissinger and the president of the united_states jimmy_carter henry kissinger's peace mission in the middle_east was launched immediately after the conclusion of the fourth war between israel on the one hand and egypt and syria on the other we recall his energetic attempts to get the belligerent parties in the so_called jom kippur war to come together for a peace conference in geneva the conference did in fact materialise in december 1973 and resulted in agreement between egypt and israel on a number of important points such as the exchange of prisoners the withdrawal of troops to delimited zones security guarantees and other measures aimed_at consolidating the truce and with a peace agreement as a long_term goal henry kissinger's work in promoting the agreements concluded between the belligerents after the jom kippur war in 1973 provided the basis for president jimmy carter's move in organising the meeting at camp_david in 1978 the dramatic highlight in the efforts to arrive_at a peaceful settlement was provided by president anwar_al sadat's courageous journey to jerusalem on november 19 1977 with his bold visit to the israeli parliament knesset president sadat cut the gordian knot at a single stroke the way was now open for the meetings at camp_david where the first constructive steps were taken in the form of two agreements of fundamental importance the frame agreement for peace in the middle_east and the frame agreement for concluding peace between egypt and israel it is for their work in laying a foundation for future peace between these two one time enemy countries that the president of egypt anwar_al sadat and the prime_minister of israel menachem_begin have been honoured with the nobel peace_prize for 1978 the four wars in the middle_east merely foreshadowed fresh conflicts new material destruction and human tragedy amid this darkness we glimpsed a sudden light and a victory is won without a war as president sadat sets off on his journey to the city of peace as he called jerusalem in his historic speech in the knesset his outstretched_hand and offer of peace friendship and cooperation sets the spirit of the frame agreement pointing the way to realities in a final peace agreement based_on normal diplomatic economic and cultural links the masterbuilder responsible for the bridge that had to be built between egypt and israel in order that these two one time enemy nations should have any opportunity of coming together to frame an agreement was the president of the usa jimmy_carter president sadat has described the importance of this vital step in the work of pioneering a peace in the following words jimmy_carter was the unknown soldier with regard to the second frame agreement from camp_david for peace in the middle_east important and apparently time consuming negotiations on the west bank gaza and the golan heights still remain to be completed the future alone can provide an answer to these questions meanwhile the world must be allowed to share in the happiness of the people of egypt and israel that for the first time since the re establishrment of the state of israel in 1948 an agreement has successfully been reached which on a long_term basis provides a genuine opportunity for peace in an area over which the shadow of war had hovered so long without speculating on conflicting theories on the actual driving forces at work in history there is surely general agreement that two men the president of egypt anwar_al sadat and the prime_minister of israel menachem_begin have played key roles in the quest for peace between two former enemies which today is such a source of gratification to true friends of peace the world over these two men have a great_deal in common they were born in a century marked by global wars and gigantic revolutions of racial problems and foreign domination both of them have been active in the mainstream of history in its political and social conflicts from their earliest years they have identified themselves with the fate of their countries they have fought and suffered in prison and in labour camp for the sovereignty of their native land and for the freedom of man their lives and paths have crossed in an act of peace that may well usher in a new era a future of material renewal and peace not only for their two respective countries but for the entire middle_east president anwar_al sadat was born on december 25 1918 he spent the early years of childhood in the little village of mit abul kum on the banks of the nile his memoirs are deeply imbued with his intense feeling of kinship with the earth and the life of the village in which he was born his childhood is summed up in one lyrical phrase everything i experienced in mit abul kum made me happy this included his sense of oneness with nature his participation in the collective work of the peasants and not least life in a family which included a paternal grandmother who though unlettered was noted for her wisdom today whenever he speaks of his grandmother president sadat does so with such warmth and devotion that we immediately sense how love for her still lives on in his heart he still recalls her simple words nothing is of such great importance as the fact that you are a child of this earth the earth can never die in it lies the mystery of creation president sadat defines his faith thus i shall never go astray because i know with such certainty that i have my roots in the village deep down in the soil from which i like the trees and other growing things have sprung throughout his turbulent life sadat has felt a need for the inner harmony and balance which affinity with the soil has given him during his childhood and adolescent years egypt was under british domination early on sadat determined to fight for the independence of his country for this reason he chose the profession of army officer and together with gamal abdel nasser a friend from his school days he founded in 1939 at the age of 21 a secret group of officers whose aim it was to free egypt from foreign rule in the course of this struggle he was arrested in 1942 and stripped of his officer's rank after a successful escape from prison he remained in hiding until he was arrested in 1946 and sentenced to three years imprisonment in 1950 he was reinstated in the army in 1952 sadat was one of the leading spirits in the egyptian revolution which led to the fall of king farouk in 1969 he was appointed vice presidernt of egypt by president nasser and on nasser's death in 1970 he was elected_president of egypt president sadat has piloted his country through a difficult period involving war as well as far_reaching economic problems it is to president sadat's credit that he realised that the solution to important social and economic problems in his own_country demanded too the conclusion of a peace settlement with israel all in all president sadat's policy during all these years has reflected a willingness to re think old problems and courage to break away from traditional diplomatic methods during the thirty preceding years the peoples of the middle_east have on four separate occasions been the victims of warfare and there seemed no prospect of peace president sadat's great contribution to peace was that he had sufficient courage and foresight to break away from this vicious_circle his decision to accept prime_minister menachem begin's invitation of november 17 1977 to attend a meeting of the israeli parliament on november 19 was an act of great courage both from a personal and from a political point of view this was a dramatic break with the past and a courageous step forward into a new age in jerusalem sadat frankly submitted his demands but in return offered recognition of israel as a state as well as conciliation and peace sadat's outstretched_hand was accepted by israel's prime_minister menachem_begin the other main protagonist in the camp_david agreement the political situation into which menachem_begin was born in 1913 in the polish town of brest litovsk provided a starting_point and a decisive guideline for his turbulent career the impression made on him by the violent and increasing anti semitism nourished in him at an early_age the yearning and the determination to return to the ancient home of the jews in israel while studying law he joined the jewish youth movement in may 1939 he was imprisoned for participation in a demonstration in favour of the right of the persecuted european jews to emigrate to palestine after a brief spell in prison he fled to lithuania in the hope that from this country he and his family might make their way to palestine the soviet russian occupation of lithuania in 1939 however effectively prevented this he was arrested and sentenced to eight years forced labour in a siberian prison camp after the german attack on the soviet_union he was released in company with thousands of other political prisoners as the authorities hoped in this way to be able to provide sufficient recruits for a polish army to be deployed in the struggle_against nazism begin now joined the polish forces which were being trained on soviet soil and despatched to transjordan in 1942 he made his way from that country to palestine which at that time was being administered as a british mandated territory at this time the british authorities imposed very severe restrictions on immigration permits for jews who during the war were under the threat of extermination in the german gas chambers menachem_begin deployed all his energy to circumvent these rigorous regulations he joined the national combatant organisation irgun zvai leumi and soon rose to be its leader during the first few years irgun collaborated with the british authorities in the struggle_against german nazism however when the british despite systematic nazi extermination of the european jews persisted in maintaining their immigration policy for palestine irgun adopted a more obdurate line under begin's leadership demanding now not only an open door for jewish refugees but also the right to the establishment of an independent jewish state from then and up to 1947 begin and the underground movement irgun waged a relentless struggle_against the british administration at one time the british authorities set a price of 30,000 on his head in 1947 when fighting broke_out between arabs and jews irgun was finally recognised by the jewish authorities and integrated as a regular unit in the jewish military organisation haganah when the state of israel became a reality in 1948 begin founded his own political party herut which was radically opposed to the israeli labour party mapai led by ben gurion at the 1977 elections the conservative alliance known as likud won a major political victory and on june 21 1977 menachem_begin became prime_minister of israel and it was he who on_behalf of the state of israel accepted president sadat's outstretched_hand egypt and israel now enjoy the prospect of an end to thirty_years of hostility interrupted merely by brief intervals of truce complex problems of international_law as well as military and economic problems must be solved and old suspicions and prejudices swept aside it is easy to state the nature of this formidable task but can it be solved can entirely new relations be created between people in an area where for decades the shadow of war has eclipsed all hope in his historic speech to the knesset today's peace_prize laureate anwar_al sadat answered this question with the following words i truly tell you we have before us today an opportunity for peace which time will never repeat and we must seize it if we are really serious in struggling for peace if we weaken or fritter away this opportunity we shall end in a new blood bath he who has conspired to lose it will have the curse of humanity and history on his head on the same occasion today's other prize_winner prime_minister menachem_begin expressed his own views on the potentialities of peace we believe that if we achieve peace true peace we shall be able to assist one another in all realms of life and a new era will be opened in the middle_east an era of flourishing and growth of development and progress and advancement as in ancient times men of good will all over the world will now follow in their thoughts these two prize_winners in their endeavours to solve this great task of establishing peace this is a wish that has been expressed in the camp_david agreement the people of the middle_east yearn for peace so that the vast human and natural resources of the region can be turned to the pursuits of peace and so that this area can become a model for coexistence and cooperation among nations today throughout the world we are celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the universal_declaration of human_rights may i express the hope that this nobel peace_prize ceremony enacted in our small and wintry country tucked away near the arctic circle may provide an enduring reminder to the world that it was here that representatives of egypt and israel shook hands as they celebrated the greatest of all victories conciliation and lasting peace based_on respect for human_rights and human_dignity translation your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has awarded the peace_prize for 1979 to mother_teresa the year 1979 has not been a year of peace disputes and conflicts between nations peoples and ideologies have been conducted with all the accompanying extremes of inhumanity and cruelty we have witnessed wars the unrestrained use of violence we have witnessed fanaticism hand in hand with cynicism we have witnessed contempt for human life and dignity we are faced with new and overwhelming floods of refugees not without reason the word genocide has been on many lips in many countries completely innocent people have been the victims of acts of terror in this year moreover we recall the way in which an entire ethnic group was virtually exterminated in europe only a generation ago the holocaust film series has shaken us not only as an evil memory from our own not too distant past and as we consider the world of 1979 not one of us can be certain that the like may not recur in the future the norwegian_nobel committee has considered it right and appropriate precisely in the year in their choice of mother_teresa to remind the world of the words spoken by fridtjof_nansen love of one's neighbour is realistic policy as a description of mother_teresa's life's work we might select the slogan that a previous nobel peace_prize laureate albert_schweitzer adopted as the leitmotif for his own work veneration for life over the years the committee has frequently awarded nobel's peace_prize to statesmen men who have carried_out their work under the conditions that obtain in our imperfect world in the opinion of the committee they had played a dominant role in bringing to an end wars that had already broken out seeking peaceful solutions to conflicts and in preventing fresh outbreaks of war the committee has awarded the prize to idealists who explored avenues leading to a better world in which war would be meaningless or inconceivable and where traditional statesmanship would be superfluous the prize has been awarded to individuals and organisations which through international humanitarian work and cooperation have been able to contribute to the brotherhood of nations that alfred_nobel hoped that his peace_prize would promote the prize has been awarded to scientists and organisations dedicated to the task of tackling and overcoming economic and social privation not least hunger which is yet another threat to brotherhood and peace the committee has awarded the peace_prize to champions of equality and fraternity among peoples of different race in every country and in every part of the world it has awarded the prize to champions of human_rights of the individual man's and woman's claim to the protection of his or her integrity body and soul against the power of the state that is so often abused there are many paths we can and must pursue to reach our goals brotherhood and peace in awarding nobel's peace_prize for 1979 to mother_teresa the committee has posed a focal question that we encounter along all these paths can any political social or intellectual feat of engineering on the international or on the national plane however effective and rational however idealistic and principled its protagonists may be give us anything but a house built on a foundation of sand unless the spirit of mother_teresa inspires the builders and takes its dwelling in their building mother_teresa was born into an albanian roman_catholic family in the yugoslavian town of skopje she relates that at the age of twelve she felt a vocation to help the poor a few years later she listened to accounts of conditions in bengal as related by missionaries and decided there and then that she would work as a missionary in india at the age of eighteen she joined the irish loreto order whose sisters ran a mission station in calcutta from 1929 to 1946 she taught at the girls school run by the order in that city it was in 1946 that she applied for permission to go out and work among the poor in the slums of the city she felt this to be a fresh vocation a vocation within a vocation as she herself has expressed it she had a glimpse of the poverty and squalor of the slums of sick people who remained untended of lonely men and women lying down to die on the pavement of the thousands of orphaned children wandering around with no one to care for them it was among these people that she felt a call to work and to spend the rest of her life in daily contact_with them she left the sheltered world of the convent and the fashionable girls school behind her her plea to be allowed to go out into the slums and work there was granted in 1948 she received permission to change from the uniform of the loreto order to the customary cheap indian sari she started her work after an intensive course in nursing she was joined by a number of former pupils and other young women in 1948 this little local community was recognised as a new separate order the missionaries of charity in addition to the customary convent vows a fourth promise to give wholehearted free service to the very poorest was added fifteen years later in 1965 mother_teresa's order was recognised as a papal congregation under the protection of the vatican in the years that had elapsed the missionaries of charity had witnessed a growth that no one could have foreseen and which was to continue in time more and more women indian as well as foreign volunteered for this service and were recruited into the order it also received the support of an auxiliary organisation consisting of male lay helpers its activities include slum schools homes for orphaned children mobile clinics leprosy centres hostels for the dying food kitchens vocational training and much else besides in recent_years the order has extended its activities to cover twenty new countries although the main emphasis is still on india and the neighbouring state of bangladesh to date several million people have benefited from the social welfare and rescue work of the order the norwegian_nobel committee is delighted to note this impressive and steadily growing scope of the work undertaken by the order it has not however attached decisive_importance to statistical information it has not compared such statistics with figures attributable to other organisations and institutions many of these have carried_out work that merits the greatest respect nor has the committee considered the relationship_between private and public activity in the work of redressing and overcoming the physical privation and distress in the world the committee has attached decisive_importance to the spirit that has permeated this work this has been mother_teresa's fundamental contribution to the order she has created and run this it is that explains both why so many people should flock to join the order and the interest and respect she has encountered throughout the world this springs from mother_teresa's own fundamental attitude to life and her very special personality this is clearly and firmly rooted in her christian faith she received the first announcement of the award of the peace_prize with these words i accept the prize in the name of the poor the prize is the recognition of the poor world jesus said i_am hungry i_am naked i_am homeless by serving the poor i_am serving him she is merely repeating what she has so often said before actually we are touching christ's body in the poor in the poor it is the hungry christ that we are feeding it is the naked christ that we are clothing it is the homeless christ that we are giving shelter or again when i wash that leper's wounds i feel i_am nursing the lord himself she sees christ in every human being and this in her eyes makes man sacred the hallmark of her work has been respect for the individual and the individual's worth and dignity the loneliest and the most wretched the dying destitute the abandoned lepers have been received by her and her sisters with warm compassion devoid of condescension based_on this reverence for christ in man better than anyone_else she has managed to put into_practice the recognised fact that gifts given de haut en bas where the recipient has a feeling of one sided and humiliating dependence on the giver may prove so hurtful to the recipient's dignity as a human being that it may well breed bitterness and animosity instead of harmony and peace she has arrived at an attitude to the relationship_between donor and recipient which eliminates the generally accepted conceptual distinction in her eyes the person who in the accepted sense is the recipient is also the giver and the one who gives most giving giving something of oneself is what confers real joy and the person who is allowed to give is the one who receives the most precious gift where others see clients or customers she sees fellow workers a relationship based not on the expectation of gratitude on the one part but on mutual understanding and respect and a warm human and enriching contact she and her sisters regard their work as a cherished duty and not as a burden many visitors have described their first impression of her homes for dying people brought in from the streets or of the reception centres for outcast lepers their first impression is likely to be a harrowing one but in next to no time they are carried away by the atmosphere of serenity and joy that the sisters create around them this is the life of mother_teresa and her sisters a life of strict poverty and long days and nights of toil a life that affords little room for other joys but the most precious a norwegian_poet who did not share the religious creed of mother_teresa has written a poem containing an idea she would have no difficulty in recognising life can offer one happiness that cannot be turned into grief giving joy to another is a joy beyond belief there's a sorrow that haunts the world and never a tear can abate but when you've realised the truth of this it's already my friend too late who can stand all his life by a grave weeping a bitter tear with so many hours in the day and so many days in the year no hour no day is lost for mother_teresa's sisters in calcutta for them these are all hours and days of joy mother_teresa's work is grounded in the christian faith she has worked among and for people who are not adherents of her religion she has been a european among indians but this has proved no obstacle and perhaps it would be more correct to say that the work carried_out in her spirit has overcome all obstacles in 1972 the president of the republic of india had these words to say about her mother_teresa is one of those liberated souls who have transcended all barriers presented by race religion and nationality in our present day troubled world incessantly plagued by conflict and hatred the life that is lived and the work that is carried_out by people like mother_teresa bring new hope for the future of mankind an indian journalist wrote recently that the sisters with their serene ways their saris their knowledge of local languages have come to symbolise not only the best in christian charity but also the best in indian culture and civilisation from buddah to gandhi the great saints the seers the great lovers of humanity with boundless compassion and consideration for the underprivileged what shakespeare called the quality of mercy mother_teresa has personally succeeded in bridging the gulf that exists between the rich nations and the poor nations her view of the dignity of man has built a bridge unencumbered and naturally she has crossed the gulf by means of this bridge in india encounters of this kind between people have proved possible they have been welcomed with open arms and for this india too deserves our appreciation her message has found an echo among people of a different faith in their tradition too we find a groping for the same answers to questions that form part of our human existence with her message she is able to reach through to something innate in every humankind if for no other purpose than to create a potential a seed for good if this were not the case the world would be deprived of hope and work for peace would have little meaning it would furthermore be incompatible with mother_teresa's own view of human_beings the men and women she serves because she wishes to serve christ and approach more closely to him mother_teresa once said in these twenty_years of work among the people i have come more and more to realise that it is being unwanted that is the worst disease that any human being can ever experience she believes that the worst disease today is not leprosy or tuberculosis but rather the feeling of being unwanted uncared for and deserted by everybody it was precisely people in this plight the poorest of the poor who were the very first to find warmth and shelter with mother_teresa her intention was to ensure that they enjoyed the feeling of being received and recognised as people with their own human_dignity and the right to respect mother_teresa works in the world as she finds it in the slums of calcutta and other towns and cities but she makes no distinction between poor and rich persons between poor and rich countries politics have never been her concern but economic social and political work with these same aims are in complete harmony with her own life's work in our endeavours on the national as on the international level we have a lesson to learn from her work for individuals in distress on the international level our efforts can only serve the cause of peace if they do not offend the self respect of the poor nations all aid given by the rich countries must be given in the spirit of mother_teresa there would be no better way of describing the intentions that have motivated the decision of the norwegian_nobel committee than the comment of the president of the world bank robert macnamara when he declared mother_teresa deserves nobel's peace_prize because she promotes peace in the most fundamental manner by her confirmation of the inviolability of human_dignity from nobel lectures peace 1971 1980 editor in charge tore frängsmyr editor irwin abrams world scientific publishing co singapore 1997 translation your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has awarded the peace_prize for 1980 to adolfo_pérez esquivel he has devoted many years of his life to the cause of human_rights in argentina and the whole of latin_america he is an untiring and consistent champion of the principle of nonviolence in the struggle for social and political liberty he has lit a light in the dark a light which in the opinion of our committee should never be allowed to be extinguished adolfo_pérez esquivel is furthermore a champion of nonviolence in relations_between nations he has for instance warned of the danger of an escalation of the territorial conflict between argentina and chile the year 1980 has proved no more encouraging than 1979 in the struggle to promote human_rights and peace in asia last year one of the largest countries in the area iran rose to overthrow a tyranny and a dictatorship renouncing the protection of a major power that had cooperated with the old regime and initiating a rapid reduction of its armed_forces it has subsequently been attacked by a neighbouring country and the ensuing war is still being waged moreover for a whole year the iranians have been perplexed spectators to a campaign launched by a superpower in an adjoining country this war too is still being fought the war in afghanistan more_than anything else has cast its dark shadow on men and women in the part of the world to which we norwegians belong the fear of loss of liberty and human_rights contends in many minds with the fear of war this autumn europe witnessed the breakthrough of a movement for freedom in poland this movement has been marked by moderation and a realistic approach it has set itself limited goals it has clung to the policy of nonviolence its unshaken spiritual foundation is respect for human_rights we await the outcome in anxiety and hope knowing that it will have a profound and lasting effect on our entire continent as well as far_beyond its borders the two courageous women from northern_ireland who received the nobel peace_prize for 1976 mairead_corrigan and betty_williams have made it known publicly that they had nominated adolfo_pérez esquivel for the peace_prize they themselves had been awarded the peace_prize because prompted by their own bitter experience they were prepared to work actively for peace brotherhood and mutual respect in the relations_between protestant and roman_catholic sections of the population in a northern_ireland racked with terror hate riddened and strickened with fear the grievous purely personal stresses and strains these two brave women of their own choice were prepared to undergo and the tense situation that still prevails in their land illustrate how arduous the struggle for peace brotherhood and human_dignity may prove from his closely confined exile in gorky the laureate for 1975 andrei_sakharov has conveyed his greetings to esquivel through the medium of his wife while at the same_time the ranks of human_rights protagonists around him have been decimated by arrest and banishment in his message sakharov expresses his understanding for the gravity and the tragedy of the problems facing your country and other countries in latin_america your vigorous struggle for justice and the help you have given to people suffering under oppression are cherished by people who live thousands of miles away in another world last year nobel's peace_prize was awarded to mother_teresa she had worked among the most destitute the lonely the outcast the dying in calcutta and in other parts of the world the committee made it clear that the reason for awarding her the prize was not the great scope that her activities had achieved but the spirit that inspired and informed it those_who came or were brought to her and her sisters were to enjoy the feeling of being received and recognised as people with their own human_dignity and the right to respect to quote words used on the occasion of the presentation of the peace_prize to mother_teresa in this university festival hall can any political social or intellectual feat of engineering on the international or on the national plane however effective and rational however idealistic and principled its protagonists may be give us anything but a house built on a foundation of sand unless the spirit of mother_teresa inspires the builders and takes its dwelling in their building in the opinion of our committee it is this spirit too that inspires her co religionist esquivel in his choice of a different and wider field of activity than mother_teresa's he has heard and answered a social and political call to change the social and political world around him so that respect for man's right and dignity can be aroused in the hearts of all to the benefit of all mankind may i quote once_again from last year's presentation ceremony mother_teresa works in the world as she finds it in the slums of calcutta and other towns and cities but she makes no distinction between poor and rich persons between poor and rich countries politics have never been her concern but economic social and political work with these same aims is in complete harmony with her own life's work in this respect the award this year has its parallel in last year's adolfo_pérez esquivel was born in buenos_aires in 1931 he is a well_known architect and also a sculptor his sculptures are to be seen in various public places in argentina in 1968 he was appointed professor of architecture and sculpture at the national academy of art in buenos_aires in 1971 his life took a new turn the roman_catholic church in latin_america was subject to a spirit of ferment which influenced him too various circles within the church raised fresh questions with regard to the duties of the church and of christians to the community in which they live they espoused the cause not only of respect for human_dignity in the classical sense of the word but also of economic and social reforms they sought contact_with workers and peasants and supported the landless peasants demands for land and the workers right to organisation and solidarity esquivel's intense commitment to the cause of human_rights and nonviolent methods however was fuelled by the special situation that was developing in his own_country of argentina there was a risk that a wave of terror and counterterror might erupt esquivel joined a group who rejected terror as a weapon seeking inspiration instead from mohandas gandhi and advocating a campaign of nonviolence as a means of achieving liberation at a conference in montevideo in 1968 a joint organisation was set_up embracing active nonviolent groups throughout latin_america in 1974 it was decided to continue along more permanent lines and esquivel was entrusted with the post of secretary_general resigning from his professorship in order to devote himself wholly to his new vocation the name of the organisation paz y justicia peace and justice clearly indicates the organisation's fundamental views and programme its publication bearing the same name proved a link between groups of likeminded persons throughout latin_america their activities were and still are coordinated in the organisation's modest offices in buenos_aires as its secretary_general esquivel visited a number of other countries for the purpose of conferences and talks on two occasions he was arrested and expelled in brazil in 1975 and in ecuador in 1976 in 1976 the organisation moved to persuade the united_nations to establish a human_rights commission documents were drawn_up providing evidence of violations of human_rights in latin_america in order to solicit support for this esquivel visited a number of european countries on his return he was arrested in buenos_aires no charge was preferred against him he was not even interrogated he has given us little indication of the way he was personally treated in prison after fourteen months he was released but under the obligation to report to the police as well as being subject to other restrictions these restrictions were somewhat relaxed in 1979 meanwhile he has resumed his work with paz y justicia this year he was in a position to undertake a number of fresh journeys which included europe this autumn he visited the neighbouring country of chile in order to conduct a series of talks with a number of institutions organisations and groups among them the so_called group of 24 which comprises lawyers of various political persuasions early in the 1970s argentina experienced conditions not far removed from civil war with extreme terrorist organisations highly organised and amply supplied with weapons creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear with murder bomb attacks abductions and blackmail a state of bloody urban warfare much of it conducted at night developed with terrorists from the right and terrorists from the left ranged against one another successive governments failed to solve the crisis and to stem the tide the number of victims rose alarmingly right up to the year 1976 the military regime that was then established has however itself resorted to extreme violence thousands of people have disappeared without a trace and we know that in many cases they have been tortured and killed this has been carried_out under a veil of profound silence without any public announcements without any trial or verdict the victims have been people far removed from terrorism in all its many forms in order to prevent the creation of a climate of public_opinion and to ensure an atmosphere of indifference and apparent assent to these methods appeals have been made to people's fear of argentina once_again reverting to the conditions obtaining in the early 1970s there is no_doubt that this fear is still very much alive today but in order to ensure that the wall of silence is not breached talking and writing about those_who have disappeared los desuparecidos has at the same_time become a perilous undertaking among those_who have disappeared are journalists who not only knew too much but who were anxious to publish what they knew throughout these troubled times adolfo_pérez esquivel has stuck unflinchingly to his principles he was himself a supporter of far_reaching social and political reforms to this extent he was in a position to appreciate some of the motives that prompted terrorism inspired by the left but when with mohandas gandhi as his great example he embarked on a hunger strike in 1970 71 he did so as a protest_against terrorism both from the right and from the left and among other_things against the abduction and subsequent blackmail of one of the directors for a fiat factory in argentina for this reason he occupies today a position of great moral strength in his campaign against the methods that are being used he can reply calmly to those_who regard his protests against such police methods as a defense and protection for terrorists to quote his own words we have denounced repression of all kinds we have denounced the killing of generals colonels and innocent relatives of military officials we have no connections with political parties of any sort much less armed groups we act by means of evangelical nonviolence which we see as a force for liberation the aims symbolised by the very name of the organisation paz y justicia go well beyond a protest_against terror and violence in his own words you cannot talk solely of human_rights in terms of torture imprisonment and killing true this is the gravest aspect but we must also look at the case of the peasant who has no land and is dying of hunger for esquivel as for gandhi nonviolence involves much more_than a mere passive acceptance of the world as it is it is a strategy in a struggle to change the world using means that will not stifle the good intentions and the results one aims to achieve this is what the movement and its secretary_general represent throughout latin_america it is divided into three regions each with its own office coordinated from the head office in buenos_aires it is ecumenical and no one is excluded on religious grounds nevertheless it is rooted in the fermentation and new ideas that have been stirring in the dominant roman_catholic church in latin_america during the last fifteen years the visible results of which have included the two meetings of bishops in medellin in colombia in 1968 and in puebla in mexico in 1978 these new trends however which have also encountered a certain amount of resistance aim to forge new links between the church and the broad masses of the people this means that clergy and laymen must undertake fresh obligations within the community the church must not be content merely to carry_out its ritual functions baptism mass funerals which are part of its accepted routine nor must it merely be content to provide social relief to those in need in a spirit of compassion and self sacrifice though this too has always been accepted as one of its tasks nor must it be content merely to exercise man's duty to his neighbour on the purely personal level and in his immediate circle a new keyword in this roman_catholic philosophy has been evangelisation and this word has acquired an extended meaning numerous working and discussion groups have grown up in which men and women debate and assume obligations to their community the aim too is to include the poor and underprivileged attempts have been made to organise them in a struggle to achieve their rights by the creation of fresh organisations or by support for the old ones the church is under strong pressure to define its own attitude to political economic and social problems a great many different trends are involved the organisation possesses no ready made models or systems engineered to produce the perfect community nor are there any recipes for economic strategy capable of ensuring a state of welfare that could be enjoyed by all this lies outside the task of the church in this world but as a minimum society is expected not to reconcile itself to conditions that make it impossible for men and women to gain respect for their human_dignity or to accord this respect to others the leaders of society too are expected to show in their politics respect for human_dignity in all men and women without any exception the organisation repudiates any policy inspired by greed selfishness and lust for power and which ignores the great mass of the people this is where people like esquivel take their place in the social struggle for him the strategy of nonviolence is the only right approach poverty spawns terrorism and terrorism increases poverty he once said it is clear to him that violence as a means to an end destroys the very aim one originally dreamt of achieving latin_america is a subcontinent embracing a great many countries with an extreme range of different conditions many of them are much poorer than argentina many of them have inherited far deeper historical sources of friction between sections of the population with different origins and many of them are much smaller and more helpless than argentina nevertheless the committee is of the opinion that adolfo_pérez esquivel has a message that is valid for the whole of latin_america and not only for that part of the world a great many organisations in latin_america are working on the basis of the same fundamental_principles paz y justicia may not necessarily have the largest membership these fundamental_principles are supported by many excellent spokesmen in numerous countries men who may be better known than esquivel the reason his voice reached all the way from latin_america to the norwegian_nobel committee was not because of its strength but because of its purity and clarity it is our hope that his work will bear fruit in his own_country that it will hearken to his voice and break_out from the vicious_circle of terror and counter terror of anarchy and reaction setting an example to the whole of latin_america commenting on the committee's choice an english speaking newspaper in buenos_aires had the following comment to make the balance of power between those_who are prepared to defend any means to achieve a particular goal and those_who insist that a crime is a crime no matter who commits it or for what reason has now been changed in argentina it is also gratifying to note that one of the major argentinian newspapers which wrongly suspects the norwegian_nobel committee of ignoring violations of human_rights in other countries with different systems and ideologies from those obtaining in present day argentina concludes by stating that if this suspicion were to prove incorrect then the award of the prize should be welcomed this inspires us with hope the norwegian_nobel committee has frequently been accused both at home and abroad of looking at the world through norwegian spectacles from the standpoint of norwegian attitudes and norwegian interests but we gladly accept this description of our committee which appeared in the great chilean weekly hoy written by the former minister of justice professor sinhuega after esquivel's visit in an article entitled who is he it the norwegian_nobel committee is familiar with pérez's work and ideas it has been informed of torture and of persons who disappeared there in norway human life means a great_deal whatever human life is involved maybe the committee's choice reflects the norwegian cultural background this is possibly inevitable but in this case as in others this background has surely served to build a bridge between us and champions of human_dignity in other parts of the world people such as adolfo_pérez esquivel and his fellow workers your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has awarded the peace_prize for 1981 to the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees i take it that no one regards the award for the prize as exclusively or primarily a gesture of thanks for work well and truly carried_out in the past never have so many millions of people been driven from their native lands as the case is today the great majority of these are to be found in other continents than the one to which our own_country belongs they are people from countries situated far away countries of which we know very little if we wanted to we could so easily close the portals of our senses and the road to our hearts one particular group of refugees on which the attention of the world was focused some years_ago as a result of newspaper reportage pictures and tv programmes comprises the so_called boat people escaping across the sea in the waters off south east asia we read with satisfaction that our sea captains gave orders to heave to whenever these wretched people were encountered in their leaky craft take them on board and transport them to some harbour they did not choose the easy way out closing their eyes and sailing past they acted according to the moral law of the sea you are not allowed to sail past men women and children in peril on the sea abandoning them to the perils of wind and wave to hunger and thirst to pirates and sharks on the occasion of this prize award the question we ought to put to ourselves is as follows is one law valid at sea another law or no law at all in operation on land for all of us the award of the prize this year is one of the very few occasions on which one and the same organisation will be receiving the nobel peace_prize for the second time the first time this occurred was in 1955 but on both occasions the norwegian_nobel committee made its decision in accord with a tradition that has roots going far back in time before the second_world war in 1938 the nobel peace_prize was awarded to the nansen_office which had been established by the league of nations this office bore the name of the norwegian fridtjof_nansen the bold polar explorer scientist statesman and humanitarian a man who looms large in the history of his own_country after the first world war he decided to devote his life and his energy first and foremost to international humanitarian aid for people in distress or suffering privation in the first place refugees and people who had been driven from various countries for this work he was awarded the nobel peace_prize in 1922 for countless homeless people people deprived of legal rights the so_called nansen passport provided a key that would open the door to a new life in a new country a strong wave of public_opinion here in norway supported nansen in his new work in admiration in pride and in a spirit of true humanitarianism in making its awards the norwegian_nobel committee is never swayed by the hope of maximum popularity and general approval it must never act under pressure from public_opinion or from any form of political pressure it is independent of all authorities and its duty is to arrive_at its decision in accordance_with its best judgment and conviction nevertheless in making its award for 1981 as in 1955 and as in 1938 the committee has done so in the certainty that in this instance it enjoyed the support of a tradition in our people which can truly be called a living tradition a tradition of this kind however among our people and in other countries is a flame which must be kept alive if it is not to die down when a flood of refugees has ebbed away it is tempting to slacken in one's efforts to provide aid and relief the next flood arises making the same demands on our conscience and on our willingness to make sacrifices it is easy to be seized by feelings of helplessness and fatalism what we may ask is the use of all this let_us cultivate our own garden and the prosaic questions arise can we afford it have we room but even if there is plenty of room in our hearts there may be a shortage of housing and of employment only on a broad international basis can effective refugee aid be organised it is precisely in situations of this kind that the norwegian_nobel committee has endeavoured to direct the attention of the world to the problem of refugees in 1938 in 1955 and now today in 1981 fridtjof nansen's humanitarian work aimed to relieve the harrowing human tragedies that resulted from the first world war and the violent upheavals that followed in its wake his work benefited a great many groups of refugees not least russians and armenians during the decade that ensued the nansen_office made a substantial contribution to the solution or alleviation of the problems facing these refugees this work was continued throughout the 1930s new categories of refugees arose but gradually interest in their problem lapsed after 1933 however a new and frightening series of problems arose this time involving first and foremost the stream of political and jewish refugees fleeing from national socialist germany there is hardly a single country in europe our own included in which we are able today with the best conscience in the world to review our conduct during these years when a new stream of refugees knocked at our doors fear of competition in the labour market mingled with reluctance and hostility of various kinds towards these new strangers faced with this situation the norwegian_nobel committee considered it right and proper to rouse feelings of conscience and responsibility by awarding the peace_prize to the nansen_office which was now faced with fresh tasks today we can only state in the light of what then happened that this was in the eleventh hour in the twilight of world peace when the second_world war came to an end in 1945 europe was strewn with human flotsam and jetsam millions of prisoners of war slave labourers displaced homeless people many of them living in camps or wandering desperately around the task of caring for these so_called displaced_persons was one that fell to the allied military authorities and to the united_nations relief and rehabilitation_administration it was no easy matter to separate the refugees from the mass of displaced_persons and we know today that many refugees against their will and without further investigation were forcibly returned to the country in which they had lived there to face an extremely uncertain future for the years that followed right up to the time of the establishment of the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees in 1951 we are today in a position to state that major refugee problems were solved thanks to the work of governments international organisations such as the provisional iro international refugee organisation and voluntary organisations millions of refugees and displaced_persons found a home and work in european and overseas countries the same relief work also covered the new stream of postwar refugees in europe fleeing from east to west for refugees outside europe special relief organisations were set_up for arab refugees from palestine and for refugees in korea when the office of the high_commissioner for refugees was set_up in 1951 a great many governments expressed their reluctance and doubts in their opinion the work of caring for refugees could now be left to governments and voluntary organisations these they confidently believed could cope with the problems the office of the high_commissioner for refugees was almost still born a large majority voted in favour of the proposal in the united_nations general_assembly that the office should be established with a view to functioning for three years during these years it was in receipt of a very limited contribution from the united_nations budget between us 600,000 and us 700,000 and it was expressly forbidden to solicit governments and organisations for voluntary contributions unless this had been sanctioned in advance by the general_assembly in 1953 the general_assembly voted to extend the life of the office of the high_commissioner to january 1 1959 its future however was still uncertain during these years refugee problems in europe were numerically not so overwhelming as to convince everyone of the need for an institution under the auspices of the united_nations this was the position when the norwegian_nobel committee in 1955 decided to give the prize to the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees it was not awarded in gratitude for work carried_out it was given with a view to emphasising that the work must be continued so that one would be ready to meet new refugee problems on the basis of the principles of humanitarianism and international justice on which the office was built hardly a year after this award of the prize europe was the scene of an as yet unforeseen flood of refugees as two hundred_thousand hungarians escaped across the border in october 1956 and the following months at the same_time a major refugee_problem was developing on the african continent as a result of the war in algeria the tasks taken on by the high_commissioner's office are a direct forerunner of the new situation that arose in the course of the 1960s and 1979s and in which we are involved at present the refugee_problem was no_longer first and foremost a european problem but had become a global problem and appropriately the year 1960 was proclaimed world refugee year today a quarter of a century after the event looking back at the prize award in 1955 we can safely say that the women and men who at that time comprised the norwegian_nobel committee were not devoid of foresight and realism but it was no easy task in 1955 to find general acceptance for this view the high_commissioner poul hartling who is present in the university festival hall here_today in order to receive nobel's peace_prize on_behalf of the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees expressed himself as follows when the committee in october informed him of their decision i_am happy and honoured to receive the prize on_behalf of all refugees for us in the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees this means that the voices of the world's many millions of refugees have been heard and understood in 1955 the then high_commissioner expressed himself in similar terms in both cases they presented a correct picture of the committee's purpose in making these awards a question that was discussed in the committee in 1955 and which was then raised in the public and critical debate on this decision was whether it was right to award the prize to an organisation that carried_out the duties with which it had been entrusted as a result of a resolution passed in the general_assembly of the united_nations it was dependent on the aid granted by governments willing to support this work and not all of them were and it received advice from these governments frequently and to an increasing extent during the decades after 1955 it was forced to resort to diplomacy and make itself inconspicuous on occasions where others could assert their opinions the status of the office of the high_commissioner provided great opportunities but also entailed limitations it would not have been difficult in 1955 to pick good candidates for a prize awarded in order to direct world attention to the fate of refugees and to the work of assisting them there were statesmen and politicians who had made bold moves in order to help refugees generally or to assist particular groups of refugees there had been heads of state who had shown generosity and hospitality there were the many voluntary organisations that had carried on over many years self denying energetic and patient relief work but prompting the committee's choice and the reasons it gave at the time a definite line of thought can be glimpsed it harboured a vision of a world community in which the respect for man and human_rights on which all refugee work must inevitably be based would succeed in achieving universal recognition and validity a utopia a great many people might say in 1981 just as much as in 1955 but this attitude also runs as a leitmotif throughout the practical and realistic political work undertaken to solve urgent tasks more quickly and more efficiently and in both its visionary and realistic form this attitude is linked as a symbol and an instrument to the united_nations in discussions on the urgent and difficult refugee problems that arose in the distant 1930s in this country as well as in other countries experts in international_law maintained that the right to asylum was not a refugee's right to asylum but the right of the individual nation to provide asylum and refuse extradition to the country from which the person concerned had fled to what extent and in what way a government wished to exercise its right of asylum depended on legislation political climate and the fundamental ideals of one's own_country according to international_law it was under no obligation to practise universal rules in the interwar years too governments entered_into agreements and undertook obligations in this sphere but after the second_world war the attempt was made to achieve a breakthrough and this resulted in the drafting of a convention related to the status of refugees it was drawn_up in connection with the establishment of the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees in 1951 and came into force in 1954 it established the right to asylum as a right enjoyed by the refugee in the land in which he was staying no refugee could be handed over to a country in which his life or freedom was in danger on the grounds of his race his religion his nationality his social group or his political opinions the convention also establishes his rights as well as his obligations in the land that grants him asylum it goes a step further by establishing in addition his social and economic rights which will enable him to build a new and independent existence and to be integrated as an individual on equal terms with others in the community in which he is now living new provisions have subsequently been added to the convention by no means all governments have subscribed to the convention or felt themselves bound by its provisions but their number is growing markedly among all the nations of the world outside europe and north america in a convention which in 1969 was adopted by the organisation of african states on special aspects of the refugee_problem in africa it was firmly established that the convention of 1951 is the basic and universal document where the status of refugees is concerned the two peace prizes which in the course of a quarter of a century have been awarded to the office of the high_commissioner are therefore not merely a recognition of far_reaching work carried_out by the office in full agreement with governments and in collaboration with many other international and national organisations both government controlled and voluntary these awards were justified by the resolution of the general_assembly of the united_nations governing the high_commissioner's office and by the convention on the rights of refugees they represent both a symbol and a practical instrument in the long_term work carried_out to ensure that the fundamental_principles for this refugee work will achieve universal recognition and validity this was the line of thought that inspired the committee of 1955 and the committee in 1981 has been no stranger to this approach today a total of ten_million refugees has been registered for the whole world we know that in reality the number is greatly in excess of this conservative estimates put it at fourteen to eighteen millions only at one point of time were the figures higher before the ten_million refugees in bangladesh were able to return when their country achieved independence in 1972 other major refugee problems too have been solved wholly or partly during the last two decades here the high_commissioner's office has participated often playing a vital role but one flood of refugees has replaced another and the number is on the increase the majority are no_longer to be found in europe but in asia africa and latin_america half the registered refugees are in africa but in asia a new overwhelming refugee_problem has arisen as a result of the war in afghanistan well over two million afghans have sought refuge in pakistan a developing country which without the assistance of international organisations is not in a position to tackle the problem involved in caring for these refugees as yet we can see no solution to the problem that their future entails according to the terms defining the work of the high_commissioner's office as its commencement in 1951 its primary task was to provide economic and social help the so_called stateless refugees still remaining in europe were to be given the legal and diplomatic protection which the governments in the countries from which they had fled could not or would not give them the high_commissioner's office in fact assumed the protective role which is normally the lot of governments in relation to their citizens the most_important task was now to find a final solution to the refugee_problem this would involve either the refugees voluntarily returning to the land from which they came or their being fully integrated with the population of the country to which they had fled or that they would be allowed to emigrate overseas all this demanded a great_deal of diplomatic cooperation with and urgent appeals to a great many governments it is impossible in the time at my disposal to enumerate all the categories and groups of refugees which exist in the world in this year of 1981 and not even in the nobel lecture of the high_commissioner tomorrow will there be room for them all the list is a very long one this is also true of the states which have received refugees and helped to solve their problems and the same is true of the list of countries in which conditions have been such that people have fled beyond their borders as far as a great many of these groups are concerned the work of the high_commissioner's office is of a traditional nature but the very magnitude of the floods of refugees has necessitated a fundamental revision of the working methods of the high_commissioner's office and an extension of its sphere of activity when hundreds of thousands or even a million people come pouring across the borders the first urgent task is to provide the aid needed in order to safeguard their lives and health we have all read accounts and seen pictures of families in desperate flight and of the camps where they have suffered from shortage of water food shelter and the most elementary medical care most refugees have made their way to poor countries incapable with their own resources of rescuing them and caring for them it is here that the aid given by international organisations is directed this must be done rapidly often with improvised means and the difficulties involved are so great that this work inevitably lays itself open to criticism it has been the task of the high_commissioner's office and voluntary organisations to be prepared to face constantly new situations and to ensure that the experience gathered from one crisis is not irretrievably lost before the next one crops up this involves not least people fleeing from war and chaos in their homeland these may be wars that constitute various stages in the discontinuance of colonial rule or wars between newly created states they may be civil wars or wars of secession in which ethnic groups are frequently opposed to one another or again there may be conditions of anarchy in which large sections of the population are bereft of all security and safeguards for life and property these conditions will often result in widespread famine and occasionally it may be difficult to establish which catastrophes are the work of the natural elements and which are the work of man the great bulk of refugees hope to be able to return to their land of origin refugees fleeing from countries struggling or at war with colonial powers have returned once independence has been achieved this was true of the refugees from the war in algeria which was to comprise a turning point in the activities of the high_commissioner's office in the 1970s yet more hundreds of thousands have returned to the one time portuguese colonies this has also been the case in zimbabwe after the cessation of white colonial rule in bangladesh too repatriation was the obvious solution after secessionary wars this ensued too after the civil war or secessionary war in sudan had been concluded with an amicable compromise settlement in this case the return of the refugees also involved what has been called internal refugees people who have fled from their homes and sought refuge in remote areas within the boundaries of their native land the aid that had been made available for the refugees was continued in order to assist them to return and rebuild their lives after resettlement the decision on the part of refugees to return home may of course be an expression of the resignation and desperation provoked by their life as refugees this may be true of refugees today returning to ethiopia or to laos and cambodia in such cases the important task is to assist them materially and if possible to protect them against persecution but the high_commissioner's office has maintained the fundamental principle that no refugee must be repatriated against his or her will or under any form of coercion whatever and in cases where this has taken_place it has been in direct violation of the wishes of the high_commissioner's office there are also refugees who have little or no hope of ever being able to return to the land from which they came or at any_rate not unless this were made possible as a result of a war conducted against the government in their land of origin this applies in africa e.g to refugees from rwanda and burundi in such cases the expulsion of ethnic groups rather_than flight may be involved many of these and other refugees in africa have been assisted to start a new life in the adjoining countries to which they have fled often but by no means always refugees have been received with hospitality on the other side of the border by a population belonging to the same ethnic group in other respects too there are grounds for expressing our profound gratitude for the hospitality that a large number of african states have shown many of these refugees have been given grants of land to cultivate and tanzania has set an excellent example by giving over 30,000 refugees full citizen rights the opportunities for permanent settlement in the host country are far more limited in south and southeast asia where there is a shortage of land and extreme population density the settling of ten_million refugees from bangladesh in the indian border areas was never a feasible proposition special historical reasons made it possible for 700,000 refugees from vietnam laos and cambodia to be granted asylum in western countries in the first place in the united_states but also in france and a number of other countries in the 1980s however there will be limits to the number of refugees from asia and africa who can be received and integrated in the industrial countries economic crises and unemployment have created a situation very different from the one obtaining in the 1950s and 1960s this also applies to refugees who are more difficult to integrate than is the case with refugees in postwar europe dealing as it does with a great many governments whose cooperation is desirable in many cases as well governments in the countries from which the refugees come the high_commissioner's office has had to make use of diplomatic channels it has been in a position to offer what might be called its good offices as arbitrator and go between in relations_between governments with different interests to safeguard but throughout this activity consideration for the refugees themselves and their fate has been inevitably the one and only guiding principle we may well entertain a vision of a world without refugees a world in which men and women are never in jeopardy on account of their religion their nationality their political views or their membership of any group of a world in which people need never flee from war and civil strife but this is not the sort of world in which we live we can so easily be seized by despair or cynicism by the wish to cultivate our own garden and to be sufficient unto ourselves in the years that lie_ahead too we shall encounter men and women on the run it is beyond the capacity of mankind to predict where and when new refugee problems will arise but we possess the fundamental ideas on human_rights and a sense of fellow feeling that goes beyond countries and continents religions cultures and racial borders we live in a world community of states as reflected in the united_nations but we are living too in the world community of men and women many of them men and women who are stateless the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees is a bridge linking the world community conceived as a community of states and the world community conceived as a community of men and women we have a duty to the refugees and this is a duty to ourselves and the very basis of our own existence we thank the office of the united_nations high_commissioner for refugees for all it has done for countless refugees and we should like to express the hope that in the troubled times that may lie_ahead the high_commissioner's office will carry the flaming torch that fridtjof_nansen once lit in our country and in other countries and that the office will turn to us again and again and challenge us to do our duty translation your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen people occasionally ask whether the task of nominating peace_prize winners may not prove a difficult one it is certainly not difficult to understand the reasoning prompting this sort of question naturally a peace_prize committee too is bound to feel a sense of affliction at the setbacks suffered by the cause of peace great is our disappointment every time national_boundaries are violated and naked force of arms unleashed one knows the feeling of despair at the news that innocent people are being killed and old enmity rekindled the world in which we live is not at peace tensions and unresolved disputes are dominant features of our age despite disarmament conferences and other verbal endeavours to promote peace the armaments race continues military budgets merely mount up and have today reached a level of close to 65 billion dollars annually nuclear armaments are the cause of deepest concern with these weapons the killing power of the super powers appears to have reached its maximum potential the extermination of the human race there are in short ample grounds for pessimism in our time but as one of this_year's laureates has declared giving up is not human and it is in fact from the ranks of people imbued precisely with such ideas that the norwegian_nobel committee has this year made its choice alva_myrdal and alfonso garcía robles have in the opinion of the committee proved outstanding candidates for two reasons in the first place owing to their magnificent work in the disarmament negotiations of the united_nations where they have both played crucial roles and won international recognition and secondly because too they have made such a notable contribution to the task of informing world opinion on the problems of armaments and of arousing the acceptance by the general public of their joint responsibility for the train of events in awarding nobel's peace_prize to these two the committee_wishes to focus attention on what despite the many gloomy prospects nevertheless constitutes a bright spot there are people who are not satisfied merely to draw_attention to alarming trends but who also devote their energy and their ability to turning the tide pessimism and anxiety for the future have failed to unnerve a few hardy souls who are endeavouring to convey the message that the fate of mankind has by no means been finally sealed and that the nuclear holocaust is not the only possible outcome of the conflicts and disputes we face the climate of public_opinion for peace and disarmament initiated in the western world is on the march and is now thrusting its way across many national_boundaries the idea of calling a halt to the nuclear armaments race is no_longer quite so impossible leading politicians on both_sides of the atlantic have grasped its sense of deep commitment and are giving it their support it may well be a sign of the times that during the recent elections to congress and the senate in the usa there was a substantial majority in a number of states in favour of freezing nuclear armaments at their present level the leaders of public opinions for peace and disarmament in the west know to their chagrin what a poor hearing they command in the east but even here too they are not without their allies of which maybe the most_important is the common fear of total extermination in a nuclear war a fear which we may assume is felt just as forcibly over there as in our part of the world after all overriding all conflicting_interests there exists a common interest in survival nevertheless under no circumstances would it be human to give up and this is precisely the keynote of the message we have received from this_year's peace_prize winners alva myrdal's commitment to the service of disarmament has long since established her international reputation the many awards and other marks of high honour she has received testify to her standing in the international community her commitment moreover reveals a tremendous span both in terms of time and spheres of interest as far back as the 1930s she played a prominent part in developing the modern swedish welfare state she was a staunch champion of women's liberation and equal rights she has proved a brilliant diplomat and was the first woman to be appointed head of a department in the united_nations on an occasion like this it is only right and proper that a norwegian_nobel committee should recall her fearless and notable work on_behalf of norway during the second_world war for this she was deservedly awarded his majesty king haakon vii's freedom cross alva_myrdal belongs to the world community but she is ideologically firmly rooted in nordic constitutional principles and in our democratic ideals these were the ideals that motivated her when she acted as head of delegation during the disarmament negotiations in geneva nor is that all in other un contexts too she has been a staunch spokesman of peace and disarmament as a researcher and disarmament expert with a wide knowledge of the problems of world politics she has commanded attention in the international forum and not least in her literary work where her influence has been profound it is no_doubt typical of great personalities that it is easy both to agree and disagree with them alva_myrdal is hardly an exception to this rule but on one point all will agree her name has become a rallying point for men and women who still cling to the belief that in the last resort mind is bound to triumph over matter today in her eighty first year she can look_back on a life which must of necessity have been not only rich but also dramatic it must have alternated between hope and disappointment and almost certainly too between encouragement and discouragement so much the greater on such occasions the joy of witnessing the fruits of one's labour heralding the consummation of the dream conceived in the finest moment of life in this connection it might be fitting to recall bjornstjerne bjornson's words all that your hopes have illumined all that your fears have bedewed now grows apace for obvious reasons alfonso garcía robles is less well_known in the nordic countries but as we all know a considerable part of the world is situated outside the north and in international disarmament work garcía robles bears a name that is truly illustrious he was the driving_force behind the agreement signed in mexico city in 1967 that declared latin_america a denuclearised zone and in view of the fact that the wording of this treaty is so markedly the work of garcia robles it gives us at the same_time a very fair description of the man and his way of thinking the outstanding feature of this agreement the first of its kind in the world is a realistic view of the destructive power inherent in nuclear_arms the starting_point for the agreement that was reached is a clear recognition that nuclear_arms are in essence not defensive weapons but weapons of self destruction they are to quote the words of the agreement an attack on the integrity of the human race and could in the final resort even render the world uninhabitable it has rightly been maintained that the first essential condition required for the solution of political problems is the moral courage to look these problems in the face frequently this is precisely what is lacking and this is maybe particularly applicable to the problem of nuclear_arms it is such a temptation to shut one's eyes it is as though the process of comprehension were obstructed we are not in a position to pursue our own reasoning to its logical conclusion at some point or other we recoil lacking the courage to know what we actually know the truth concerning the situation that has been created by modern nuclear_weapons is so horrifying that in a way it numbs our ability to comprehend it the american social economist and author professor john kenneth galbraith has expressed this in the following words the truth that men seek there to evade is that this small planet cannot survive a nuclear exchange asked if we want life for our children and grandchildren we affirm that we do asked about nuclear war the greatest threat to that life we regularly dismiss it from mind man has learned to live with the thought of his own mortality and he now has accommodated to the thought that all may die that his children and grandchildren will not exist it's a capacity for accommodation at which we can only marvel i suspect that our minds accept the thought but do not embrace the reality the act of imagination is too great or too awful our minds can extend to a war in some distant jungle and set in motion the actions that reject it but not yet to the nuclear holocaust a commitment to this reality is now the supreme test of our politics it is in the light of this that we should consider the agreement that declared latin_america a denuclearised zone alfonso garcía robles has rightly been called the father of the mexico agreement it is his ideas and his realistic assessment that are reflected in the wording he is one of those people who possess the courage to face the truth of the situation created by nuclear_arms and it is precisely for this reason too that the successful negotiation of the agreement redounds so very much to his credit once the horrific truth about nuclear_arms is recognised the question of nuclear armament likewise acquires a fresh dimension it is no_longer a question of being for or against national defence or an international system of security the development of nuclear_arms has taken us well beyond this stage in the argument as everyone knows there are today divided opinions on the justification of military defence many of us believe in the light of what history has taught_us that a credible defence of freedom independence and humanity must in fact be regarded as the defence of peace others adopt a more or less consistent pacifist attitude what the mexico agreement however so clearly demonstrates is that we can no_longer continue our argument on this level the matter has acquired a fresh perspective we must seek a way out so that mankind can survive this is the real disarmament problem facing us today this has provided a platform on which all mankind will have to come together irrespective of political views or strategic considerations the alternative is a continued nuclear build_up and the proliferation of nuclear_arms which can only lead ultimately to a catastrophe man was once told blessed are the peacemakers for they shall inherit the earth today we know that if the peacemakers fail in their efforts there will be no one left to inherit the earth an earth moreover no one would consider it worthwhile inheriting putting this truth across has been and still is the prime concern of this_year's peace_prize winners what they have clearly shown us too is that the work of promoting peace and disarmament must be carried on at several levels it is vital to spread information on the issue involved so that a growing body of public_opinion capable of exerting pressure can be built up but this is not the only object as alva_myrdal has explained we must dare to believe that in their heart of hearts men desire peace on earth but we shall never achieve this merely by coining slogans such as we want peace our aim must be backed by intense efforts to find constructive proposals the challenge facing peace workers is not to be found in a single universal question and answer but in peaceful solutions to a host of conflicts and in the exertion to achieve peace on many different levels this is precisely what the two peace_prize winners have confirmed in their endeavours they know better than most people what it means to make intense efforts to find constructive proposals they have sought no facile short cuts because they know how vital it is that negotiations on disarmament should be conducted on the basis of down to earth realism and on the assumption of give and take between the great_powers and it is precisely in this connection when we mention the concept of give and take that we get some notion of how complicated and exhaustive the problem of disarmament is it is not sufficient merely to demonstrate a desire for peace nor is it sufficient simply to declare that nuclear_arms must be done away with there is no difficulty in getting a wide measure of agreement on aims of this kind difficulty arises when these aims are to be realised through the medium of practical political decisions and this too is a problem we must have the courage to face up to we have watched with growing impatience how difficult it is for the nuclear powers to reach agreement on even the most modest measures of disarmament and we may well ask why it has not been possible to make any progress with all the negotiations that have been conducted maybe the ideological differences are too great maybe it is impossible to break through the barrier of mutual mistrust which unfortunately has received far too much nourishment is it once_again fear that dominates and dictates the premises on which global political decisions are made it is not easy to give a simple answer maybe this too is a fact we shall have to take into account but what we can all see is that a power struggle and intense rivalry are being waged between the great_powers in this struggle there are several parties who believe that they are compelled to safeguard vital interests and who are genuinely afraid of jeopardising the security of their country for this reason they feel compelled one and all to take military precautions it is not difficult to understand an attitude of this kind but there is also a great_deal to suggest that the big powers are caught in what has been called the symbiotic trap in which the parties concerned are mutually motivating one another to arm this is how the trap works in the east information is received to suggest that the west has plans for further rearmament and for this reason the east is compelled to arm out of consideration for its own security in the west similar information is received on new types of weapons being developed in the east and so the west is forced to react they dare not do otherwise with each side placing the blame on the other an excuse is found for justifying the arms_race the persons principally responsible for the present development are as a result of this bound to be subject to tremendous pressure in these circumstances it would be difficult to arrive_at solutions which all parties concerned would consider worthwhile and which they feel would ensure their safety very careful assessment is necessary in order to arrive_at solutions of this kind the main problem being to arrive_at a platform on which all interested parties can despite their differences come together the question now is whether the fresh situation that has been created by the nuclear powers might not be capable of providing a platform of this kind since no one can any longer be in any doubt that today a joint interest overshadowing all else exists for all the nations of the world viz to put a stop to the nuclear_arms race this is the problem overshadowing all others to which we must turn our gaze and in our endeavours to reach this goal all our efforts must and can be coordinated it is in the light of this that we can observe two clear lines emerging in the work of disarmament we have the meticulous work demanding a great_deal of patience and time that is carried on through international negotiations for mutual disarmament and it should be emphasised that it is along this line that lasting and real results can be achieved but we have in addition the work of the various peace movements consciously committed to creating a body of public_opinion and it must also be emphasised that if this body of opinion is allowed to grow in strength and health reaching out across still more national_boundaries it could constitute a decisive factor in ensuring the success of international negotiations the way ahead may appear long and difficult and it certainly makes great demands both on the imagination and the patience and maybe above_all on the unflinching honesty which dares to look truth in the face and still has the courage to continue in awarding this_year's peace_prize to alva_myrdal and garcía robles the norwegian_nobel committee_wishes to express its recognition of the intense endeavours undertaken by two people to find constructive solutions to difficult international disarmament negotiations at the same_time the committee is anxious and in this connection we believe we are speaking in the spirit of the prizewinners that the peace_prize this year should be interpreted as well as a helping_hand to that body of public_opinion for the promotion of peace and disarmament to which they themselves have proved such a valuable inspiration your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom justice and peace in the world thus begins the text of the united_nations declaration of human_rights a declaration which with its definition of the concept of peace forms the basis of the norwegian_nobel committee's decision to award this_year's peace_prize to the polish trade_union leader lech_walesa the campaign for human_rights is necessarily an inseparable part of the struggle for peace the selection of a peace_prize winner on these grounds is not new laureates such as the south_african albert_lutuli martin_luther king from the u.s.a andrei_sakharov from the u.s.s.r and the argentinian adolfo_pérez esquivel received their awards on just these grounds the committee believes that this_year's prize_winner can justly take his place among this gathering of campaigners for human_rights consideration of the question of human_rights raises the well_known problem why does humanity advance so slowly it has however become more generally recognised that a peace which is won and defended through the violation of human_rights is a peace which neither can nor ought to be permanent the present generation has perhaps learned this in a way no previous generation experienced military occupation and foreign domination together with the associated evils of physical and mental terror have led more and more people to understand the great truth that freedom and life are one peace is created where people live and breathe in freedom and where one does as one would be done by we can assume that such thoughts lie behind the united_nations declaration of human_rights which the world community has adopted as the basis for peaceful coexistence between peoples and nations for the norwegian_nobel committee it was a natural development to consider the peace_prize in the light of this declaration through the presentation of this_year's award the committee once_again draws the attention of the world community to its own definition of the concept of peace it follows from this that the committee's deliberations and decisions are necessarily independent of national and political boundaries the guidelines given to the committee in alfred_nobel's will stipulate that the presentation of the peace_prize is the responsibility of the committee alone and cannot be influenced by outside forces thus the nobel peace_prize can never be more or less_than a hand stretched out to individuals or groups who give expression to the longing for peace and freedom felt by all the peoples of the world wherever they live we believe that it is in the spirit of alfred_nobel's legacy that the peace_prize should be a gesture of solidarity with those_who in the service of peace campaign for humanity's highest ideals human_dignity is an important concept in this connection the phrase has two central connotations firstly that the dignity of humanity is inviolable and secondly that each and every human being has the same everlasting value a natural corollary of this is that we all have a common duty to defend human_dignity all thoughts of solidarity even the command to love one another have their foundation here human_dignity is humanity's shared possession a possession which we all have both a part in and a responsibility for we are bound together in a common lot which makes it impossible for us to be unaffected by the fate of others another nobel prize_winner ernest hemingway opens one of his novels with a famous quotation from the english poet john donne which illustrates this point with an almost shocking clarity no man is an island intire of its self every man is a piece of the continent a part of the maine if a clod bee washed away by the sea europe is the lesse as well as if a promontorie were as well as if a mannor of thy friends or of thine owne were any mans death diminishes me because i_am involved in mankinde and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee this is the way in which we ought to experience humanity's oneness any man's death diminishes me every brother being in chains is my shame every longing for freedom which is suppressed every human right which is violated is a personal defeat for me because we are united in human kind and share one another's fate up from this ideal of human oneness this_year's prize_winner has raised a burning torch a shining name the name of solidarity he has lifted the torch unarmed the word the spirit and the thought of freedom and human_rights were his weapons and as is so often the case the struggle involved great personal sacrifice even_though the object was something as simple as the workers right to establish their own organisations this is a right which again is confirmed in the world community's declaration of human_rights the norwegian_nobel committee has evaluated lech_walesa's contribution in this field as being of essential importance in the campaign to establish the universal freedom of organisation in all countries it is in just this context that the name solidarity has its deepest and most wide ranging meaning lech_walesa's contribution is more_than a domestic polish concern the solidarity for which he is spokesman is an expression of precisely the concept of being at one with humanity therefore he belongs to us all the world has heard his voice and understood his message the nobel peace_prize is merely a confirmation of this lech_walesa has made the name solidarity more_than an expression of the unity of a group campaigning for special interests solidarity has come to represent the determination to resolve conflicts and obliterate disagreement through peaceful negotiation where all involved meet with a mutual respect for one another's integrity conflicts and disagreements can be various and can lead to many different reactions those involved will inevitably be faced with complicated decisions this was the situation one august day in 1980 when lech_walesa climbed over the steel fence of the lenin yards in gdansk took the microphone and at a stroke became the leader of polish solidarity he was faced with overwhelming difficulties the choice of strategy was not easy the goal was clear enough the workers right to organise and the right to negotiate with the country's officials on the workers social and economic situation but which of the many available paths would lead him to this goal this is not the occasion to evaluate the political situation lech_walesa found himself in suffice it to say that it was difficult more interesting to us now is the fact that walesa's chosen strategy was that of peace and negotiation and as always in such situations the willingness to negotiate implied the willingness to compromise here because it was obvious that the opponent was also fighting adverse conditions both economic and political solidarity came to represent as a result of a mobilisation of the national will the so_called polish social opposition the possibility of a solidarity of opinion in the whole nation this was not an opposition which involved the use of physical power rather it was a question of a spiritual or intellectual power which because of its universal acceptance in the populace would permeate the system and dissolve conflicts from within by following this peaceful course without resorting to violence solidarity became a rapidly expanding movement the courage which lech_walesa showed in stepping forward openly and unarmed was overwhelmingly rewarded by the millions of polish workers and farmers who joined him in his struggle thus in awarding the peace_prize to lech_walesa today the committee_wishes it not only to be seen as a token of respect but also as an expression of gratitude for the peaceful courage he showed when choosing his course that walesa and the movement he leads are in keeping with the highest of human ideals is confirmed not least by the close connections which have existed between solidarity and the polish church this interdependence is based not on common political interests but rather on an ideological unity in the perception of human value and human_rights it has not escaped the committee's notice that the polish church which is a popular church in a way that few european churches are has been so consistent in its support of lech_walesa this has given solidarity an invaluable moral strength one has great expectations of the role the church can come to play in polish society given its standing among the people as outsiders we are particularly aware of the way in which solidarity also through its attachment to the church has shown its willingness for peace and reconciliation we have seen them gather in their tens of thousands in and around the churches in prayer for their land and cause we have seen them water with their tears the wreaths of the victims of the fight for freedom and we have understood that their unarmed battle is a battle they fight not only for their own sake but also for all liberty loving people the world over it is in this perspective that the norwegian_nobel committee has seen lech_walesa's contribution the way he chose was the way of negotiation peace and reconciliation in the world we live in it is shockingly clear that détente and the peaceful resolution of conflicts is more necessary than ever before we have seen too much of what the brutal use of power can lead to if history has taught_us anything it is that the use of violence and power can in the long_run only mobilise the powers of death unfortunately we have also learned that the voice of history does_not always tell of victory for humanity and peace it is pertinent to ask whether idealistic and morally sound attitudes do in fact have any chance of success this question can of course also be raised in the case of lech_walesa true enough it would be strange if the causes he represents did not succeed if only in the long_run he was not a political trouble maker his concerns were rather the polish workers interests and current demands but such demands are not always successful even when they are as justified as they are in lech_walesa's case no lech_walesa raised no revolutionary banner and espoused no other weapon than the peaceful strike weapon which is recognised by the world community neither did he claim support from the declarations of human_rights emanating from the united_nations and the helsinki agreement he wished only to negotiate two things alone were of pressing interest the workers social conditions and their right to negotiate the background to this singlemindedness was the simple fact that these rights were not recognised this had led to outbreaks of universal bitterness on several occasions previously in 1956 in 1970 and so again in 1980 all of these outbreaks were concerned with precisely these problems social conditions freedom of expression and the right to organise one can reasonably wonder why it should be so difficult to achieve recognition for such aims those_who know but a little of the history of the international labour movement will be aware that such difficulties have always been present it is still remarkable however that working people's elementary rights can be denied irrespective of to which ideology or economic system the respective countries belong one ought perhaps to be able to believe that there are boundaries behind which it is not necessary to campaign for workers rights such boundaries obviously don't exist it is clear that although lech_walesa primarily campaigned for elementary social rights without challenging the established power structure his campaign had inevitable political and ideological overtones his campaign has also been necessarily a campaign for human_rights and as such inevitably interpreted as an obstruction against the system by the political authorities as the political opposition to solidarity grew its own consciousness of standing for humanity and human_rights became clearer it became increasingly obvious that lech_walesa's campaign for workers rights was from the very beginning a contribution to the general campaign for human_rights in the world this connection was emphasised more and more especially by intellectual groups within the movement and also by the polish church campaigners for human_rights independent of where in the world they have lived and worked have always had one common problem how can the idealistic goal be realised when one is obliged at the same_time to take into account the practical possibilities in the given situation is it wise to moderate demands and campaign for a step by step improvement this problem faced lech_walesa was a cautious course with the possibility of gaining some ground the right one or should one risk and stand to loose everything it is impossible to understand the polish solidarity movement without being aware of this problem a realistic evaluation of the existing situation would suggest that the best course was to aim for a combination of the existing one party government with a social pluralism which permitted the freedom to organise and negotiate at any_rate in the future such a solution was the first negotiating model we know now that even this moderate strategy failed solidarity is today a forbidden organisation the negotiations and the strikes which were designed to emphasise the seriousness of the negotiations led to the state of emergency and the arrest and imprisonment of lech_walesa and even_though the state of emergency is rescinded and walesa is freed his freedom is limited his own evaluation of the situation has not permitted him to be present here_today the peace_prize laureate's seat is empty it won't be his voice we hear let_us therefore try even harder to listen to the silent speech from his empty place at the present time lech_walesa cannot be presented as a victor at the end of a struggle full of sacrifice his chosen course was not as short and easy as that and it could seem that the goals he set himself are just as distant still but is lech_walesa really silent today is he completely without victory has his cause suffered defeat many are of the opinion that his voice has never been stronger and reached further than it does now the electrician from gdansk the carpenter's son from the vistula valley has managed to lift the banner of freedom and humanity so high that the whole world can once_again see it the power of his belief and vision is unweakened his actions have become a chapter in the history of international labour and the future will recognise his name among those_who contributed to humanity's legacy of freedom once_again the stone rejected by the builder has become a cornerstone this time a cornerstone in the building of freedom and democracy which humanity with varying degrees of success is attempting to raise in our world it is in any case certain that lech_walesa's efforts have an important message for our times it is the committee's opinion that he stands as an inspiration and a shining example to all those_who under different conditions fight for freedom and humanity if in a future which we hope is not too distant there should again be attempted a compromise between the polish authorities and the country's workers and farmers lech_walesa's participation will be both necessary and indispensable for he is a victor in the eyes of the ordinary worker or farm labourer he is a victor in the eyes of the people and their church and he is one of the great spokesmen in the world today for the longing for freedom that can never be silenced lech_walesa has made humanity bigger and more inviolable his ambivalent good fortune is that he has won a victory which is not of this our political world the presentation of the peace_prize to him today is a homage to the power of victory which abides in one person's belief in his vision and in his courage to follow his call your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee_wishes through the presentation of this_year's nobel peace_prize to direct attention to a unifying leader figure in the campaign to solve south africa's apartheid problem by peaceful_means the situation as it is today is such that a peaceful_solution is by no means inevitable the repression is so brutal that a violent rebellion would be an understandable reaction the south_african has more reason now than ever before to exclaim cry the beloved country given this situation it is all the more remarkable that human_beings are able to choose a peaceful way to freedom it is the nobel_committee's opinion that the means by which the south_african liberation process is conducted will have wide ranging consequences for the whole of the african continent and therefore also for the cause of peace in the world this is an opinion which is also expressed in a number of united_nations resolutions most recently that passed by the security_council in october this year racial_discrimination in south_africa is rightly regarded as a threat to peace and as an outrageous violation of basic human_rights fortunately a peaceful alternative exists on a broad front a campaign is being fought with the weapons of the spirit and reason a campaign for truth freedom and justice in recognition of the fact that it is this alternative which must succeed the south_african bishop desmond_tutu has been selected as this_year's peace_prize laureate the contribution he has made and is still making represents a hope for the future for the country's white minority as well as the black majority desmond_tutu is an exponent of the only form for conflict solving which is worthy of civilised nations it is today 23 years since the nobel peace_prize was last awarded to a south_african on that occasion it was albert_lutuli then president of the african_national congress who was presented with the prize it is the committee's wish that this_year's award should be seen as a renewed recognition of the courage and heroic patience shown by black south africans in their use of peaceful_means to oppose the apartheid_system this recognition is also extended to all who throughout the world stand in the forefront of the campaign for racial equality as a human right it is unfortunately not only in south_africa that human_rights are violated another former prizewinner amnesty_international informs us that it is known to occur in 117 countries and that prisoners of conscience are tortured in 60 countries too frequently the brutal features of power and violence mar the face of our times but if we are willing to look for it we can also see the face of peace even if we have to peer through prison bars and barbed wire to find it and in spite of everything new hope is raised on each occasion we see how the spirit of man refuses to be conquered by the forces of hate some time ago television enabled us to see this_year's laureate in a suburb of johannesburg a massacre of the black population had just taken_place the camera showed ruined houses mutilated human_beings and crushed children's toys innocent people had been murdered women and children mortally wounded but after the police vehicles had driven away with their prisoners desmond_tutu stood and spoke to a frightened and bitter congregation do not hate he said let_us choose the peaceful way to freedom it is with admiration and humility we today present the nobel peace_prize to this man desmond tutu's contribution to the liberation struggle was given a special significance in 1978 when he became the first black secretary of the south_african council of churches this council of churches is both a joint forum for the churches of south_africa and the national representative for the world council of churches it includes all the major churches in the country with the exception of the boer church which withdrew as a result of disagreement with the council over the question of apartheid the catholic church is a so_called associate member but is also one of the council's strongest supporters as around 75 percent of all citizens of south_africa are members of a church the body is a very representative organisation few other organisations can make the same claim to speak for the black population as the dynamic leader of this council desmond_tutu has formulated as his goal a democratic and just society without racial segregation his minimum demands are equal civil rights for all the abolition of the pass laws a common system of education and the cessation of the forced deportation of blacks from south_africa to the so_called homelands both through these objectives and through its practical activities the south_african council of churches has obviously exceeded the normal scope of such an organisation the council has become a trailblazer in the campaign for human_rights a central force in a liberation struggle and an increasingly wide ranging support organisation for the many victims of the present system's racial_discrimination consider what happens when millions of human_beings are deported their homes are razed to the ground their personal possessions are taken from them they lose their jobs and are physically transported and deposited in the empty veld with just a tent and a sack of maize as their only hopes of survival 3 millions have been deported in this way while new millions await their turn if we ignore for a moment the personal humiliation the question remains who is there to help these people to survive in their new existence who will help them house themselves find water tend to the sick or educate their children the system also has obviously its political prisoners their crime is the necessary one of wanting a society with freedom and respect for human_rights they are imprisoned but who is there to help their families there is also the so_called migration labour system under which underpaid labourers are obliged to live away from their families the pass laws are also notorious they burden the black population with a collective captivity and make them foreigners in their own_country anyone breaking these laws risks group arrest and indefinite imprisonment without legal help it is not difficult to imagine that as a result of this system there are considerable social medical and legal problems which necessitate help from the south_african council of churches it is a pleasure to note that over 90 percent of the council's budget is covered by contributions from churches in the western world while it is with anxiety we note that new laws are being prepared which will deprive the council of the right to administer its own funds as already_mentioned racial_discrimination is by no means limited to south_africa before the second_world war such discrimination was relatively common and world opinion was not particularly concerned with it the situation changed however after 1945 new ideas were expressed in the atlantic charter and the declaration of human_rights 1 during the war it was possible to see signs of a more liberal policy evolving in south_africa the ideas from the atlantic charter however had little effect there and when the nationalist party won the election of 1948 the situation worsened it was in this period that the apartheid laws were formulated and ratified a move which has correctly been described as a counter revolution against pre 1948 tendencies history is never without a certain sense for the ironic the man who more_than anyone_else was responsible for the implementation of the apartheid_system the nationalist party's first prime_minister dr daniel malan was a churchman an ordained priest in the dutch reformed church and now we see that the most dynamic opponent of the apartheid_system is also a churchman in fact a bishop in this way history corrects its own mistakes the irony of history is even more wide ranging the apartheid_system is the indirect reason for the fact that desmond_tutu became a churchman with the position he has today his first wish was to become a doctor but this was impossible with his parents financial situation he became therefore a teacher as his father had been in 1957 when the government introduced the state bantu education in many ways an abolition of education for the black population tutu felt himself driven from the teaching profession and began to study to be a priest he has himself said that he did not feel himself called to take this step by high ideals it just occurred to me that if the church would have me the profession of priest could be a good way of serving my people yes it seems that the church was willing to take him obviously desmond_tutu was not without high ideals and like so many others he had these ideals from the family home in his childhood in klerksdorp in the west rand district he was taught tolerance and sympathy he has himself said that i never learnt to hate the idealism of his parents was thus reflected in tutu's upbringing when tutu was twelve years old his family moved to johannesburg where his father was a teacher and his mother a cleaner and cook at a school for the blind here he learned sympathy for the weakest and most underprivileged it was also here that he met the man who probably exercised the strongest influence over his formative years the white priest trevor huddleston who was parish priest in the black slum of sophiatown one day says tutu i was standing in the street with my mother when a white man in a priest's clothing walked past as he passed us he took off his hat to my mother i couldn't believe my eyes a white man who greeted a black working_class woman when tutu has in later years been asked why he doesn't hate whites he usually replies that it is because he was fortunate in the whites he met when young but although he has never learnt to hate none has opposed injustice with a more burning anger courageous and fearless he opposes his country's authorities he is to be found at the front of the demonstration processions regardless of the danger to his own life his clear standpoints and his fearless attitude have made his name a unifying symbol for all groups of freedom campaigners in africa desmond_tutu has shown that to campaign for the cause of peace is not a question of silent acceptance but rather of arousing consciences and a sense of indignation strengthening the will and inspiring the human spirit so that it recognises both its own value and its power of victory to this fight for peace we give our affirmative yes today the actress liv ullmann has told of a lebanese boy who was asked if he believed in revenge yes replied the boy he believed in revenge and to revenge he was asked what is that to revenge replied the boy is to make a bad person a good person thoughts of this nature are the human spirit's bulwark against barbarism it is those_who have such thoughts who are the real peacemakers and the meek who are not only blessed but who shall also inherit the earth also the earth of south_africa the 23 million coloured people shall at least have the same right of inheritance of this earth as the 4.5 million whites the question has been raised whether the award of the peace_prize to desmond_tutu is to be seen as a judgement on the south_african apartheid_system the answer is that the system has judged itself racial_discrimination can never be anything but an expression of shameful contempt for humankind racial_discrimination used and defended as a political system is totally incompatible with human civilisation this_year's peace_prize is therefore an attempt to awaken consciences it is and has to be an illusion that privileged groups can maintain their position through repression that such things can have a place in our future is a lie which nobody should allow themselves to believe in his famous book roots the black author alex hailey tells of his african ancestor the negro slave kunta kinte who attained the position of coachman with his white master one of his duties was to drive his white masters to luxurious parties held at neighbouring farms one evening as he sat outside and waited he began to philosophise over his experiences according to the author he couldn't understand that such an unbelievable luxury really existed and that the whites really lived the way they did after a long time and many such parties he began to realise that the whites existence was in a remarkable way unreal a sort of beautiful dream built on a lie which the whites told themselves that good can come of evil and that it is possible to lead a civilised existence while not acknowledging as human_beings those whose sweat and blood made their privileges possible kunta kinte was right negro slavery was incompatible with american civilisation in the same way as the apartheid_system is in reality incompatible with south_african there are few if any recorded examples in history of privileged groups who voluntarily relinquish privileges to the advantage of the repressed in all probability it won't happen in south_africa either the possibility of an unbloody resolution of the conflict is nevertheless still there it is such a solution that desmond_tutu fights for the presentation of the peace_prize to him is therefore not a judgement rather it is a challenge a hand stretched out in the same way as desmond tutu's hand is stretched out to conciliation and atonement if only the dominant minority would recognise this opportunity and take the chance before history's amnesty runs out it will be understood that to present desmond tutu's nobel peace_prize with a white man's hands is in some ways an oppressive experience on such an occasion it is impossible not to allow one's thoughts to consider what the white man has prepetrated against his coloured cousins it is depressing to think of the list of debts which is written with the african's suffering tears and blood think of the humiliation and exploitation which human_beings from this continent have had to endure from the first slave traffic through centuries of colonialism to today's discrimination on a day like this our memories are indeed painful not only on account of what the white man has done and still does but also on account of what he to this day has neglected to do thus as we now present the nobel peace_prize to the african desmond_tutu our immediate feeling is that our first word to the prize_laureate ought to be a word describing our sorrow over the wounds which injustice and racial hatred has inflicted on his people the dominating feeling is however one of thankfulness and respectful joy and this is because we feel ourselves united with him in the belief in the creative power of love with his warmhearted christian faith he is a representative of the best in us all additionally there is a factor which the nobel_committee has placed great emphasis on that in the liberation process which desmond_tutu leads black and white stand shoulder to shoulder in the common cause against injustice in this we see a moving confirmation of the words in alfred_nobel's testament on the brotherhood of mankind in the light of this we bring our homage to desmond_tutu because his struggle is and has to be our struggle we recognise him as a brother he receives today the peace_prize as a sign of the thankfulness of millions perhaps also as an omen of black and white africans final victory over the last remnants of opposition in the campaign for freedom and peace it is appropriate to remember the words of martin_luther king just before his martyrdom i have seen the promised land even_though the black south african's way forward to freedom's promised land can still be long and difficult it is a way of humanity which we shall traverse together in the sound knowledge that we shall overcome therefore our first word to the peace_prize laureate will be a word of hope and victory oh yes deep in my heart i do believe that we shall overcome some day your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen this_year's award of the nobel peace_prize gives us once_again an opportunity to reconsider a well_known detail in the wording of alfred_nobel's will the prize it is stated is to be awarded to the individual or group who has done the most or the best work for fraternity_between nations for the abolition_or reduction of standing_armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses what is especially important here is the way in which the question of disarmament is given a direct relationship to the attitudes of peoples and nations to one another brotherhood and disarmament are two aspects of the same issue work aimed_at giving international relationships a quality of unity rather_than conflict can therefore be seen as a step on the way to a bilateral and controlled disarmament through this_year's award of the peace_prize the norwegian_nobel committee_wishes to emphasize this aspect of the struggle for peace to direct attention to the way in which the problem of disarmament is a concern not only of politicians but also of the general public in all countries no one can avoid being aware of the anxious interest shown in this problem today not least among children and young people the reason for this is obvious with the development of atomic weapons the question of disarmament has been given a new dimension we could almost say an eternal dimension the prevention of an outbreak of war is increasingly regarded as a question of life or death for the human race it is in this connection that this_year's peace_prize laureate the international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war has in the opinion of the nobel_committee made a commendable contribution in accordance_with the ancient hippocratic oath which demands a dedication without compromise to the protection of life and health this organization has indicated using the evidence of medical science the dangers to life and health which atomic weapons represent these physicians have told us what will happen if these weapons were to be used we know now about the atomic winter with its destruction of the biosphere and of all conditions necessary for life the physicians have also shown the absence of any escape route and that there is no feasible protection available against such an atomic catastrophe home defence and medical services would inevitably collapse it would be impossible to help the injured and the dying and survivors would be subjected to the murderous long_term consequences another aspect of this matter is that the resources which are today used in the development of new weapons could have been used to help the millions of people who die of hunger and lack of adequate health care what can be more true to the spirit of the hippocratic oath than this campaign for new priorities in the use of the available resources from military ends to health and other development causes also in this area the international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war has presented an informative and convincing documentation the norwegian_nobel committee believes that the organization in this way has made an important contribution to activating the general opposition to nuclear armaments and contributes therefore to a mobilization of opinion which is now taking place all over the world it is also true that the question of bilateral and controlled reduction of nuclear arsenal has been offered a considerable amount of attention at innumerable disarmament conferences the results have not been particularly encouraging possibly the former laureate alva_myrdal was correct in believing that all we can hope for now is a stronger mobilization of public opposition and a corresponding strengthening of pressure on the political authorities however that may be a contribution to an increased public opposition to the continued atomic arms_race can only be seen as a contribution to the cause of peace the international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war has in the opinion of the nobel_committee made such a contribution it is obvious that if such a public opposition is to have real value as a peace inducing force it has to be built up independently of ideological systems political viewpoints or geographical divisions it has to be universal one has to begin with the simple fact that faced with the threat of a nuclear war the whole of the world's population is in the same boat or as nikita kruschev once expressed it after the first exchange of atomic bombs no one will be able to see the difference between capitalist and communist ashes face to face with the threat of nuclear war there is one common interest which will assert itself over all others the will to survive in other words there is a common human interest in preventing nuclear war the feeling for this common interest is now beginning to be so strong that a watchword seems to be evolving people of all lands who wish to survive unite it is precisely in the light of the fact that this public_opinion has to be universal that the norwegian_nobel committee regards as particularly important the fact that the international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war is the result of a common initiative from american and soviet doctors together they have created a forum for cooperation which transcends borders which are otherwise all too often sealed building on their realistic evaluation of the situation these physicians have chosen to stand shoulder to shoulder and to work together in a cooperation founded on trust and confidence the nobel_committee believes this was a good decision this opinion is obviously shared by many although the organization has only existed for five_years it now has active support from physicians in more_than forty countries all over the world and this support is growing one thousand delegates from fifty countries are expected to take part in next year's annual congress which is to be held in cologne west germany the organization has achieved widespread recognition for its work at the third annual congress in amsterdam declarations of support were received from among others the secretary_general of the united_nations and from pope john paul ii as well as from a number of heads of government in both east and west in 1984 the international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war was awarded unesco's peace education prize for its remarkable contribution to informing public_opinion and mobilizing the conscience of the human race in the cause of peace as the citation stated the international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war receives active support from the world health_organization which acts as distributor for the organization's reports on the medical consequences of nuclear explosions from march of this year the organization has been recognized as a so_called non governmental organization officially connected to the world health_organization in a statement from the who the point is made that the prevention of an atomic war is the most_important task in the field of health politics a task which all physicians should have a duty to contribute to the award of the nobel peace_prize to the international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war should be seen as yet another recognition of a transnational contribution to the cause of peace coming from physicians who see it as their duty to mobilize the strongest possible public opposition to atomic annihilation it is permissible to wonder whether we don't already know enough about the terrible consequences of a nuclear war the answer is of course that we know more_than enough while visiting the peace museum which the japanese have erected on the spot where the first atomic bomb fell forty_years ago however i came across the following epitaph we know 100 times more_than we need to know what we lack is the ability to experience and to be moved by what we know what we understand and what we see and believe one can see that this epitaph touches the heart of the matter a theoretic knowledge of the megaton bomb's explosive power is not enough it isn't enough to be frightened to sleeplessness by fiction films on the atomic ragnarock the question is what shall we do about it do we have the ability to begin to act is it possible to force a change of direction this is the question which has become our time's to be or not to be albert_einstein wrote in connection with the development of atomic weapons we shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive the international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war has in addition to its information work attempted to create such a new way of thinking here again it is apposite to recall the way in which nobel's will emphasizes the connection between the problem of disarmament and the peoples attitude to one another all the many bloody chapters in the history of mankind tell us of this connection it starts when groups of peoples and nations begin to regard each_other as enemies in time each side considers the oppositions to be evil incarnate the enemy has become a monster capable of unscrupulously attacking and destroying history especially european history has unfortunately far too many examples of this philosophy's self fertilizing effect what sort of results would this philosophy have today with the murderous potential the various groups now have control over we have to conclude that the need for a new direction is now categorical or as einstein said it is now a question of life or death for mankind alongside the atomic weapons a new reality has been created based_on the fact that an atomic war cannot be won it is no_longer possible to solve problems through a power political confrontation and if a war were to be begun the question of who was to blame would be totally uninteresting afterwards the world's conflicts would have found what hitler called the final solution is it possible to find a responsible politician who desires such a solution obviously not we have to believe all politicians who declare that this is precisely what we must avoid because it is the truth the riddle is of course to explain why the arms_race continues how is it possible in a world ravaged by famine poverty and sickness that anyone has the conscience to use more_than 800 million dollars a year on armaments the explanation is simple the reason is fear a fear created and kept alive by the well_known enemy philosophy which more or less consciously sets its mark on both ideas and attitudes nobody dares to take the risk of relying on the other side without this bilateral fear it would be difficult to find any rational argument for the build_up of armaments nobody with any knowledge of the information and propaganda which support our age's balance of terror can be in doubt the driving_force behind the arms_race is the two sides fear and lack of confidence in one another the extent to which this lack of confidence is promoted as a political doctrine is an indicator of the dangerous nature of today's world as a place in which to live one's life another aspect of the same picture is the fact that from time to time things are both said and done which can easily be interpreted as confirmation of the doubts the various parties have of one another as a general rule we have a tendency to believe the enemy when he says something which confirms our suspicions if he on the other_hand says something which indicates that he is interested in peace and friendship it is argued that we would be stupid to believe him as his intention is to give us a false sense of security in order to be able to destroy us all the more easily it is easy to see how such a mode of thinking creates problems for arms reduction negotiations the result is all too well_known for our own security's sake we have to have more weapons because we cannot trust the opposition and they have to have at least as many weapons because they cannot trust us and thereby the evil circle is made whole meanwhile fear and insecurity grow in all countries and resources which could have been used in the fight_against famine and sickness are used to further increase an arsenal which was more_than big enough before it was once fashionable to talk about the inevitable conflict it is universally accepted today that such an argumentation cannot be maintained the unavoidable truth is that our little planet could not survive an atomic war nobody today dares to think of an atomic confrontation as unavoidable this makes the question which is being raised in more and more countries even more urgent why do we develop more and more sophisticated atomic weapons when we know that each new development makes their use seem even more absurd there is of course no political or ideological objective which can justify the use of such weapons for who would be able to enjoy the fruits of our wonderful political or ideological systems if the price of their introduction is a common annihilation among all the complications which abound in our world there remains one simple fact we have the choice between living together or ceasing to live at all irrespective of what we call ourselves or to which political philosophy we subscribe it is this reality which has to be the starting_point for our thoughts and actions that is if we want to survive this is becoming increasingly more recognized we have to assume that the fear of atomic war and the will to prevent it is just as strong in all human_beings wherever in the world they live the absurdity of the atomic arms_race is ever more apparent and its necessity ever more doubtful it ought to be simple to argue that resources ought to be diverted to causes like health care or used for the benefit of those in need the creation of a new way of thinking and acting based_on this common opinion ought not to be too difficult it is regrettable that the world is divided in the way we know it is it is just as regrettable that atomic weapons were ever invented this is however the unfortunate reality with which we have to live the technological development or weapons cannot be reversed and it is even questionable that our divided world can be united through a power political confrontation it is in the light of this reality that we have to define our own involvement and it is this reality which now presents humankind with a decisive test nobody can opt out by resorting to the easy excuse that it is the other side which is responsible and that it is their philosophy and actions which make ours an unfortunate necessity the problem is that those on the other side reason in precisely the same way the fear which oppresses mankind today is the possibility that both_sides are right and that we can begin to build the future on the basis of a strategy which would be disastrous precisely at the moment it showed itself to be correct it is in the light of this reality that we have to regard the engagement in the cause of peace which has been shown by the international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war the norwegian_nobel committee does_not regard the evaluation of this organization's or any other's concrete proposals for disarmament to be part of its duties the committee is primarily interested in the way in which international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war has directed its efforts towards the brotherhood which is the key to the problem of disarmament a forum has been created where discussions and actions can be raised out of ideological blind alleys the organization has recognized the consequences of the fact that only by uniting in a common cause today is it possible to make even things that are impossible today possible tomorrow in the opinion of the nobel_committee the international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war has shown that this is a feasible course and it is our duty to believe that the cause of peace can only be promoted through common interests and brotherhood the nobel peace_prize has especially in later years often been awarded to campaigners for human_rights the committee has followed and still follows the fate of these prizewinners with interest but also in the hope that the concept of human value they represent will be successful and will be consummated in the universal recognition of the freedom which is every human being's birthright this_year's prize is more concerned with the problem of disarmament but is also at a deeper level concerned with human_rights perhaps even the most fundamental human right of them all the right to live the right to a life and a future for us all for our children and for our grandchildren yes it is concerned with the unborn generations right to inherit that earth which we today tend on their behalf it is in the light of this fundamental right of man that the organization international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war has chosen its course and as it now receives the peace_prize it is in recognition of a constructive work in the cause of peace but the prize also expresses a hope a hope for the steady advance of a new way of thinking so that bridges can be built over the chasms that represent our fear of the future mankind in all countries is united in that hope your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen it is today exactly 50 years since the nobel peace_prize was awarded to the german public figure and pacifist carl_von ossietzky 1 that particular award was one of the most controversial ever made the newly established nazi regime in germany was violently critical of the norwegian_nobel committee and german citizens were forbidden to accept nobel prizes in the future this type of reaction was in a way so predictable that it can be ignored what we ought to be more interested in on the other_hand is the type of reaction which came from countries other than germany many were of course delighted but there were also many commentators who were sceptical leading figures in politics and the press expressed the opinion that ossietzky was too extreme in his warnings and revelations some believed him to be a communist in any case it was argued the cause of peace was poorly served by a peace_prize which seemed to be a direct provocation of the german government the existence of such reactions was obviously partly a result of judging the hitler regime by current political and moral criteria most people were in contrast to ossietzky unable to recognise the deadly threat to democracy which was developing when the threat was at last recognised people were more or less paralysed by the hitler roar and had few resources to fight it with other than the almost desperate appeasement politics represented by chamberlain during nazism's formative years the general attitude was one of unsuspicious ambivalence of course one disagreed with hitler but when is one not in disagreement with politicians and of course one was aware of the terrible rumours about the brownshirts atrocities but wasn't it necessary to evaluate this against the background of the extraordinary situation in the country at least there was now a strong and active government and hitler was of course a democratically elected leader most people feared some sort of unavoidable catastrophe but only a few suspected the extent of what was happening and it is precisely because of this blindness that the catastrophe was allowed to happen ibsen's buttonmaker was proved right once_again it's when insight is lacking that the fellow with the hoof takes his best prey carl_von ossietzky had insight he has the courage and ability to tell of what he saw and therefore acted as an unafraid witness for truth and justice all honour to the then nobel_committee for awarding him the nobel peace_prize his testimony was however also his doom ossietzky did not survive his meeting with the terrible regime which had established itself in the heart of europe today fifty_years later the peace_prize is to be presented to one who survived in 1945 on the ashes left behind after the sacrificial flames which annihilated six_million jews sat the seventeen year old elie_wiesel an only son of abraham an isaac who once_again had escaped a sacrificial death on mount moriah at the last moment he will receive the nobel peace_prize today because he too has become a witness for truth and justice from the abyss of the death camps he has come as a messenger to mankind not with a message of hate and revenge but with one of brotherhood and atonement he has become a powerful spokesman for the view of mankind and the unlimited humanity which is at all times the basis of a lasting peace elie_wiesel is not only the man who survived he is also the spirit which has conquered in him we see a man who has climbed from utter humiliation to become one of our most_important spiritual leaders and guides the nobel_committee believes it is vital that we have such guides in an age when terror repression and racial_discrimination still exist in the world with today's presentation of the peace_prize a bridge is built between the german who gave his life in the fight_against what he saw was going to happen and the jew who has dedicated his life to fighting anything that could lead to a recurrence of that same tragedy it is appropriate that there is a nobel peace_prize at both ends of that bridge elie_wiesel was born on the 30th of september 1928 in the romanian town of sighet in the carpathians he and his three sisters grew_up in a peaceful family which was strongly bound by jewish traditions and the jewish religion elie was fourteen years old when the deportation of hungarian jews began sighet was now occupied by hungary and the town's jewish population was packed in the usual humiliating way into goods wagons and transported to auschwitz there he saw his mother and youngest sister sent to the gas chambers later his father died while being transported to buchenwald through his books elie_wiesel has given us not only an eyewitness account of what happened but also an analysis of the evil powers which lay behind the events his main concern is the question of what measures we can take to prevent a recurrence of these events the terrors he encountered in the death camps which were slowly revealed to the rest of the world were something which was qualitatively new in the history of mankind the holocaust was a war within a war a world in itself a kingdom of darkness where there existed an evil so monstrous that it shattered all political and moral codes it represented a new dimension according to its theoretical basis which could only have been the product of sick minds it was a capital offence to belong to a certain race this was previously unimaginable but now the unimaginable was happening it is true that previous regimes had used brutal punishment against real or imagined opponents but behind such measures there was always an element of logical though perverted reasoning the punishment was the result of some injury or offence either actual or potential but for the jews and to a certain extent the romanies the situation was different among the relics of the nazi regime have been found registration forms used when arresting jews the usual details were noted down name age sex religion address and of course reason for arrest in the last case only one word was entered the word jew the enormity of what happened is thus not only the sheer number of the victims it is not only the existence of factory like slaughter houses no the enormity lies in the philosophy which made this industry possible it is this that elie_wiesel wants us to understand his mission is not to gain the world's sympathy for the victims or the survivors his aim is to awaken our conscience our indifference to evil makes us partners in the crime that is the reason for his attack on indifference and his insistence on measures aimed_at preventing a new holocaust we know that the unimaginable has happened what are we doing now to prevent it happening again do not forget do not sink into a new blind indifference but involve yourselves in truth and justice in human_dignity freedom and atonement that is this peace_prize laureate's message to us elie wiesel's sojourn in the death camps ended in buchenwald in the spring of 1945 when the prisoners were liberated by american troops together with a group of other jewish children he was sent to france his stay in france was part convalescence part study he learnt french and studied at the sorbonne before becoming a correspondent with a tel aviv newspaper he travelled to the usa as a journalist became a correspondent with a new_york jewish paper and took american citizenship in 1963 in the meantime he had published a number of books of which night 1956 was the first his writings which have been translated_into many languages now include twenty six full length books together with a large number of articles essays and lectures he has been awarded a number of honours and prizes elie_wiesel is an honorary professor at city college in new_york and has in addition a professorship in humanities at boston university he is the leader of the american holocaust commission instigated by the president of the usa biographical details are perhaps unnecessary in elie wiesel's case he is best presented through his own writings and through his actions in pursuit of his call naturally enough it was his own people's fate which formed the starting_point for his involvement during the years however his message has attained a universal character presented as it is in different variations and in different contexts it stands now as communication from one human being to humankind its involvement is limitless and encompasses all who suffer wherever they might be the fight for freedom and human_dignity whether in latin_america asia europe or south_africa has become his life's purpose this involvement is based_on a strong feeling of duty to the lessons which history teaches us it has been said that peoples or cultures who forget their history are doomed to repeat it and it is against the background of his own experiences that elie_wiesel now warns us of this we cannot allow ourselves to forget the fate of those_who died if we do forget we commit them to death once_again and become responsible ourselves for making their lives and their deaths meaningless this warning has also a future perspective we must not allow the unsuspicious ambivalence to return and open the way for an atomic holocaust we cannot allow ourselves to be deluded into believing that the unthinkable will not happen for it has happened once before history has warned us the duty and responsibility which elie_wiesel preaches are not primarily concerned with the fear of the terrors of the past repeating themselves it is much more an engagement directed at preventing the possible victory of evil forces in the future the creative force in this process is not hate and revenge but rather a longing for freedom a love of life and a respect for human_dignity or as elie_wiesel has said himself i will conquer our murderers by attempting to reconstruct what they destroyed no elie wiesel's standpoint is not characterised by a passive obsession with a tragic history rather it is a reconstructed belief in god humanity and the future and it is truly a belief which is both hard won and tested elie_wiesel sat thus in the ashes after auschwitz the storm and fire had terrorised his life everything was in ruins his family was annihilated two of his sisters were alive though he was not aware of this at the time he was homeless and without a fatherland even his identity as a human being was undermined he was now prisoner number a 7713 a sort of shipwrecked sailor on a burnt coast without hope without a future only the naked memories remained and like job in the ashes he sat there and questioned his god cast his agonised why towards heaven why did this have to happen and why should i have survived dear god why were six_million of your own chosen people sent to their deaths where were you when they hanged twelve year olds in auschwitz or burned small children alive in birkenau he was seventeen years old and how could a life be lived after what had happened the sorrow was so great and the experience of life so bitter indeed he was only seventeen but was already the lonely prophet of the lamentations is it nothing to you all ye that pass by behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow but he was alive and in time it occurred to him that there could be a purpose behind it that he was to be a witness the one who would pass on the account of what had happened so that the dead would not have died in vain and so that the living could learn the problem was that the story was impossible to tell no human being could accurately describe the terror which existed in the death camps to tell could thus easily become a betrayal of the dead but to remain silent would be an even greater betrayal he remained silent for ten_years then his profession as a journalist brought him into contact_with the french poet and nobel prizewinner francois mauriac this meeting led him to break his silence at first with night and then in the course of very short time with dawn the accident the town beyond the wall the gates of the forest the play zalmen a beggar in jerusalem and his credo ani maamin i believe all elie wiesel's books and publications are concerned with the same theme the holocaust is present in them all as he himself says you can get out of auschwitz but auschwitz can never get out of you but even_though the theme is always the same and even_though the same story is repeated time after time there is always a new approach which opens up new perspectives there is a remarkable development in wiesel's authorship we see a forward looking development in a human being who regains his upright position and his individual identity in the beginning everything is night and dark on the last page of night he stands in front of the mirror and sees a face which is like a bleached skull even in dawn the day doesn't dawn the whole book is a fight with the darkness of night the problem is constantly the same painful question how can one live a meaningful life under the weight of such agonising memories is the german philosopher correct in stating that memory is in the service of everlasting agony was there no way forward to day and to light the answer comes slowly we meet the first intimation of dawn in the town beyond the wall where two prisoners one of whom is mad and the other dumb manage to find a means by which they can communicate with one another the dumb prisoner breaks his silence and the lunatic shows that he perhaps isn't so insane after all they build a relationship which is a salvation for both of them the same thought is developed in the gate of the forest and a beggar in jerusalem and as the books progress the light becomes brighter the man raises himself up the spirit conquers the answer to the riddle of the night is not hate based_on what has happened but a believing and hopeful rebirth into future events this is what he calls the refound song which appears in his credo his ani maamin i believe in god in spite of god i believe in mankind in spite of mankind i believe in the future in spite of the past and with this hard won belief he stands forward today with his message to all people on this earth this is a message which not only awakens our conscience but also inspires a limitless solidarity where individuals find one another in the labor of building a town beyond the wall for the future beyond the wall of evil and dark memories it is on account of this inspiration that elie_wiesel has so successfully reached out with his message i doubt whether any other individual through the use of such quiet speech has achieved more or been more widely heard the words are not big and the voice which speaks them is low it is a voice of peace we hear but the power is intense truly the little spark will not be put out but will become a burning torch for our common belief in the future truly prisoner number a 7713 has become a human being once_again a human being dedicated to humanity and once_again we have met the young jew at the ford jabbok in the book of genesis he who in the darkness of night wrestled with god he who refused to release his opponent before his opponent blessed him and who left that place at dawn marked for life on his hip it was to this man that the promise of the future was made from on high thy name shall be called israel for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed it is in recognition of this particular human spirit's victory over the powers of death and degradation and as a support to the rebellion of good against the evil in the world that the norwegian_nobel committee today presents the nobel peace_prize to elie_wiesel we do this on_behalf of millions from all peoples and races we do it in deep reverence for the memory of the dead but also with the deep felt hope that the prize will be a small contribution which will forward the cause which is the greatest of all humanity's concerns the cause of peace your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen this_year's peace_prize one of the six nobel prizes which are to be presented today is primarily a homage and an expression of thanks to oscar_arias sánchez for the praiseworthy work he has done in the cause of attaining a lasting peace in central_america few regions of the world have had worse experiences of civil war and conflict during recent_years insecurity repression lack of freedom and poverty have long been a part of everyday life for the majority of the 25 million people who live in the area for these people there is now a hope on the 7th of august this year the presidents of nicaragua el salvador guatemala honduras and costa_rica signed a peace plan for central_america the norwegian_nobel committee believes that this plan opens the way for a development which can replace bloody conflict with an open trusting society the main architect behind this plan is this_year's prizewinner the president of costa_rica oscar_arias he stands today as the strongest exponent of the longing for peace among the peoples of central_america he is also an exponent of the democratic ideals which if they can be realised are a decisive precondition for a long lasting peace this is the reason that the plan is a signpost in the work for peace the whole world over victor hugo said that nothing is stronger than an idea when the time is ripe we must believe that the time is now ripe for precisely the idea which has manifested itself in the central american peace plan oscar_arias is one of those_who had the vision to recognise this the fact that the plan is the result of a cooperation between the five signatory states indicates that there is in fact a general recognition that the time is ripe the peace_prize to oscar_arias is therefore to be interpreted as a recognition also of the work of the other heads of state and their work with the plan oscar_arias is at the age of 46 a relatively young peace_prize laureate it is probable that the bulk of his life's work is still to be done but what he has already achieved indicates that he is one of the most_important leaders in latin_america he has the personal and theoretical background as well as the necessary experience to continue the work for peace which has been started in the area he began his political career seriously in 1970 at the age of 29 when he became an assistant to former president josé figueres who was seeking re election the election campaign was successful figueres won the election in 1970 and oscar_arias became a member of the government as minister for national planning and political economy in 1978 arias was elected to the national assembly as a representative for the national liberty party at that time he was the party's international secretary and from 1979 he was also its general secretary in 1985 he was nominated as his party's candidate for the presidency and at the election the year after he became president it is probably not a coincidence that it is the president of costa_rica who has become the principal force behind the work for peace in central_america the country is in many ways a haven of peace in an area which unfortunately has been anything but peaceful even during the period of spanish colonialism there was something special about costa_rica the country was not as the name would suggest a rich country there was nothing there which could make the place interesting for gold prospectors or other fortune seekers the country was too small for the establishment of large profitable land holdings the settlers in the first colony took enough land to secure their daily bread and they worked themselves on the land slavery was neither necessary nor affordable even the founder of the colony was an ordinary hardworking farmer in this way costa_rica avoided the formation of a rich upper class of landowners with power over a landless and poverty stricken majority a pattern which is often found in the third world the small population in 1821 there were only 65,000 was thus mainly composed of land owning small farmers the population was also homogeneous both culturally and economically and since the country was also relatively isolated from the bureaucratic centralized spanish administration it developed a strong and resilient attitude towards freedom and independence in other words the country was an ideal centre for democratic traditions when costa_rica became an independent republic at the beginning of the 1830s the transition was made without the use of weapons or the shedding of blood throughout its whole history the use of military power has been unnecessary and the country can be proud of having had a stable democratic system which has lasted since the 1890s this has set its mark on the country until the present time after a short armed uprising in 1948 a new constitution was decreed it declared that costa_rica would be a country without a military force whatever one might think of such a body one has to accept that the willingness to abolish it shows an interest in peace which is relatively unusual in this world even_though the country has armed guards at its borders it is still without military forces in the usual sense of the word it has been said that costa_rica has more school teachers than soldiers some have even claimed that the country's artillery wouldn't even be able to fire a twenty one gun salute in the event of a state visit though this particular detail might now have been corrected it has also been said that the country's two main products are good coffee and good and upright people in truth a praiseworthy form of production the civil authorities in costa_rica have traditionally given priority to investment in the education system health and economic development the result is that costa_rica is exceptional in the area also with regard to economic_growth and social equality this is true even_though costa_rica has considerable economic problems as a result of the lower price of coffee and the rising price of oil in the decade from the mid 1970s costa rica's central role in the peace process in central_america has its background in the country's democratic traditions a positive turn in this work occurred in 1983 when the so_called contadora group presented its 21 point preliminary agenda for a peace plan the group was composed of mexico venezuela colombia and panama and the plan included nicaragua el salvador guatemala honduras and costa_rica it had also been approved by the leaders of these five countries before it was made public for reasons too complicated to present here the contadora plan did not result in the planned peace treaty but it did awaken interest and did receive support especially from western europe and canada the reagan administration announced that the plan was the best foundation for a lasting solution of the problems in the area but the contadora plan became a political backwater while the military activity in the area grew when oscar_arias became president of costa_rica he immediately began working on the completion of the contadora group's intentions together with the presidents of nicaragua guatemala el salvador and honduras he worked on a new peace plan which was finally signed in august this year in principle this plan is based_on the same ideas as the contadora plan but the proposals are more definite they are based_on among other_things a concurrent ceasefire in the civil wars of nicaragua el salvador and guatemala an amnesty for all guerilla soldiers the abolition of the state of emergency the release of political prisoners and the establishment of freedom of the press and a democratic form of government there are two things about this plan which are particularlyworth commenting on the first is that the plan is the five signatory states own plan conceived and signed without involvement or pressure from outside this is important not least because it expresses a particular view of the situation in central_america the view that the conflicts are an internal problem for the region and that they are a result of the existing social and economic injustices as so often in the third world it is a question of injustice in the relationship_between the big landowners and the poor landless in addition it is a question of a brutal use of power against any form of opposition and of a minority government which discriminates without mercy this is once_again the sad story of the privileged minorities who resist the demands of the poor for justice with armed resistance and as always this results in the release of revolutionary forces when the authorities then react with repeated repression instead of political and social reforms the result can never be anything other than conflict perhaps it ought never to be anything else the central american peace plan addresses itself to a different sort of problem the intention is clear since the conflict is the result of problems within the five states it is the five states themselves who have to solve the problems it is in accordance_with this principle that the plan suggests that all outside help to the opposition forces has to cease the peace plan's message in this connection can only be interpreted in one way outside powers must if they will serve the cause of peace in the area stop any actions which can contribute to keeping the never ending civil war alive the combatting groups need help help to change the underlying circumstances which are the root cause of the conflict it has been suggested that peace and stability have to be established before any reforms can be made the weakness of this argument even if it can be regarded as correct is that efforts to create stability can be a support for the power groups who oppose reform the process would therefore strengthen the revolutionary situation the solution is obviously to be found in the doctrine that the imbalances which are at the root of the conflict have to be changed if that is successful it will be possible to establish peace and stability based_on a foundation acceptable to the people themselves this is the reality all outside parties have to accept this leads us to the other remarkable aspect of the peace plan the principle of the intimate relationship_between peace and democracy already in the speech he held at his inauguration as costa rica's president oscar_arias made this principle a major point our experience he said has taught_us that democracy is the form of government which gives the greatest possibilities for a future anchored on justice government through the decisions of correctly elected organs is the only way to a liberation from poverty and dependence what oscar_arias is saying is that democracy is something more_than a form of government it is in reality an important tool in the work for peace we have to accept however unwillingly and independently of how old our own democratic traditions are that the principle of majority rule is not perfect in a number of areas we are only on the way towards the goals we have set ourselves but democracy has the obvious advantage that it makes possible the further development of democracy and because this is the case we have also achieved goals which newly established democracies around the world can only dream of it is important to have this historical perspective before us when we evaluate the quality of the young democracies they have their difficult path to tread just as we had the present situation in central_america gives us hope because democracy has been given a chance democracy is in contrast to totalitarian regimes dependent on support from the people this support is in its turn dependent on the experiences of the people as long as democracy can be identified with free elections freedom of expression with honest measures for social_justice and with a moderate improvement in economic status the positive development can continue with the people's support the future of democracy will be dependent on the realisation of a minimum of the people's expectations it can be difficult to accept the overturning of a dictatorship if the system which replaces it brings with it lack of freedom corruption and injustice government by the people makes demands both on the individuals who govern and on the people who elect their leaders there are demands for moral qualities and there have to be ideals which nobody can reasonably deny with this as a background it is easy to see why the central american peace plan is so strongly rooted in the connection between peace and democracy peace will be realised if democracy is realised in this way the peace plan is something more_than a dream and a hope it is a powerful challenge not only to the leaders of the five countries but also to all of us if we have anything to contribute which can affect the development of this area let it be a contribution to social and economic liberation and to the growth of a government by the people which is in central_america as elsewhere one of the keys to peace the award of the peace_prize usually has two goals this is particularly true this year the prize to oscar_arias is a recognition of an achieved result the peace plan it sets its sights also on the future and is a moral support in the work for peace which is based_on that plan the norwegian_nobel committee_wishes after much thought to place the prestige of the nobel peace_prize in the scale to the advantage of those_who struggle for democracy for justice for development and for the natural rights of the peoples in their countries oscar_arias is one of the foremost of those_who strive to achieve those goals his name is today a focal point in the work for peace which is anchored in the will of the people and in respect for human_rights it is the nobel_committee's hope that the peace_prize will contribute to his success in the symbolic building dedicated to peace which is now being raised for the war weary people of central_america your_majesty your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the award of the nobel peace_prize to the united_nations peacekeeping_forces is unfortunately a reminder to us that peace is not a matter of course here in our world peace has to be actively protected and this protection has its price 733 young people have sacrificed their lives in the service of the particular form of peacekeeping which is under consideration here the norwegian_nobel committee asks those gathered together here_today to join them in honouring the memory of those young people they came from different countries and had widely different backgrounds but they were united in one thing they were willing to devote their youth and their energy to the service of peace they volunteered to the service knowing that it could involve risk it became their lot to pay the highest price a human being can pay we honour them for their unselfish contribution and we join their relatives in their sorrow over their loved ones early departure let_us show this through a moment's silence we invoke peace on the memory of these young people in a spirit of thankfulness and deep respect for the first time in its history the peace_prize is to be awarded today to an organisation which at least in part consists of military forces it might be reasonable to ask whether this is in fact in direct contradiction to the whole idea of the peace_prize the fact that this question has not been raised is an indication that it is universally accepted that the united_nations peacekeeping_forces are in the spirit of the peace_prize the description forces is in itself inadequate since it conjures up the idea of a military operation in the traditional sense while the reality is in many ways the diametric opposite a more correct description would be the united_nations peacekeeping operation consisting of both contingents of troops and unarmed observation corps these peacekeeping_operations were commenced in 1956 when the unef united_nations emergency force was established in connection with the suez crisis the security_council was unable to act because of a veto from two of the member states instead use was made of the so_called uniting for peace resolution which gives the general_assembly of the united_nations the power to intervene in the event of the security_council being unable to act in the face of a threat to world peace the general_assembly was summoned to a special_session in the following events important roles were played by two prominent individuals the former foreign_minister of canada lester_pearson and the then secretary_general of the united_nations dag_hammarskjöld both of these men were later awarded the nobel peace_prize through the influence of these two plans were made and a resolution passed for a peacekeeping force which was to supervise the retreat of foreign troops from the canal zone the principles which were defined for this peace operation were written in the main by dag_hammarskjöld it is an honour to his memory that the same guidelines are generally speaking in use today the most_important points in these guidelines are 1 the involved parties must give their support and cooperation to the united_nations forces 2 the primary aim is to prevent new hostilities and provide a background against which it is possible to work for a peaceful_solution of the conflict 3 the force is to make use of negotiation and persuasion instead of violence 4 the force is under the command of the leadership of the united_nations and is not allowed to accept orders from other parts not even the states who have made the troops available 5 all member nations should contribute to the financing of the forces the peacekeeping_forces have on the basis of the resolution of 1956 and the guidelines drawn_up by dag_hammarskjöld developed into what present secretary_general perez de cuéllar calls the united_nations most successful renewal strangely enough the peacekeeping_forces as such were a new creation they are not named or even envisaged in the original united_nations treaty the treaty does mention the possibility of military involvement on the part of the united_nations in the event of hostilities but because of the relationship_between the great_powers it has never been possible to make use of this part of the treaty the possible exception being the action in korea in 1950 today's peacekeeping_operations are something quite different the troops are made available on a voluntary basis and are approved by the security_council they are stationed in areas where a ceasefire has already been established but where no formal peace treaty has been concluded and they are stationed in such a way that the conflicting parties in the event of a resumption of hostilities would meet the united_nations troops first actual fighting can thus be avoided peace and quiet maintained and it is possible to develop an atmosphere which makes active peace work possible the very presence of the united_nations troops can have a positive effect the soldiers very often make friends among the local population they can offer help and aid in many ways and are a conciliating element in otherwise explosive situations in this connection it is interesting to note a parallel with one of the ideas alfred_nobel worked on following a model from the french duelling etiquette the seconds in such a conflict could intervene between the combatants with the aim of achieving a delay in the duel so that tempers could be cooled and the whole business possibly solved by other means it is perhaps reasonable that there were powerful political objections to this model but the point remains the united_nations peacekeeping_forces today have just such an interventionist role because the united_nations is in this way on speaking terms with both parts negotiations which are at a standstill can perhaps be reopened and in many situations it is possible that armed fighting can be avoided the english brigadier michael harbottle who took_part in the united_nations peacekeeping_forces in cyprus at the end of the 1960 s has written a book on his experiences there the book is called the impartial soldier and in it he relates an episode which illustrates what the united_nations peacekeeping_operations mean better than any official report the finnish contingent under the command of colonel uolevi koskenpalo was involved in the episode a message was received to the effect that the turks had begun to dig trenches in a suspicious manner the greeks had observed this under the leadership of a general they had decided to take the affair into their own hands colonel koskenpalo had however placed his three platoons in precisely the right strategic position so that the greeks met the finnish united_nations troops first as intended the greek general disliked being hindered in this way and began to protest loudly in fact he screamed at the finn an obvious mistake in contrast to the greek colonel koskenpalo was a well built man with a chest and shoulders of nordic dimensions he advanced slowly and from a height of well over six feet looked down at the greek and said in a moderately loud voice don't shout general i_am a colonel in the finnish army and don't like being shouted at the reaction was surprising the general naturally didn't believe his ears but the shouting stopped immediately and in a little while he retreated together with his forces this gave the finn the opportunity to both inform and placate the greek high command and to persuade the turks to stop the provocative trench digging in this way a violent episode was avoided there have been many similar episodes where the united_nations peacekeeping_forces have intervened it is a question of a strictly peaceful behaviour combined with authority the finnish colonel was able to act as an efficient peace medium because he had the authority of the united_nations and the force of his well trained finnish united_nations soldiers behind him what has been said about the united_nations peacekeeping_forces is equally true of the united_nations observers their duties are to ensure that the security council's ceasefire demands are kept they mark the ceasefire line establish observation posts and report to the secretary_general if there are violations of the ceasefire this is an important role in critical situations reports from the observation corps will be non partisan and accurate in contrast to reports from the involved parties themselves this gives them an obvious value both to the involved parties and to the outside world generally it is often emphasised that the united_nations peacekeeping_operations are only carried_out at the invitation of the countries involved the troops and observation corps are guests in the area and they have a special responsibility to behave in a way which is in agreement with international_law and ordinary politeness experience to now indicates that the peacekeeping_forces have been a correct solution to the problem to the present there have been or are 13 peacekeeping_operations fifty three countries have contributed with personnel and the maximum force has been a total of 50,000 men if one counts all the soldiers who have been involved in these operations the total is something like 500,000 men the norwegian_nobel committee sees this mobilisation of troops from countries all over the world as a tangible expression of the world community's will to solve conflicts by peaceful_means the technological development of weapons systems has resulted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts becoming the only realistic possibility nuclear_weapons have made the concept of wielding total power an absurdity in conflict situations it is therefore vitally necessary that there are openings where real negotiations can be initiated in the opinion of the nobel_committee the united_nations peacekeeping_operations contribute precisely to this the committee believes also that the peacekeeping_operations and the way they are carried_out contribute to making the ideas which were the very reason for the establishment of the united_nations a reality this_year's peace_prize should therefore also be regarded as a recognition of the whole organisation the united_nations the prize gives expression to the hope we all place in the united_nations secretary_general pérez de cuéllar who is directly responsible for the peacekeeping_operations and who is therefore present today to receive the prize is here not only as the formal recipient receiving the prize on_behalf of others he is himself one of the prizewinners today with his never tiring work and the results he has achieved as an active mediator he should be accorded his part of the honour for the growing confidence which is shown in the united_nations confidence in the united_nations has otherwise been a variable factor the united_nations has for many been seen as a body without power or effectiveness a forum for bilateral insults a theatre stage at the side of the reality of world politics one has been able to have negative opinions of the united_nations without thereby colliding with the accepted state of affairs but there is one overpowering argument in favour of the united_nations the organisation has survived and now defends more and more both its right to exist and its capacity to survive it has been pointed_out quite correctly that the united_nations can only be what the member states make it they can paralyse the united_nations by ignoring its resolutions by vetoing by sabotaging its economy but they can also make the united_nations an active instrument in the fight for peace a focus for international_law and human_rights and a forum for the development of inter racial understanding the signs today indicate that it is the latter alternative which is in the course of realising itself perhaps the very idea of the united_nations is now coming into its own after what we have been through cold_war unsuccessful negotiations growing fear of a universal atomic death it is perhaps not so surprising that one again looks to the decisions that were made when the united_nations treaty was signed on the ruins of the second_world war the survivors decided that conflicts should thereafter be solved by peaceful_means barbarism should be replaced by friendly relations_between nations freedom and human_rights should be respected without reference to race sex language or religion and the united_nations were to be the means by which the aims of the united_nations treaty were to be realised this_year's peace_prize is a recognition of and homage to one organ of the united_nations but it ought to be understood as a serious comment on the fact that we must united and with our whole hearts invest in the united_nations it becomes clearer and clearer that what has to be done to secure the future for new generations has to be done together our determination has to be channelled into the united_nations this is the best hope for the future of the world indeed its only hope the belief and the hope which are placed in the united_nations have to be the hope and belief of the younger generations in the ideals of the united_nations they can search for their own ideals and it is they who are to form the world of the future in the selection of this_year's peace_prize laureate the nobel_committee attached therefore great importance to the role of young people in the united_nations peacekeeping_forces it is precisely the contribution of the young which makes the realisation of the united_nations aims possible in a positive way for obvious reasons it is precisely the young who today feel the crippling powerlessness in their meeting with the powers who steer the development of our world it is easy to lose one's foothold it is difficult to retain one's optimism at times it is unclear whether there is any point in attempting to do anything at all to all the young people who feel their situation in this way i would direct a question the question which the young norwegian_poet nordahl grieg took up in his poem to youth well may you ask in despondent alarm what is my weapon what is my arm and thus it is that the young prizewinners can today raise their united_nations flag and answer with the words of this poem by one of our own young fallen this is the sword you must bear in your fight faith in this life and man's god given right for the future of all seek it and choose it die if you must gird it on and use it silent the path of the arrow by night halt with the spirit its death dealing flight then only then will all warfare cease man's dignity only can give us true peace the nobel peace_prize is one of six awards bearing the name alfred_nobel that are presented today five of these awards are made in stockholm and the norwegian_nobel committee would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the laureates who will be honoured in the swedish capital today this_year's ceremony is an occasion of special gratification to us norwegians as one of the recipients is a norwegian professor trygve haavelmo the winner of this_year's nobel prize for economics we would like to congratulate him on this honour this_year's nobel peace_prize has been awarded to h.h the dalai_lama first and foremost for his consistent resistance to the use of violence in his people's struggle to regain their liberty ever_since 1959 the dalai_lama together with some one hundred_thousand of his countrymen has lived in an organised community in exile in india this is by no means the first community of exiles in the world but it is assuredly the first and only one that has not set_up any militant liberation movement this policy of nonviolence is all the more remarkable when it is considered in relation to the sufferings inflicted on the tibetan people during the occupation of their country the dalai lama's response has been to propose a peaceful_solution which would go a long way to satisfying chinese interests it would be difficult to cite any historical example of a minority's struggle to secure its rights in which a more conciliatory attitude to the adversary has been adopted than in the case of the dalai_lama it would be natural to compare him with mahatma_gandhi one of this century's greatest protagonists of peace and the dalai_lama likes to consider himself one of gandhi's successors people have occasionally wondered why gandhi himself was never awarded the nobel peace_prize and the present nobel_committee can with impunity share this surprise while regarding this_year's award of the prize as in part a tribute to the memory of mahatma_gandhi this_year's laureate will also be able to celebrate a significant jubilee as it is now fifty_years since he was solemnly installed as h.h the fourteenth dalai_lama of the tibetan people when he was four years old pursuing the process of selection that resulted in the choice of him in particular would involve trespassing what to a westerner is terra incognita where belief thought and action exist in a dimension of existence of which we are ignorant or maybe have merely forgotten according to buddhist tradition every new dalai_lama is a reincarnation of his predecessor and when the thirteenth died in 1933 a search was immediately instigated to find his reincarnation oracles and learned lamas were consulted and certain signs observed strange cloud formations drifted across the heavens the deceased placed in the so_called buddha position facing south was found two days later facing east this indicated that a search should be carried_out to the east and a delegation accordingly set_forth first to one of tibet's sacred lakes where the future could be revealed in the surface of the water in this case a monastery was indicated as well as a house with turquoise coloured tiles the delegation continued on its way and found first the monastery and then the house in the village of takster in eastern tibet it was the home of a crofter and his family and they were asked if they had any children they had a two year old son called tenzin gyatso a number of inexplicable acts carried_out by this boy convinced the delegation that they were at their journey's end and that the fourteenth dalai_lama had been found like so much else in the realm of religion this is not something we are asked to comprehend without reason we encounter phenomena that belong to a reality different from our own and to which we should respond not with an attempt at rational explanation but with reverent wonder throughout its history tibet has been a closed country with little contact_with the outside world this is also true of modern times and maybe explains why its leaders failed to attach due importance to formal de jure recognition of their country as an autonomous state this too may be one of the reasons why the outside world did not feel any obligation to support tibet when the country in 1950 and the years that followed was gradually occupied by the chinese who in direct opposition to the tibetans own interpretation claimed that tibet has always been a part of china in occupying the country the chinese have according to the conclusion reached by the international commission of jurists been guilty of the most pernicious crime that any individual or nation can be accused of viz a wilful attempt to annihilate an entire people meanwhile tenzin gyatso had by now reached the age of sixteen and in the critical situation that now arose he was charged with the task of playing the role of political leader to his people up till then the country had been ruled on his behalf by regents he would have to assume the authority that the title of dalai_lama involved a boy of sixteen without political experience and with no education beyond his study of buddhist lore which he had absorbed throughout his upbringing in his autobiography my life and my people he has given us a vivid account of his rigorous apprenticeship at the hands of tibetan lamas and he declares that what he learnt was to prove no mean preparation for his allotted career not least the political part of his work it was on this basis he now developed the policy of nonviolence with which he decided to confront the chinese invaders as a buddhist monk it was his duty never to harm any living creature but instead to show compassion to all life it is maybe not to be wondered at that people so closely involved in what they call the world of reality should consider his philosophy somewhat remote from ordinary considerations of military strategy the policy of nonviolence was also of course based_on pragmatic considerations a small nation of some six_million souls with no armed_forces to speak of faced one of the world's military superpowers in a situation of this kind the nonviolence approach was in the opinion of the dalai_lama the only practical one in accordance_with this he made several attempts during the 1950s to negotiate with the chinese his aim was to arrive_at a solution of the conflict that would be acceptable to both parties to the dispute based_on mutual respect and tolerance to achieve this he staked all his authority as dalai_lama to prevent any use of violence on the part of the tibetans and his authority proved decisive for as the dalai_lama he is according to the buddhist faith more_than a leader in the traditional sense he symbolises the whole nation his very person is imbued with some of the attributes of a deity which doubtless explains why his people despite gross indignities and acute provocation have to such a marked degree obeyed his wishes and abstained from the use of violence from his exile in india he now waged his unarmed struggle for his people with untiring patience he has every justification for calling his autobiography my life and my people because the life of the tibetans is in truth his life but political support from the outside world remained conspicuous by its absence apart from a few rather toothless un resolutions that were adopted in 1961 and 1965 throughout the 60s and 70s the dalai_lama was regarded as a pathetic figure from a distant past his beautiful and well meaning philosophy of peace was unfortunately out of place in this world but in the course of the 1980s things have taken a dramatic turn there are several reasons for this what has happened and is still happening in tibet has become more generally known and the community of nations has started to feel a sense of joint responsibility for the future of the tibetan people that their trials and tribulations have failed to break the spirit of the tibetans is another reason on the contrary their feeling of national pride and identity and their determination to survive have been enhanced and these are expressed in massive demonstrations here as in other parts of the world it is becoming increasingly obvious that problems cannot be solved by the use of brutal military power to crush peaceful demonstrations in tibet as elsewhere conflicts must be resolved politically through the medium of genuine negotiation the dalai lama's negotiating policy has received the support of a number of national assemblies and international bodies such as the united_states senate the west german bundestag the parliament of europe the united_states congress eighty six members of the australian parliament and the swiss national assembly nor should we forget that the dalai_lama has been the recipient of a number of international awards and honours in recognition of his work and in support of his cause it now seems in fact as if things are beginning to move in the right direction and what has been achieved in this respect may be entirely ascribed to the dalai lama's consistent policy of nonviolence for perfectly understandable reasons the policy of nonviolence is often regarded as something negative as a failure to formulate a well considered strategy as a lack of initiative and a tendency to evade the issue and adopt a passive attitude but this is not so the policy of nonviolence is to a very high degree a well thought out combat strategy it demands singleminded and purposeful action but one that eschews the use of force those_who adopt this strategy are by no means shirking the issue they manifest a moral courage which when all is said and done exceeds that of men who resort to arms it is courage of this kind together with an incredible measure of self discipline that has characterised the attitude of the dalai_lama his policy of nonviolence too has been carefully considered and determined as he himself put it in april of last year after a peaceful demonstration in lhasa has been fired on by troops as i have explained on many occasions nonviolence is for us the only way quite patently in our case violence would be tantamount to suicide for this reason whether we like it or not nonviolence is the only approach and the right one we only need more patience and determination in 1987 the dalai_lama submitted a peace plan for tibet the gist of which was that tibet should be given the status of a peace zone on a par with what had been proposed for nepal a proposal which the chinese in fact have supported the plan also envisaged a halt to chinese immigration to tibet this has proceeded on such a scale that there is a risk of the tibetans becoming a minority in their own_country not least interesting is the fact that the plan also contains measures for the conservation of tibet's unique natural environment wholesale logging operations in the forests on the slopes of the himalayas have resulted in catastrophic soil erosion and are one of the causes of the flood disasters suffered by india and bangladesh the peace plan failed to initiate any negotiations with the chinese even_though the discrepancies between the two sides were not particularly profound the dalai lama's willingness to compromise was expressed still more clearly in his address to the european parliament on june 15th last year where he stated his readiness to abandon claims for full tibetan independence he acknowledged that china as an asian superpower had strategic interests in tibet and was prepared to accept a chinese military presence at any_rate until such time as a regional peace plan could be adopted he also expressed his willingness to leave foreign_policy and defence in the hands of the chinese in return the tibetans should be granted the right to full internal autonomy in his efforts to promote peace the dalai_lama has shown that what he aims to achieve is not a power base at the expense of others he claims no more for his people than what everybody no_doubt the chinese themselves recognises as elementary human_rights in a world in which suspicion and aggression have all too long characterised relations_between peoples and nations and where the only realistic policy has been reliance on the use of power a new confession of faith is emerging namely that the least realistic of all solutions to conflict is the consistent use of force modern weapons have in fact excluded such solutions the world has shrunk increasingly peoples and nations have grown dependent on one another no one can any longer act entirely in his own interest it is therefore imperative that we should accept mutual responsibility for all political economic and ecological problems in view of this fewer and fewer people would venture to dismiss the dalai lama's philosophy as utopian on the contrary one would be increasingly justified in asserting that his gospel of nonviolence is the truly realistic one with most promise for the future and this applies not only to tibet but to each and every conflict the future hopes of oppressed millions are today linked to the unarmed battalions for they will win the peace the justice of their demands moreover is now so clear and the normal strength of their struggle so indomitable that they can only temporarily be halted by force of arms in awarding the peace_prize to h.h the dalai_lama we affirm our unstinting support for his work for peace and for the unarmed masses on the march in many lands for liberty peace and human_dignity your_royal highnesses_your excellencies_ladies and gentlemen this_year's nobel peace_prize has been awarded to the president of the soviet_union mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev the norwegian_nobel committee has made this award in recognition of the leading role he has played in the radical changes that have taken_place in east west relations president gorbachev has undoubtedly cooperated with other persons and other nations but we recognise quite clearly that his manifold personal contributions and his efforts on_behalf of the soviet_union have proved decisive for this reason the nobel_committee has in 1990 decided to honour him we are experiencing dramatic changes in a world that is still rent with conflict nevertheless we also have clear evidence that a peace process has started east and west the two mighty power blocs have managed to abandon their life threatening confrontation and have instead embarked on the long and patient road to cooperation on the basis of negotiation the task now is to create a peaceful framework for the far_reaching transformation which will inevitably continue to take place in our part of the world we have already seen the fruits of this new climate between east and west ancient european nations such as poland czechoslovakia hungary and now east germany too have regained their freedom and have for better or for worse assumed responsibility for their own national destiny even_though this process of detente still has its problems and is yet not terminated in all parts of our continent of europe it is nevertheless possible today maybe for the first time in many hundreds of years to envisage a europe of the people and we hope also a europe at peace this is due not least to the fact that the armaments race is ebbing out in our part of the globe in mistrust and fear this race has been going on for close on half a century the result has been a terrifying waste of intellectual and material resources on both_sides of the iron curtain here too we now at last see a change comprehensive negotiations bilateral as well as multilateral accompanied by concrete and realistic compromise have led to a process involving substantial reductions in standing_armies and death dealing armaments within the last few months disarmament agreements have been reached which are without parallel in our part of the world in this or indeed in previous centuries in making this_year's award of the peace_prize the nobel_committee wishes to emphasise the tremendous potential which is now available for a more secure world and for a more responsible and rational use of our resources the way in which confrontation has been replaced by cooperation has also had its consequences in other parts of the world several regional conflicts have been resolved or at least come closer to a solution the uncompromising attitude of the cold_war has given way to a pattern of negotiation in which the interests and responsibility of the regional communities themselves have replaced old ideological considerations or the all too often ruthless laws of the balance of power these changes have given the united_nations a new lease of life for the first time since its creation after the second_world war this organisation has been able to play the role for which it was originally intended it can now start to exercise its supremely important responsibility for the creation of an international community based_on the rule of law and the establishment of peace between nations the award this year of the peace_prize to the president of the soviet_union mikhail_gorbachev is an historic event not least because some of the previous awards made by our committee for example to the great champion of human_rights andrei_sakharov in 1975 and to the trade_union leader lech_walesa in 1983 were received with cool hostility in the soviet_union and in poland at the time involving the rejection in these countries of all that the norwegian_nobel committee stood for on these grounds too the award constitutes a landmark the norwegian_nobel committee considers that there is thus a historical link between today's event and december 10th 1975 and 1983 which augurs well for the future the norwegian_nobel committee is an independent organisation answerable neither to the government nor to the national assembly the storting of our country the five members of the committee are only answerable to their own consciences and their decisions are based_on the personal political judgment and sound common sense of each one the guidelines governing our work are nevertheless clearly set out these are to be found in alfred_nobel's testament written nearly a hundred years_ago the award this year is very much in line with alfred_nobel's own wishes and desires nobel wanted the prize to be awarded to someone who had worked to promote fraternity_between nations that was the expression generally used in his day to denote the substitution of international cooperation for conflict nobel also wished his prize to be given to someone who had actively promoted a reduction in standing_armies and worked for the holding of peace congresses what we today would call disarmament and negotiation seldom has our committee felt more in tune with alfred_nobel's wishes than this year it is with a special sense of satisfaction that we award the peace_prize to president gorbachev each one of us maybe in our different ways has experienced the tension and threat of war that have cast a dark shadow over all the post war years the new found openness and willingness to cooperate shown by the soviet_union and its readiness to accept realistic compromise have created fresh hope under his leadership we fully realise that the soviet_union is undergoing a dramatic period of transformation within its own borders dictatorship is to be replaced by greater democracy centralisation by the right of each republic for self determination a command economy by a freer market this transformation is inevitably a painful process involving great sacrifice but we should like the many peoples of the soviet_union to know that the respect and expectation of the outside world for their great country have never been as profound as today there has been nothing comparable since the great patriotic war which this country and our western allies fought together against the barbarism of national socialism at that time the road that led from world war to cold_war proved disappointingly short it is our hope that we are now celebrating the end of the cold_war mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev was born in 1931 in a small village just outside stavropol north of the caucasus mountains in a region that forms part of the russian republic adjoining the ancient non russian countries of georgia armenia and azerbaijan with their profound christian and muslim roots our laureate is in fact a native of the southern soviet_union he comes of peasant stock and was born 14 years after the great revolution which shook not only the russian empire but the entire world he was born during the dramatic collectivisation of soviet agriculture and grew_up on a collective farm where his father worked at a tractor station he was an eight year old schoolboy when the last world war_broke out and only 10 years old when germany attacked the soviet_union his schooling was both sporadic and limited by wartime conditions he was forced to work as a replacement for soldiers fighting at the front when peace came he was 14 years old and was able to continue his education but in common with most young people of his age worked during his summer holidays he was soon involved in the communist party's youth organisation and was rapidly promoted as a matter of course he joined the communist_party at the age of 21 two years before he had left his native village in the northern caucasus and made his way to the capital to embark on the study of law at the university of moscow here he not only met raisa titorenko who subsequently became his wife but was also active in the communist_party student movement with responsibility for ideology and propaganda among fellow students in his faculty he took a degree in law and then returned to stavropol where he was employed full time in the communist youth movement by the age of 25 he was in fact a member of the establishment with agricultural questions as his chief concern in 1967 he took a second degree this time in agriculture and was rapidly promoted in the local party hierarchy by the 1970s this_year's laureate was active politically on the national scene his breakthrough came in 1978 when at the age of 47 he was given joint responsibility for the entire agricultural set_up of the soviet_union in the communist party's secretariat in moscow which meant permanent residence in the capital seven years later he was elected leader of the soviet union's communist_party the most influential post in the country this was in 1985 by which time he was 54 years old he is now a figure of international prominence while still retaining the position of party secretary he is also elected_president of the soviet_union by a reformed parliament although mikhail_gorbachev is a man of quite outstanding talent and ability he insisted recently that the story of his own family is actually history itself or in other words the history of the soviet_union gorbachev is in fact a child of the revolution and the world war of lenin's stalin's khrushchev's and breshnev's soviet_union and like most people in this world he is a product of the society in which he grew_up today this soviet society is a historical experiment which is being shaken to its foundations and this is so not least because mikhail_gorbachev was also capable of breaking the mould of the society from which he sprang or as he personally expressed it in the televised interview in which he spoke of the perestroika which he symbolises we came to the conclusion that we could no_longer continue to live the way we were we needed major changes in every department of life our laureate has in fact been a communist all his life and he still is to this day even_though this might shock us as he declared in an interview he recently gave in the usa we are not really so shocked but this is neither the time nor the place to discuss the soviet union's internal affairs the norwegian_nobel committee has given president gorbachev the peace_prize for his leading role in international politics our committee has nonetheless observed one aspect of life in the soviet_union the much greater openness president gorbachev has introduced this has to a very large_extent helped to promote international confidence greater openness has in many ways ensured a basis for the comprehensive agreements on disarmament and cooperation between east and west that we are witnessing today an entire world is today watching the soviet union's dramatic and heroic struggle to overcome the awesome economic social and political problems which shake the country the norwegian_nobel committee not least is also watching it is our wish that the award of the peace_prize to its president mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev will be recognised as a helping_hand in an hour of need as a greeting to all the peoples of the soviet_union as a sign that the outside world is watching their struggle with a sense of fellow feeling and with a sense of participating in the historical events that are taking place it has been suggested that the award of this_year's prize to the president of the soviet_union by the nobel_committee was somewhat bold our boldness is however nothing like the boldness shown by mikhail_gorbachev when he embarked on the course which has today led to the receipt of the nobel peace_prize or the boldness shown by the many peoples of the soviet_union too in rewriting history from nobel lectures peace 1981 1990 editor in charge tore frängsmyr editor irwin abrams world scientific publishing co singapore 1997 your_majesties your_excellencies ladies and gentlemen we are assembled here_today to honour aung_san suu_kyi for her outstanding work for democracy and human_rights and to present to her the nobel peace_prize for 1991 the occasion gives rise to many and partly conflicting emotions the peace_prize laureate is unable to be here herself the great work we are acknowledging has yet to be concluded she is still fighting the good fight her courage and commitment find her a prisoner of conscience in her own_country burma her absence fills us with fear and anxiety which can nevertheless only be a faint shadow of the fear and anxiety felt by her family we welcome this opportunity of expressing our deepest sympathy with them with her husband michael aris and with her sons alexander and kim we feel with you and we are very grateful to you for coming to oslo to receive the nobel prize on_behalf of your wife and mother our fear and anxiety are mixed with a sense of confidence and hope in the good fight for peace and reconciliation we are dependent on persons who set examples persons who can symbolise what we are seeking and mobilise the best in us aung_san suu_kyi is just such a person she unites deep commitment and tenacity with a vision in which the end and the means form a single unit its most_important elements are democracy respect for human_rights reconciliation between groups non_violence and personal and collective discipline she has herself clearly indicated the sources of her inspiration principally mahatma_gandhi and her father aung_san the leader in burma's struggle for liberation the philosopher of non_violence and the general differ in many respects but also show fundamental similarities in both one can see genuine independence true modesty and a profound simplicity to use aung_san suu kyi's own words about her father to aung_san leadership was a duty and could only be carried_out on the basis of humility in face of the task before him and the confidence and respect of the people to be led while no_doubt deriving a great_deal of inspiration from gandhi and her father aung_san suu_kyi has also added her own independent reflections to what has become her political platform the keynote is the same profound simplicity as she sees in her father the central position given to human_rights in her thinking appears to reflect a real sense of the need to protect human_dignity man is not only entitled to live in a free society he also has a right to respect on this platform she has built a policy marked by an extraordinary combination of sober realism and visionary idealism and in her case this is more_than just a theory she has gone a long way towards showing how such a doctrine can be translated_into practical politics for a doctrine of peace and reconciliation to be translated_into practice one absolute condition is fearlessness aung_san suu_kyi knows this one of her essays opens with the statement that it is not power that corrupts but fear 1 the comment was aimed_at the totalitarian regime in her own_country they have allowed themselves to be corrupted because they fear the people they are supposed to lead this has led them into a vicious_circle in her thinking however the demand for fearlessness is first and foremost a general demand a demand on all of us she has herself shown fearlessness in practice she opposed herself alone to the rifle barrels can anything withstand such courage what was in that major's mind when at the last moment he gave the order not to fire perhaps he was impressed by her bravery perhaps he realised that nothing can be achieved by brute force 2 violence is its own worst enemy and fearlessness is the sharpest weapon against it it is not least aung_san suu kyi's impressive courage which makes her such a potent symbol like gandhi and her father aung_san aung_san was shot in the midst of his struggle but if those_who arranged the assassination thought it would remove him from burmese politics they were wrong he became the unifying symbol of a free burma and an inspiration to those_who are now fighting for a free society in addition to his example and inspiration his position among his people over forty_years after his death gave aung_san suu_kyi the political point of departure she needed she has indeed taken up her inheritance and is now in her own right the symbol of the revolt against violence and the struggle for a free society not only in burma but also in the rest of asia and in many other parts of the world we ordinary people i believe feel that with her courage and her high ideals aung_san suu_kyi brings out something of the best in us we feel we need precisely her sort of person in order to retain our faith in the future that is what gives her such power as a symbol and that is why any illtreatment of her feels like a violation of what we have most at heart the little woman under house arrest stands for a positive hope knowing she is there gives us confidence and faith in the power of good aung_san suu_kyi was born in 1945 her father was killed when she was two she has no personal memories of him her mother was a diplomat and aung_san suu_kyi was to spend many of her early years and much of her later life abroad in 1967 she took a degree in politics philosophy and economics at st hugh's college oxford from 1969 on she worked for two years for the united_nations in new_york in 1972 she married michael aris a british specialist on tibet for a time the family lived in bhutan but in the mid seventies they moved back to oxford in addition to being a housewife with two small children aung_san suu_kyi kept up her academic work gradually concentrating on modern burmese history and literature she was a visiting scholar at kyoto university in japan and at the indian institute of advanced studies in new delhi on her return to burma in 1988 she broke off her studies at the london school of oriental and african studies there is little in these outward events to suggest the role she was to embark on in 1988 but she was well prepared there is a great_deal of evidence that the fate of her own people had constantly weighed on her mind her husband has told us how she often reminded him that one day she would have to return to burma and that she would count on his support 3 her studies too as we have seen became increasingly concentrated on burma's modern history the study of her father and the part he played in burmese history no_doubt increased her political commitment and sense that his mantle had fallen on her 4 in moving to japan she was virtually following in her father's footsteps during the second_world war it was from a base in japan that aung_san built up burma's independent national army when japan invaded burma aung_san and his men went too before long they switched from fighting the british colonial power to resisting the occupying japanese and supporting the retaking of burma by the allies after the war he led the negotiations with the british which were to lead to final independence aung_san suu_kyi appears to have felt an urgent need to study the process which led to burma's independent statehood and to understand the ideals governing the politics in a beautiful essay comparing the indian and burmese experience of colonisation she also brings out the special features of burma's cultural heritage 5 history is important you choose who you are by choosing which tradition you belong to aung_san suu_kyi seeks to call attention to what she sees as the best aspects of the national and cultural heritage and to identify herself with them such profound knowledge and such a deep sense of identity are an irresistible force in the political struggle the occasion of aung_san suu kyi's return to burma in 1988 was characteristically enough not the political situation but her old mother's illness the political turbulence had just begun however there had been demonstrations and confrontations with the police with some two hundred killed the unrest continued while she was nursing her dying mother that was the situation in which she resolved to take an active_part in what she herself called the second struggle for national independence the military regime had seized power in burma in 1962 the disturbances which broke_out in 1988 were a reaction to growing repression in the summer of that year at a time when the situation was very uncertain aung_san suu_kyi intervened with a open_letter to the government proposing the appointment of a consultative committee of respected independent persons to lead the country into multi party elections in the letter she emphasised the need for discipline and for refraining from the use of force on either side and demanded the release of political prisoners 6 a couple of days later she addressed several_hundred thousand people in front of the large shwedagon pagoda in rangoon presenting a political program based_on human_rights democracy and non_violence on the 18th of september after hesitating for a few weeks the armed_forces reacted by tightening the restrictions the so_called state law and order restoration council slorc was established and martial law was introduced under which meetings were banned and persons could be sentenced without trial political parties were not prohibited perhaps with meetings banned it was thought unnecessary a week after the establishment of slorc aung_san suu_kyi and a few other members of the opposition founded the national league for democracy the nld she went on to engage in vigorous political activity defying the ban on meetings and military provocations and holding heavily attended political meetings all over the country one remarkable feature of her political campaign was the appeal she had for the country's various ethnic groups traditionally at odds with each_other it must have been her personal prestige which caused the regime to hesitate so long but in july 1989 she was placed under house arrest in may 1990 elections were held in which the nld won an overwhelming victory and over 80 per_cent of the seats in the national assembly there is general agreement that this was principally a triumph for aung_san suu_kyi why did the slorc allow free elections probably because they expected a very different result a result which would somehow have provided the legitimacy they needed to retain power the dilemma of such regimes was demonstrated trapped in their own lies at any_rate they refused to accept the election result the election was in effect annulled the slorc continued but with reduced legitimacy lack of legitimacy is often made up for by increased brutality amnesty_international has reported continuing serious violations of human_rights 7 today the burmese regime appears to have developed into one of the most repressive in the world in recent decades the norwegian_nobel committee has awarded a number of prizes for peace in recognition of work for human_rights 8 it has done so in the conviction that a fundamental prerequisite for peace is the recognition of the right of all people to life and to respect another motivation lies in the knowledge that in its most basic form the concept of human_rights is not just a western idea but common to all major cultures permit_me in this connection to quote a paragraph of aung_san suu kyi's essay in quest of democracy where there is no justice there can be no secure peace that just laws which uphold human_rights are the necessary foundations of peace and security would be denied only by closed minds which interpret peace as the silence of all opposition and security as the assurance of their own power the burmese associate peace and security with coolness and shade the shade of a tree is cool indeed the shade of parents is cooler the shade of teachers is cooler still the shade of the ruler is yet more cool but coolest of all is the shade of the buddha's teachings thus to provide the people with the protective coolness of peace and security rulers must observe the teachings of the buddha central to these teachings are the concepts of truth righteousness and loving kindness it is government based_on these very qualities that the people of burma are seeking in their struggle for democracy 9 this is not the first time that political persecution at home has prevented a peace_prize laureate from receiving the prize in person it happened to carl_von ossietzky in 1936 ill in one of hitler's concentration_camps 10 it happened to andrei_sakharov and to lech_walesa ossietzky died before the regime fell but sakharov and walesa saw their struggles succeed 11 it is our hope that aung_san suu_kyi will see her struggle crowned with success however we must also face up to the likelihood that this will not be the last occasion on which a peace_prize laureate is unable to attend let that remind us that in a world such as ours peace and reconciliation cannot be achieved once and for all we will never be able to lower our standards on the contrary a better world demands even greater vigilance of us still greater fearlessness and the ability to develop in ourselves the profound simplicity of which this_year's laureate has spoken this applies to all of us as individuals but must apply especially to those in positions of power and authority show humility and show fearlessness like aung_san suu_kyi the result may be a better world to live in your_majesties your_excellencies ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee decided to award the nobel peace_prize for 1992 to rigoberta_menchú tum it is a particular pleasure for us to welcome you rigoberta_menchú tum here in oslo to receive the award welcome to this little winter country in the far north so far from your own_country and your own world the distance both geographically and culturally is vast but the occasion of this award in particular should prompt us to think about nearness wherever in the world they take place conflicts and wars have in our time become the whole world's concern even at this distance we feel threatened by a local conflict in guatemala not militarily but because it affects the world's future the situation in guatemala acquires a special significance because it is such a clear case of general problem that we must all contribute to solving i refer to such matters as ethnic and racial segregation the rights of aboriginal peoples the environment and the sharing of resources the gap between the poor and rich i refer to the role of women in society the path guatemala takes in all these respects is important to us so we commit ourselves nearness has another aspect to it however which a person like rigoberta_menchú tum obliges us to think about it appears in the general humanity of our deepest needs our dreams of peace and reconciliation our longing for the good life our right to live and to be respected we have needs and we have rights simply by virtue of our humanity across ethnic cultural and geographical divides a moment like the present also serves to remind us of this nearness inherent in our common humanity by maintaining a disarming humanity in a brutal world rigoberta_menchú tum appeals to the best in all of us wherever we live and whatever our background she stands as a uniquely potent symbol of a just struggle rigoberta_menchú tum is a quiché indian she was born in a poor indian village in the guatemala mountains and grew_up in the indian culture only learning spanish as an adult as she describes her childhood in her autobiography it was marked by great closeness in the family and in the village but also by extreme poverty in order not to starve she was forced as a child to join in the cotton picking on the big plantations where the indians were treated little better than animals i started thinking about my childhood she writes in the autobiography and i came to the conclusion that i hadn't had a childhood at all i was never a child i hadn't been to school i hadn't had enough food to grow properly i had nothing i asked myself how is this possible this is her account of how at an early_age awareness began growing on her of the road she must take in life how will a world turn out that steals childhood from children that is a question we must ask ourselves today a few people nevertheless seem to be born with reserves of inner strength and humanity that defy the worst conditions what such people have to tell us is worth listening to rigoberta_menchú tum was to experience the confiscation of indian land her village was one of several_hundred that were levelled to the ground massacres were normal guatemala acquired a civilian government in 1982 but even so innumerable massacres have been registered since then in rural districts several_hundred mass graves are known since the beginning of this year alone american and canadian human_rights organisations have registered 380 summary executions and 80 cases of torture the guerrillas themselves a response to the brutal expulsion from the land have in their turn been used as an excuse for a blind brutalisation of the whole society that extreme brutalisation struck at rigoberta_menchú tum's own family her father who was the elected leader of his village was active in starting the cuc the committee of the peasant union which soon won widespread support he was burnt to death her mother and brother were bestially tortured and killed by the military it is five hundred years this year since columbus discovered america as we have been brought up to say or since colonisation began the celebration of the anniversary has at least produced one benefit in the spotlight it has so effectively focussed on the worldwide problem of the rights of aboriginal peoples developments in america demonstrate the problem more clearly than anywhere else this was a whole continent the population of which in columbus's day may have numbered as many as 100 million today only a fraction of these indian peoples survive and any truly indian culture can only be found isolated in small pockets why was the indian culture less able than others to resist the european pressure any processes elsewhere resembling the one in america have only taken_place in more marginal areas of the world such processes are complex and this is not the place for a more detailed analysis what is clear however is that at certain times and in certain places we are confronted by a different force from infectious diseases and mortality or the haphazard outcome of wars and rapacity and that is the systemic ethnic cleansing of the aboriginal population better known as genocide there is a most urgent need to define the rights of aboriginal peoples and to respect those rights in a manner which makes it possible to live in peace and mutual understanding to succeed in this we need people like rigoberta_menchú tum for the norwegian_nobel committee it was a happy coincidence that it was precisely in the year of columbus that she emerged as such a strong candidate for the nobel peace_prize rigoberta_menchú tum chose to dedicate herself to political and social work for her people in charming and characteristically forthright terms she tells_us in her autobiography what a difficult choice it was not to have a family she was engaged she tells_us and felt an obligation to the ancestral principle of seeking happiness not only for oneself but for one's family a threat of ethnic cleansing of course lends extra weight to such an obligation but she chose otherwise i was very confused she writes society and so many other_things wouldn't leave me alone i always had a heavy heart she became an active member of the cuc then she participated in the founding of the organisation called the revolutionary christians we understood revolutionary in the real meaning of the word transformation if i had chosen the armed struggle i would be in the mountains now owing to her political activity she has had to spend twelve years in exile in mexico she became one of the first indian delegates to the united_nations and is a member of the un group that works for human_rights and the cause of the indian peoples in her book a strategy for peace the swedish american moral philosopher sissela bok describes what she calls the pathology of partisanship or the brutalising effect of the use of violence whoever commits acts of violence will lose his humanity thus violence breeds violence and hate breeds hate she quotes the english poet stephen spender who experienced this process in himself when he took_part in the spanish civil war it was clear to me that unless i cared about every murdered child impartially i did not care about children being murdered at all 1 but how can one break_out of the vicious_circle of the pathology of partisanship it is easy enough to keep out and call for non_violence or an end to hatred when one is not oneself confronted with the blind violence of the other side nor is it indeed our responsibility to judge or to condemn in such cases what we can do however is to point to the shining individual examples of people who manage to preserve their humanity in brutal and violent surroundings of persons who for that very reason compel our special respect and admiration such people give us a hope that there are ways out of the vicious_circle i have had occasion to mention rigoberta_menchú tum's autobiography a number of times it is an extraordinary human document it describes cruelty in sober and matter of fact terms its driving_force is moral indignation in some connections she also mentions her hatred of those responsible for the violence and repression but at the same_time the account reflects a disarming humanity almost gaily she notes funny little concrete details in an otherwise ruthless existence with love she describes indian customs i know no better example of her disarming attitude than her description here in oslo last year of her meeting with colonel roderigues we greeted each_other and exchanged a few words the man who killed my mother congratulated me on my nomination for the nobel peace_prize and called it a national honour i realised then that at bottom we are all human_beings it was like meeting a distant acquaintance i had a feeling of calm as i spoke to him it is stupid to meet the world with too much trust but even more stupid to meet it with too little the goal of rigoberta_menchú tum's work as she has said on many occasions is reconciliation and peace she knows better than most that the foundations for future reconciliation are laid in the manner in which one conducts one's struggle even in the most brutal situations one must retain one's faith that there is a minimum of human feelings in all of us rigoberta_menchú tum preserved that faith it is with the deepest respect and in admiration of her efforts that the norwegian_nobel committee today awards her the nobel peace_prize thank_you your_majesties excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has decided to award the nobel peace_prize for 1993 to nelson r mandela and frederik willem de_klerk for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid_regime and for laying the foundations for a new democratic south_africa it is a great pleasure to be able to welcome the two prize_winners here_today this is the third time the nobel_committee has awarded the prize to human_rights advocates who have actively participated in the struggle_against the apartheid_regime in south_africa there are many reasons why south_africa has attracted so much attention after the second_world war and the fall of the hitler regime racism as a system was thoroughly discredited the general trend was to remove institutionalised racial barriers at the same_time as the old colonial empires were being dismantled but just when this was the general trend south_africa chose to move in the opposite direction from 1948 onwards the apartheid_regime was consolidated and systematically through legislation and organisational forms developed into a brutal regime of oppression based_on criteria of race alone thus it also became the symbol of a particularly debasing form of oppression the apartheid_regime gave racism a face when anc leader albert_lutuli was awarded the nobel peace_prize for 1960 more_than a generation ago he drew attention to the systematic institutionalised undermining of human equality as a christian lutuli anchored the idea of equality in his religious beliefs as a christian and patriot i could not look while systematic attempts were made almost in every department of life to debase the god factor in man or to set a limit beyond which the human being in his black form might not strive to serve his creator to the best of his ability to remain neutral in a situation where the laws of the land virtually criticised god for having created men of colour was the sort of thing i could not as a christian tolerate 1 by awarding the prize for 1960 to lutuli the norwegian_nobel committee initiated what was in some regards a new policy from then on the struggle for human_rights became a much more important criterion for awarding the peace_prize than it had been previously this criterion has been controversial for it has been pointed_out that work for human_rights has created conflicts in many areas on the surface and in the short term this is true but it also seems true that on the whole the committee's policy has gained widespread support throughout the world and within different cultures if anything close to a stable peace is to be achieved respect for each other's character integrity and dignity is an absolute requirement this is an important point in immanuel kant's famous 200 year old essay on everlasting peace 2 he links peace to the idea of justice which was the cornerstone of his political philosophy during the cold_war and with the type of ideologicallybased oppression that existed in the totalitarian regimes then one could have been led to believe that peace was dependent on the balance of terror and that oppression created stability these must have been the thoughts motivating those_who criticised any consideration of the struggle for human_rights as work for peace today we know that these regimes of oppression were the most fragile they did not yield freedom nor did they offer stability the breaches of the most fundamental human_rights and the systematic undermining of human_dignity and self respect were bound to give rise to opposition such regimes always find themselves in a vicious_circle sooner or later facing the danger of disintegration into wars chaos and bloodshed south_africa had long been caught up in such a vicious_circle however on the eve of the 1990 s the regime reversed its policies under its new president frederik willem de_klerk nelson_mandela was released unconditionally after nearly 28 years of imprisonment and the dismantling of apartheid became the official policy of the regime to what degree this was a strategic adjustment to a situation characterised by internal dissolution or the fruits of moral reflection as well each individual participant must determine for himself south_africa had long been caught up in a vicious_circle and only time can show whether these initiatives came too late the natural partner in the negotiations that were initiated was the anc whose leader nelson_mandela went straight from prison to the negotiating table mandela had early taken a stand as an active opponent of apartheid initially he was among those_who were inspired by gandhi's methods of nonviolence but the climate hardened inexorably as the sharpeville massacre of 1960 showed 3 in 1962 mandela was imprisoned and his confinement would last almost 28 years some months after his release in 1990 we had the pleasure of receiving mandela here in oslo to the so_called hate conference organised by the nobel_committee in cooperation with the elie_wiesel foundation 4 it was a conference which enjoyed the participation of an exceptional group of outstanding men and women and in this setting nelson_mandela stood out he spoke with a moral authority and in a constructive tone that made a profound impression this is my personal recollection but i know that i was not alone in feeling this many people have remarked on the apparent lack of bitterness that characterises mandela's conduct since he was released from prison he himself has said that perhaps he would have harboured bitter thoughts if he had not had a job to do then he adds as an afterthought that if only all those_who have made such great sacrifices for the sake of justice could see that they have not been in vain that would serve to eliminate the bitterness from their hearts the two prize_winners from their highly disparate points of departure the one from the side of the oppressors and the other from the side of the oppressed have taken initiatives to break the vicious_circle that their country was caught up in these are initiatives the world has taken note of initiatives which reflect personal integrity and great political courage on the part of both men they have both chosen not to dwell on the deep wounds of the past in so doing they are different from leaders in many other conflict areas even_though the wounds in south_africa were deeper than perhaps anywhere else mandela and de_klerk have chosen reconciliation rather_than the alternative which would inevitably have been an ever more bitter and bloodier conflict another aspect of the policy of reconciliation is compromise and the recognition that one must give in order to be able to take political action on this basis reflects the highest political virtue but in order to attain success all parties must be willing to sacrifice eminent statesmanship has been demonstrated in south_africa and it is astonishing what has been achieved since mandela was released in 1990 the institutionalised apartheid_regime has been dismantled a provisional constitution has been adopted a broadly based transitional executive council has been established the date for fully democratic elections has been set 5 there can be no_doubt that the main credit for these highly significant steps towards a peaceful transition to a democratic south_africa is due to these two prize_winners yet we know that the process is not finished the danger of setbacks exists there are groups who are not party to or who have withdrawn from the negotiations south_africa today is still a society marked by bitterness fear and violence the number of people killed while the negotiations have taken_place is in the tens of thousands the vicious_circle has not been decisively broken thus there are today two competing trends conflict and reconciliation in the ongoing process it is vital that all parties demonstrate their goodwill by doing their utmost to bring the violence to an end it is also essential that the groups now outside the negotiations are drawn into active participation in the continuing process of reconciliation and compromise there is an unquestionable need for more statesmanship should we then have waited to award the prize until the definitive breakthrough of the policy of reconciliation some would say so however the question is whether it makes sense to talk of a definitive breakthrough work for peace and reconciliation requires ceaseless effort slackening off means opening for new conflicts thus the norwegian_nobel committee when awarding the nobel peace_prize will always have to enter into processes in one way or another in his will nobel wrote that the prize should be given to the person or persons who in the preceding year have contributed the most for the benefit of peace it is the conviction of the committee that nelson r mandela and frederik willem de_klerk have made a brilliant contribution and attained astonishing results with their policy of peace and reconciliation they have given peace a chance whether peace will prevail time will have to show alfred_nobel also intended the institution of the peace_prize itself to represent a positive contribution to peace thus it is the hope of the nobel_committee that this_year's award will serve as a contribution however small for the peaceful development towards complete democracy in south_africa it is the privilege of the norwegian_nobel committee to award the nobel peace_prize we do so in admiration and deep respect for those_who manage to maintain their humanity in a world characterised by fear and brutality who assume the responsibility to do something about the problems and who succeed in doing so the policy of reconciliation that nelson r mandela and frederik willem de_klerk represent provides hope not only for south_africa it is also a shining example for the world that there are ways out of the vicious_circle of violence and bitterness from nobel lectures peace 1991 1995 editor irwin abrams world scientific publishing co singapore 1999 your_majesties your_excellencies ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has decided to award the nobel peace_prize for 1994 in alphabetical order to yasser arafat shimon peres and yitzhak rabin for their efforts to create peace in the middle_east it is a great pleasure for us to be able to welcome all three laureates here_today we know that they are all heavily engaged in complicated political processes we therefore set all the more store by your having taken the time to come so far north to our wintry little country to receive the peace_prize that the fate of the middle_east attracts so much global attention is no coincidence the conflict or conflicts in the middle_east concern us all in a very special way the middle_east is where africa asia and europe meet it is where several major religions had their roots the middle_east is therefore the mirror where the world sees itself reflected the way conflicts are resolved there or not resolved are an example creating hope or extinguishing it in other regions that is why developments and not least the activities of our laureates are watched with such anxious attention permit_me to strike a brief personal note raised as we were in norway's protestant christian tradition we had drilled into us already in primary school the history and geography of two countries norway and palestine when i visited the middle_east for the first time ten_years ago it felt like coming to a country i had known for a long time it was not just that i had learned its complex and bloody history from the bible with a child's imagination i had also built up memories of the country jerusalem and jericho were places where i had been at the same_time i bore within me the deep spiritual unrest which awareness of the holocaust created in us europeans the world community's support for the establishment of the state israel was intended to right and probably did right some of the wrongs committed yet i felt more unrest creeping into my mind not least at the sight of the deserted refugee camp near jericho testimony that once_again a people had taken to flight is there no end to this history can no injustice be righted without creating more injustice critics of this_year's choice of laureates have said that the nobel_committee is so distant from the conflict that it cannot understand it perhaps probably only those_who live in the midst of the conflict know what that means on the other_hand solutions may be easier to see for those_who have a wider view and can watch events in ibsen's1 words through a hollowed hand to gain a better perspective the problem is rather that it is so difficult to reconcile these perspectives but that is exactly what this_year's laureates have done although living in the conflict they have retained the ability to look beyond it in the committee's view the so_called oslo accords2 concluded last year between israel and the plo meant that developments in the middle_east had taken a new turning what was revolutionary about them was the de facto mutual recognition by the two parties not least by virtue of that recognition the accords opened up a possible way out of the vicious_circle of violence breeding violence and towards peaceful co existence since the accords were concluded developments have become more dynamic this applies both to relations_between israel and the palestinian people and to relations_between israel and the neighbouring arab_states the oslo accords have as prime_minister rabin said at the press conference yesterday opened up for a normalization of relations with the entire world it has been said that the nobel_committee ought to have waited but to say that is to disregard what has already been achieved as a result of the oslo accords in all the areas mentioned besides if we had to wait for what kant3 in his famous essay called perpetual peace we might have to wait a long time peace has to be perpetually won that means that every award must contain an element of entering into a process a process with a promise of peace the nobel peace_prize is awarded both in recognition of efforts which have been made and to encourage still further efforts there can be no_doubt that that is also how alfred_nobel intended the prize to work the committee considers this_year's three laureates to have been the persons most responsible for the oslo accords and for following them up they watched the negotiations from day to day and took the difficult and fateful decisions on what concessions to make to the other party in a situation marked by war and hatred they had to take the risk of showing their opposite numbers at least a minimum of trust trust that the peace feelers were genuine confidence that if they offered an outstretched_hand there would be someone there to take it on that bet they staked their political lives that takes great courage for such negotiating games to succeed there has to be a kind of symmetry both_sides need to be able to feel that the give and take will end up roughly even it is chiefly thanks to the three laureates that this delicate balance has been achieved concession must be followed by concession or the process will come to a halt so far both parties have given a great_deal our hope as the process continues is that neither will be driven to breaking these rules of the game for various reasons which are none too clear and which i shall not consider here the world attaches considerable prestige to the nobel peace_prize that can make it all too tempting for the nobel_committee to slip as it were into moral judges robes we are indeed often called upon and from many quarters to be just that moral judges permit_me to note that we seek to perform our appointed duties with great humility for the distant viewer and perhaps especially for the distant viewer from a privileged and peaceful corner of the world it is so easy to moralise a bit too easy personally i_am convinced that one reason for the prestige won by the peace_prize is that moralising arrogance has been avoided in this way one has been able to support the real moral project peace the intention has been not to judge or to hand out certificates of good conduct but simply to reward practical work for peace in accordance_with nobel's own guidelines right from the start the committee has given practical peace work a broad definition the range extends from humanitarian work via work for human_rights to political action which helps to prevent or stop or resolve conflicts and it is precisely in this last important area that our laureates have intervened so forcefully and with such courage hatred and violence breed hatred and violence the middle_east was deep in that vicious_circle more and more minds seemed possessed by it but as we see there are some who are strong_enough to break_out who manage to stop to think who turn around and go back on their tracks in search of a basis for peaceful co existence perhaps they are the most deserving of respect and admiration were we not taught that such homecomings should be the cause of the greatest rejoicing on a previous occasion of this kind i recalled the reflections of the british poet and intellectual stephen spender when he took_part in the spanish civil war for him the fight_against fascism was a just cause but a point came when he stopped and discovered to his horror what a brutalising effect the war was having on him it was clear to me he wrote later that unless i cared about every murdered child impartially i did not care about children being murdered at all 4 spender was strong_enough to conduct that kind of cathartic selfexamination and to break_out of the vicious_circle he had been trapped in this is not attempt on my part to sum up the characters of our laureates much less to speculate about their deeper motives for doing what they have done which they may not even know themselves all i_am trying to do is to suggest how complex the situation is and how difficult it is to pass judgement but my main errand is different more limited but perhaps at least as important to call attention to the boldness and consistency of the political initiatives taken by the three laureates ever_since the opening of the oslo negotiations the three prize_winners are all in positions in which they have power to intervene in the course of events but their positions are also exposed despite that they have used them to attempt together to change the direction of developments to break_out of the vicious_circle of hatred and violence and to point out a path to reconciliation as leaders they represent and mobilise the longing for peace which of course exists in both peoples the past cannot be forgotten but one can take various attitudes to it one can choose to live in its shadow or to make use of its experience to build a better future our laureates have chosen the latter and so far they have succeeded developments have taken a new turning the situation is still full of tension marked by violence killings and insecurity and stability is still far to seek nevertheless our laureates have not only shown that a road to reconciliation can be found but also very bravely taken several steps down that road it is in admiration of that effort and in the hope that the process they have started will continue that they are today being awarded the nobel peace_prize your_majesties your_excellencies ladies and gentlemen our world has for fifty_years now been living in the knowledge that weapons exist powerful enough to wipe out human life on earth the atom bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki meant the end of the second_world war but also changed man's relation to his surroundings man's creature his liberating technology turned against him the huge threat was clear enough for anyone to see who could bear to look indeed the united_nations first resolution unanimously adopted by the general_assembly on the 24th of january 1946 concerned the establishment of a commission to propose the elimination of nuclear_arms and other weapons of mass destruction 1 it may be worth reminding one another of the fact that nuclear_weapons have been used in war admittedly in an extreme situation but not by an irrational despot or under the naïve illusion of their relative innocence extreme situations may arise again what guarantee is there that nuclear_weapons will not be used again in the short term the risk can be lessened by reducing nuclear arsenals but the longer term aim must be to destroy all such weapons as the united_nations argued in 1946 since we have no way of banning knowledge concerning nuclear_weapons the only guarantee that they will never be used is in the last analysis probably a world without war it is considerations of this nature which principally underlie the unwearying activity of our laureates in joseph rotblat's case since his departure from the manhattan project in 1944,2 and in the case of the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs since the first meeting in 1957 it is a great pleasure to me to welcome our peace_prize laureates we do so in admiration of your efforts over a long period of time and recognising that your activities remain as necessary today as they have ever been in his own eyes alfred_nobel was principally a practical man of science he also lived at a time of scientific optimism as many as three of the prizes he founded to be awarded to those whose work had been of the greatest benefit to mankind accordingly went to scientists ironically enough however his own scientific work was not unquestionably beneficial to humanity dynamite made more powerful weapons possible as the morally aware man he was nobel was troubled by this and in his efforts to justify his activity he also toyed with the doctrine of deterrence more powerful weapons would keep man from waging war when he wrote his will however exactly one hundred years_ago the peace he envisaged was of a completely different kind nothing is said about peace based_on fear deterrence or a balance of power the conditions for peace are now seen as disarmament and fraternity in other words the elimination of fear and the promotion of a peaceful mentality rooted in the human spirit it is work for this kind of peace that nobel wanted the norwegian_nobel committee to honour the will is based_on a concept of peace with a moral content that does_not mean discounting the need to take practical politics into account but is a reminder of their limitations and of the equally self_evident place of moral considerations in international politics as in any of this world's other complicated sets of circumstances to set any sector of human activity apart from the moral sphere is to deny our humanity without over doing the comparison we can see parallels between nobel and today's laureate joseph rotblat both were scientists who clearly recognised their responsibility as scientists to society rotblat is a prominent nuclear physicist who was quick to realise the alarming potential of releasing nuclear_energy during world war ii he took_part in realising that potential an activity which as a moral person he felt bound to justify by arguing that hitler must be prevented from developing an atom_bomb first when it became clear that hitler would be unable to develop a bomb rotblat left the manhattan project before it had achieved that object what this shows is not just a man with personal integrity and great moral courage but also the interesting idea that it was not necessary to develop the atom_bomb even when one knew that it was theoretically possible it was not necessary to let the genie out of the bottle man must not imagine that he has no choice when he can in fact choose however the genie was let out of the bottle since then alongside his commitment to nuclear disarmament rotblat has engaged in nuclear physics which when put to medicinal uses can find beneficial applications he has among other_things worked on radiation biology and the efforts of radiation rotblat has arrived at a critical view of the deterrence strategy with which he justified his original engagement in the manhattan project he was one of the eleven scientists who in 1955 signed the russell einstein manifesto drawn_up by bertrand russell and albert_einstein which told us that we must think in new ways to avoid military confrontations the results of which would be destructive to all parties the manifesto was the immediate point of departure for the pugwash movement rotblat has been the leading figure in that movement of which he is today at the age of 87 the very active president the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs are first and foremost an organisation of scientists this makes them one of the clearest manifestations of the independent social and moral responsibility of scientists for what they and they alone are capable of developing even today recognition of that responsibility is not a matter of course the message from pugwash to science is a double one it must engage actively in the struggle_against the harmful consequences of earlier scientific discoveries and it must assess in advance the consequences of new ones modern science is taking enormous strides the idea of its moral responsibility may be more relevant today than ever before it is characteristic of the pugwash movement that it has always combined ideals and long_term aims with concrete work aimed_at more immediate targets it has only to a limited extent sought public and media attention and it is not tied into the political decision making process what it has been able to make the most of is the fact that scientists have a shared frame of reference and speak the same language across ideological religious or national dividing lines at the countless conferences and seminars beld all over the world scientists and decision makers with different points of departure have got together to discuss strategies not only for nuclear disarmament but also for general disarmament and other ways of promoting peace although working largely behind the scenes the pugwash movement has been close to decision makers it has served as a channel of communication for them and by virtue of its expertise and insight a supplier of premises for their discussions the pugwash movement probably played a not insignificant part in the processes which led to such important arms limitation agreements as the nuclear test_ban treaty in 1963 the non_proliferation treaty in 1968 and salt i and the convention on biological weapons in 1972.3 through its unwearying long_term efforts it has also been a major contributor to the change of mentality so essential to the nuclear disarmament that has taken_place since the end of the cold_war start i and start ii and the agreement to make the non_proliferation treaty permanent have meant a significant reduction in the nuclear threat 4 but existing stocks remain far too large new nuclear_arms are still being tested and the danger that such weapons will spread remains considerable the pugwash movement has shown itself well able to adapt to the new world the pugwash conference in hiroshima this year said that although there were favourable developments the situation was unsettled we have opportunities but they must be grasped and made use of before developments again take an unfavourable turn precisely the kind of work that pugwash has been and is engaged in is therefore still just as necessary if not more necessary than ever before we are living today in what has been called the global village the fate of each one of us is intimately linked to world developments events on the other side of the world concern us as never before at the same_time the global village is what the german sociologist ulrich beck has called a risk society 5 we share a common fate in that we are all exposed to the same risk the same threats to our common environment this is creating an atmosphere of fundamental unease but what do we do when we see no chance of avoiding the danger in the long_run says beck we can stop thinking about it this eschatological ecofatalism allows the pendulum of private and political moods to swing in any direction the risk society shifts between hysteria and apathy the greatest achievement of our laureates may be that more distinctly and consistently than anyone_else they have steered clear of both pitfalls while painting a clear picture of the great dangers they have at the same_time insisted that there is a way out the have kept the vision of a nuclearfree world alive while working unwearyingly for specific arms limitation measures in the short term by doing so they have enabled us to adopt a rational attitude both to the dangerous situation and to our own disquiet the work which the two laureates joseph rotblat and the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs have done and are doing for disarmament and peace is considerable the norwegian_nobel committee_wishes to honour them for that work and at the same_time to express the hope that it will be continued so that the disarmament which has begun may at some future time really lead to a more peaceful world free from nuclear_arms from nobel lectures peace 1991 1995 editor irwin abrams world scientific publishing co singapore 1999 translation of the norwegian_text your_majesties presidents excellencies_ladies and gentlemen on_behalf of the norwegian_nobel committee may i extend to everyone a warm welcome to this_year's nobel peace_prize ceremony it is one hundred years to the day since alfred_nobel died a year earlier he had drawn_up his will in which he determined that his considerable wealth should provide for annual awards of five prizes three for science one for literature and one for peace to those whose work as he wrote shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind it was also laid_down in the will that the peace_prize should be awarded in norway by a committee appointed by the norwegian_storting our thoughts today go also to stockholm where the other awards are being made and where the centenary is being marked of the death of alfred_nobel nobel was of course an unusually successful businessman but that was not where his heart lay his happiest times were spent in the laboratory inventions it has been said became for him a way of life he was also very widely read he was in other words greatly interested indeed a believer in science and literature what was remarkable was his moral approach to those activities which he saw as opportunities for promoting a better world this perspective emerges most clearly in his decision concerning a peace_prize it can be argued that the invention of dynamite and concern at the more powerful weapons which it made possible contributed to his increasing commitment to peace but there were other impulses too impulses which appealed to his deeply rooted moral instincts first and foremost his contact_with the future peace_prize laureate bertha_von suttner and with the contemporary peace movement nobel left an important inheritance consisting of a vision of a better world and an award institution which was to contribute to the realisation of that vision we who have been entrusted with managing that inheritance do so in humility and with deep respect for the man alfred_nobel whose memory we honour today it is with great pleasure and in the conviction that with this_year's choice we have managed nobel's inheritance in the best possible way that we welcome our peace_prize laureates today carlos filipe ximenes belo and jose ramos_horta have been awarded the nobel peace_prize for 1996 for their long lasting efforts to achieve a just and peaceful_solution to the twenty year old conflict in east_timor to reach this peaceful winterland norway you have come about as far from your home country as it is possible to travel on this earth yet the distance between us is much shorter in miles than in opportunities for peace justice and reconciliation we are grateful and proud that in the middle of your important and self_sacrificing work you have found time for the journey here thereby giving us this opportunity to honour you the conflict in east_timor has been called the forgotten conflict it has not however been completely forgotten having figured on the international agenda with varying degrees of prominence throughout those twenty_years but it has so to speak never caught on there have been so many other interests and regards to attend to and east_timor is so small rarely has the cynicism of world politics been more clearly demonstrated the numerous considerations of realpolitik have enabled an exceptionally brutal form of neocolonialism to take place of a population of between six and seven hundred_thousand nearly two hundred_thousand have died as the direct or indirect result of the indonesian occupation and the violations are still taking place today many are the countries which have given higher priority to their realpolitical cooperation with indonesia than to regard for east_timor this is the apparently hopeless situation in which our two laureates have so untiringly striven for a just and peaceful arrangement for their people the autumn of 1975 was fateful for east_timor first the old colonial masters the portuguese withdrew then an internal struggle broke_out between the timorese democratic union on the one hand and the fretilin liberation movement on the other and the autumn ended with the indonesian invasion in the twenty one years that have passed since this conquest of a country and a people has never been internationally recognised ramos_horta was a fretilin leader one of the moderates whose ideal was social democracy during the so_called civil war he was out of the country and on his return in september he tried to reconcile the parties since the invasion he has lived abroad unceasingly and with great personal sacrifice collecting and communicating information on the repression torture and killing in his home country and acting as east timor's principal international spokesman at the same_time he has successfully kept up his efforts to unite the various east timorese groups in a single national front while constantly seeking opportunities for a peaceful_solution to the conflict with indonesia based_on respect for the integrity of the east timorese people we used to joke that he was more an informal member of the democratic union than a fretilin leader says union leader joao carrascalao the remark illustrates the part played by ramos_horta as a mediator and conciliator no serious negotiations aimed_at resolving the conflict are conceivable today without the participation of ramos_horta or one of his aides as bishop belo has also emphasised as a relatively unknown priest bishop belo was appointed apostolic administrator for the roman_catholic church in east_timor in 1983 since when he has served on his home ground again and again in the midst of everyday terror and suffering he has intervened trying to reconcile and mediate and lessen confrontation and in doing so he has saved many lives intervening in a violent conflict entails a risk of being crushed between the antagonists pray for me please he said in one such situation because now i have to defend myself on both_sides but bishop belo has become much more_than a mediator this man of peace has also become a rallying point for his sorely tried people a representative of their hope for a better future the love his people feel for this mediator springs from certain fundamental_principles he has adhered to show the people respect give them freedom to develop their humanity to the full then ask them whether they want to be indonesians portuguese or independent bishop belo shares with his people the insight of the oppressed an insight deeper than that of generals or oppressors why all this brutality it does_not even serve its purpose you do not gain respect if you do not show respect this year has seen the commemoration forty_years on of the soviet union's brutal crushing of the popular rising in hungary in 1956 the west did not intervene since hungary lay within the soviet sphere of interest it was necessary realpolitik to accept the invasion we would do well to recall that at that time a marking of the event forty_years later in a free hungary lay beyond the bounds of what most people thought possible it has been said that indonesia's annexation of east_timor is a historic fact but history has never established anything as a fact for ever history always moves on if we have learned anything in the past decade it must be that the most repressive regimes are the most fragile there are forces in history more powerful than the strongest military force violence and terror do not lead to peace not until one builds up the courage to break_out of the vicious_circle of violence do opportunities arise for an enduring peace the right to live the right to full development as human_beings the right to respect are at the heart of the concept of human_rights since the award of the nobel peace_prize for 1960 to albert_lutuli work for human_rights has been one of the principal criteria for the award we have constantly received confirmation that this was the right path to take although the choice of this criterion has also been criticised because it allegedly has nothing to do with peace but it is precisely in forging a close link between the human_rights criterion and peace that we believe we are realising that criterion's most universal and most fundamental aspects peace stability and harmony must be based_on mutual respect that so simple and so universal is the message once it has been heard the next step is to institutionalise the respect in various ways according to cultural traditions violence on the other_hand systematic violence on the part of those in power can never be justified within the framework of a universal concept of human_rights that is a fact to which the victims of violence could testify never forget to listen to the voice of the victims the voice of the nearly two hundred_thousand whose lives were lost in massacres or from the hunger and want which resulted from the indonesian invasion of east_timor this_year's two peace_prize laureates carlos filipe ximenes belo and jose ramos_horta have laboured tirelessly and with great personal sacrifice for their oppressed people under extremely difficult conditions they have preserved their humanity and faith in the future it is in admiration of their work and in the hope for a better future for east_timor that the norwegian_nobel committee today honours them with the nobel peace_prize for 1996 from les_prix nobel the nobel prizes 1996 editor tore frängsmyr nobel foundation stockholm 1997 translation of the norwegian_text your_majesties excellencies_ladies and gentlemen there are those among us who are unswerving in their faith that things can be done io make our world a better safer and more humane place and who also even when the tasks appear overwhelming have the courage to tackle them such people deserve our admiration and our gratitude we are delighted and honoured to welcome some of them to the oslo city hall today our warm welcome to you the representatives of the icbl the international campaign to ban landmines and to you jody williams the campaign's strongest single driving_force you have not only dared to tackle your task but also proved that the impossible is possible you have helped to rouse public_opinion all over the world against the use of an arms technology that strikes quite randomly at the most innocent and most defenceless and you have opened up the possibility that this wave of opinion can be channelled into political action we all know that the largest part of the task still lies ahead many nations among them the largest have been reluctant at least so far to commit_themselves to not using this weapon there is still the almost hopelessly huge and resource consuming task of destroying the landmines over one hundred million of them that have been deployed and the effort to build_up opportunities for dignified lives for the many millions of innocent mine victims has only just begun but through your self_sacrificing work you have won support and created an organization that lead us to believe that it will be possible to reach the goal a world completely free from anti personnel mines the course has been set and the inspiration given that is no small achievement but a first step of very great and perhaps decisive_importance that step is what we honour you for today the mobilisation and focussing of broad popular involvement which we have witnessed bears promise that goes beyond the present issue it appears to have established a pattern for how to realise political aims at the global level the icbl is an umbrella organization for over one thousand nongovernmental organizations large and small which have taken up the cause the norwegian_nobel committee_wishes to honour them all and to draw_attention to the impact which such broad coordination can achieve a second characteristic feature of this process that ought to be noted is how in the next instance the political level was mobilised a week ago in ottawa 121 countries signed the total ban on anti personnel mines through foreign_minister lloyd axworthy the government of canada took the deci sive initiative in that mobilisation when in october 1996 it invited all countries to the ottawa meeting such a treaty axworthy said in connection with the invitation can be a powerful force that establishes the moral norm that the production use stockpiling and transfer of anti personnel mines is to be banned forever the strategy adopted in other words was not to water the treaty down with a lot of exceptions aimed_at inducing the hesitant to join in but to convey a clear message though this may have frightened some countries off it has of course because of the overwhelming support for the process placed the larger nations under considerable political pressure the problem of landmines has been on the international agenda for a long time it was discussed in 1980 in connection with the landmine protocol to the conventional weapons convention it was when negotiations on the revision of that protocol were being held in 1995 96 that frustration at the lack of progress made itself felt in november 1991 the vietnam veterans of america foundation in washington d.c and medico international in frankfurt agreed to launch a campaign aimed_at banning anti personnel mines when the first international conference on landmines was held in london in may 1993 representatives of 40 voluntary organizations attended the following year in geneva 75 organizations were represented today over one thousand organizations are members of the icbl it was by hooking into this popular involvement that the ottawa process came to mark a new political beginning lifting the cause out of the backwater it had drifted into it is interesting to watch this initiative apparently feeding back into the united_nations and the whole system of international negotiations and giving them new life effective political action is dependent on cooperation at several levels at the national level that is old news first given memorable expression over 150 years_ago by de tocqueville in his famous analysis of democracy in america representative political bodies can not carry on politics in a vacuum they need in some way or other to be rooted in public_opinion and public_opinion must be formed and directed by the active involvement of individual members of society in society's manifold organizations or associations these are the fundamental institutional elements of what we have learned to know as a civil society the problem at the international level is that no global civil society has existed perhaps it is not so surprising that the un has not always been able to be as effective as we might have wished but in the extensive cooperation we have been registering between the multitude of nongovernmental organizations the many national governments and the international political system first and foremost the un we may be seeing the outline of what may turn into a global civil society we have glimpsed similar features in other connections but hardly as clearly as in this particular case in the bold hope this gives us for further development in the same direction we see promising signs of a more peaceful world how did landmines come to be the problem that generated this kind of international concern weapons exist that in many ways are more terrible and pose a greater threat nuclear_weapons in particular and is it not the case that by banning certain types of weapon one indirectly legitimises the use of others and thereby also legitimises war what sort of peace policy is it just to ban certain types of weapon certainly we have seen similar types of commitment directed against nuclear_weapons in particular and the norwegian_nobel committee has on a number of occasions most recently in 1995 called attention to active opposition to the build_up of nuclear_arms there is a vast difference between nuclear_weapons and landmines the former are the weapons of the rich the latter of the poor yet they also have something in common both hit victims at a vast remove from the actual warfare they strike mainly at civilian_populations and their effects continue for generations after the end of the armed conflict they are weapons which cast the shadow of war also across peace war's threat to life and limb is everywhere and never ending to set limits to war's repercussions for civilian_populations and its impact on times of peace has always been an important aim of genuine work for peace at this very time while nuclear war casts its shadow over us all and perhaps for that very reason has remained an unrealised threat since 1945 landmines are exploding every_single day nearly all those killed or maimed are the poorest and most defenceless among us and probably number some 26,000 each year yet the most alarming aspect of the situation may not be that total itself but the constant threat to the much larger numbers who live in the danger zones who do not know where they can send their children out to play or who can only gather fuel or work in the fields at great risk to their own lives such people have been robbed of the opportunity to use the land to build their own societies the icbl and jody williams work is work for disarmament the norwegian_nobel committee has frequently honoured disarmament efforts or work for the reduction of standing_armies to use nobel's own words disarmament reduces tension and thereby the threat of war the work of the icbl and jody williams is however primarily aimed_at what i have just mentioned sheltering civilian_populations from war it is a humanitarian project the norwegian_nobel committee's tradition of honouring humanitarian efforts goes right back to the first peace_prize awarded in 1901 to henri_dunant the founder of the red_cross humanitarian work prevents war by seeking to eliminate the underlying causes of violence and war the causes in the human mind a humanitarian effort aims at fraternity_between nations again to quote nobel it is a hand outstretched to the victims both those_who have been maimed and those in danger it is a demonstration of care and compassion that transcends all national_boundaries it is a paradox that what we find inside landmines is nobel's brilliant invention dynamite nobel was a profoundly moral man and was deeply concerned about the potential of dynamite in weapons technology at one time he developed a doctrine of deterrence he wrote to his close friend the peace activist bertha_von suttner that perhaps his factories were more effective in preventing war than her peace congresses he can not have been completely convinced however when he decided to establish a peace_prize the idea probably came from bertha_von suttner and it was not a fear ridden peace he wished to honour but a peace of reconciliation and brotherhood the inspiration from bertha_von suttner is reflected in the special mention given in his will to the organization of peace congresses as a criterion for the award bertha_von suttner was to become the first woman laureate when she was awarded the peace_prize herself in 1905 after nobel's death there have not been many women among the laureates and no_doubt there should have been more but let_us at least take credit for having made an early start with her self_sacrificing untiring and fruitful service to humanity and peace jody williams is a worthy successor to bertha_von suttner who inspired the peace_prize and brought nobel to the realisation that peace must be rooted in the human mind an important step has been taken the vast problem of landmines has effectively been placed on the international agenda the worldwide opinion has been formed that something must be done about the problem and the practical work of freeing the world from landmines has begun it is in admiration and in gratitude for their efforts to achieve that aim that we honour the icbl and jody williams today with the nobel peace_prize for 1997 the vast and laborious task of putting an end to the production and sale of mines destroying existing mines and helping the victims has however only just begun let_us therefore also express the hope that the process will win still greater support so that the work can be intensified and a world without antipersonnel mines can become a reality in the foreseeable future translation of the norwegian_text your_majesties excellencies_ladies and gentlemen on good_friday this year an agreement was signed which has rightly been seen as a breakthrough in the efforts to achieve a peaceful_solution to the long lasting conflict in northern_ireland in the referendum on 25 may the agreement won the support of a large majority of the people and in june elections were held to the northern_ireland assembly according to the principles laid_down in the agreement this autumn formerly irreconcilable enemies have attended the assembly together we all know that major problems still lie_ahead and that the new constitutional foundation for the peaceful resolution of conflicts is brittle this autumn too we have witnessed terrorist attacks in which several people have been killed but it does seem as if these have been isolated occurrences and that they have only served to strengthen the general demand for building on the foundations for peaceful solutions laid in the good_friday agreement the ira cease_fire an important condition for progress towards peace remains in force so although we are aware that things can change rapidly in our unsettled world the situation has been a different one since good_friday of this year the vicious_circle of violence has been broken the peace process has built up a momentum of its own which makes a return to earlier conditions of terror unlikely although we must be prepared for minor setbacks as the process continues the norwegian_nobel committee has chosen two men who in its opinion should be specially honoured for their contributions to the peace process john hume and david trimble it is with great pleasure that we welcome you to our cold but peaceful north to receive the nobel peace_prize for 1998 you are foremost among the many who have placed themselves at the service of peace in and outside northern_ireland john hume and david trimble are both from northern_ireland where they have lived with and in the conflict they are both prominent politicians leaders respectively of the two largest political parties in northern_ireland parties which represent the two groups in a divided population they have both committed themselves to the course which the good_friday agreement represents that conflicts must be solved by peaceful_means the strong support for the agreement in the referendum shows that they made the right choice political leadership is not to trim your sail to every wind it is to initiate movement and to act at the right time like other political leaders the two laureates have both helped to build confidence that it is possible to arrive_at reasonable compromises by peaceful_means as political leaders they are guarantors to their constituents that peaceful methods will lead to solutions which both_sides can live with and live better than if a state of war had continued in a tense situation such exposed positions require large amounts of both wisdom and courage today's laureates have shown both but there are differences between them in 1970 at a time of spiralling violence john hume played a part in the foundation of the party of which he became the unquestioned leader the social democratic and labour party sdlp it is a nationalist party but it has stood firmly throughout for the principle that only peaceful_means must be used more_than anyone_else hume is the architect behind the peace process and the solution chosen in the good_friday agreement he has held unwaveringly to the line that discussions and institutional solutions have to be inclusive even those_who had chosen violent means in their political struggle had to be given opportunities to participate in the peace process to change their strategy and to be taken at their word when they did so especially during periods of escalating violence hume has had to swallow sometimes very harsh criticism from within his own ranks as well as from others for his gentle approach to the hard liners but with his personal integrity hume has stood firm and his policy has won through the northern irish nobel laureate in literature seamus heaney used the fable of the hedgehog and the fox to describe our two laureates and the difference between them john hume is the hedgehog who knew the big truth that justice had to prevail he wrote david trimble on the other_hand is the fox who has known many things but who had the intellectual clarity and political courage to know that 1998 was the time to move unionism towards an accommodation with reasonable and honourable nationalist aspirations in so doing he opened the possibility of a desirable and credible future for all the citizens of northern_ireland when he was elected leader of northern ireland's traditionally largest party the ulster unionist party uup trimble was a relative newcomer to top level politics he was known as an uncompromising unionist but soon showed that he had other political sides to him and clearly felt that the situation demanded more flexible attitudes on the part of the unionists under his leadership enough fear and suspicion was overcome to enable a majority of unionists to rally behind the good_friday agreement i need hardly add that trimble too has come in for strong criticism for his conciliatory approach only those_who have themselves experienced having their rights trampled on who have seen their loved ones killed who have had to live with loss fear and suspicion only they can fully grasp what it means to live under such conditions or wholly understand the reactions such a situation provokes in her book a strategy for peace the philosopher sissela bok daughter of peace_prize laureate alva_myrdal writes about what she calls the pathology of partisanship about how war can create in us a mental state which leaves us devoid of respect even of pity for even the most innocent victims she recalls the writer stephen spender's horror at finding that pathological condition in himself in the spanish civil war only through strong leadership and institutional guarantees can a society withstand such destructiveness sissela bok concludes we who are looking on from the outside must be humble and slow to judge judging is not our business but the conflict does also involve us it tells_us something about ourselves by bringing general human features to light the pathology of partisanship is one such feature it tells_us something about why violence engenders violence it is remarkable and promising that despite such a cycle despite the extremes in northern_ireland we are seeing more and more individuals standing up and proclaiming that forgiveness and reconciliation are more important than retaliation looking about us in the world we see that people seeking peace following a violent past generally seem to find that the cry for justice must be subordinated to the call for reconciliation and amnesty that is what we have learned for instance from south_africa and who after all are the just in a situation like the one in northern_ireland with two clashing views of reality meanwhile we also learn with sissela bok how important strong leadership and institutional guarantees are in building up that desire for reconciliation which can move us away from a state of violence our laureates stand for such leadership i have already_mentioned that they have both been criticised for their moderate and inclusive approach there has been so much fear and suspicion that for many it has become difficult to believe in the other party's good intentions the adoption of an inclusive strategy implies a deliberate break with suspicion a disregard for fear that precisely is the strategy of reconciliation no_doubt there are situations in which it is naive to believe in the other party's good faith to do so may be risky but a real peace process needs people who are willing to take that risk we need the bold or if you will the credulous people who are willing to stretch out a hand it is surprising to see what a disarming effect innocence can sometimes have on the other party in addition to leadership we need institutional guarantees again according to sissela bok the good_friday agreement provides institutional guarantees it neither represents nor was intended to represent any agreement at the substantive level unionists are still unionists and nationalists are still nationalists what they have acquired are institutions for the peaceful resolution of conflicts permit_me a brief parallel with our own experience in 1814 norway was forced into a union with sweden war_broke out on norwegian soil between the norwegian peasant army and the professional swedish army which had returned from the continent after helping to defeat napoleon the fighting in norway was brought to an end when the great_powers intervened they decided great_britain among them that norway must enter the union but norway was allowed to retain her new constitutional system armaments were replaced by political institutions to reverse clausewitz's famous aphorism politics became the continuation of war by other means ninety one years later the union was peacefully dissolved the peaceful relation between the two parties was given symbolic expression when the swede nobel made the norwegians responsible for awarding the peace_prize in 1977 the norwegian_nobel committee awarded the peace_prize for 1976 to mairead_corrigan and betty_williams northern ireland's peace people it has since been said that the time was not ripe this time too we have heard that our choice may be premature that lasting peace is still far to seek the argument is easy to understand and nothing could have pleased us more_than to have been able to say today that peace was certain but in connection with these awards as with a number of others the committee bore in mind nobel's clear intention that the prize should reflect current affairs and that it should advance the cause of peace we know that a peace process may be long and difficult and suffer frequent reverses in such processes it is important to focus on the advances made perhaps against the odds and on the persons brave enough to stand up in a good cause reverses do not mean that their efforts have been in vain they may have laid the foundations for renewed efforts at the next opportunity that is how peace is built slowly like drilling through hard wood as max weber put it the work along the way is just as important as the finishing touch and it is by drawing attention to the present stage that one may perhaps contribute to further progress our two laureates have done great work in the cause of good they have both shown great courage so have many others gerry adams bertie ahern tony blair and bill clinton to name just a few of those_who contributed most in the final stages of the process leading to the good_friday agreement united_states senator george mitchell who made such a significant contribution as a mediator gave an accurate description of the work of our two laureates which i shall take the liberty of quoting without mr hume there would have been no peace process without mr trimble no agreement it is a privilege for us to be able to honour you here_today at the same_time we know there are many difficult tasks ahead we take comfort from the fact that you will still be heading the process and that you enjoy good strong support from many sides translation of the norwegian_text your_majesties your_royal highness excellencies_ladies and gentlemen few aims can be more praiseworthy than to combat suffering to help those in the most desperate situations whatever their race and wherever they may be to return to a dignified life some persons even have the necessary strength and drive to live up to this ideal we welcome a few of them today we do so humbly recognising that they are representatives of a much greater number of self_sacrificing men and women all over the world our thoughts go not least to those_who at this very moment are working under the most difficult conditions often putting their own lives at risk in scenes of the profoundest suffering and degradation every year médecins_sans frontières send out over 2,500 doctors nurses and other professional helpers to more_than 80 countries where they co operate with a good 15,000 local personnel they go where need suffering and hopelessness are greatest indeed often catastrophic in nature regardless of whether the catastrophes are human or natural in origin we find them in the world's countless refugee camps as well as among chinese peasants russian prisoners or the western world's modern city slum dwellers they are present in large numbers in africa the forgotten continent the modest beginnings of médecins_sans frontières go back to the early 1970s and a small group of french doctors formed under the leadership of bernard kouchner what triggered them was their experience of emergency aid work in two disasters one natural the great flood in east pakistan later bangladesh and one man made the cruel conflict in biafra from 1967 to 1970 some of the doctors who provided emergency aid in those disaster areas were frustrated at finding their work impeded by complicated procedures and principles of neutrality the new organisation would have to be unbureaucratic flexible and willing to take risks médecins_sans frontières blazed new trails in international humanitarian work the organisation reserved the right to intervene to help people in need irrespective of prior political approval the essential points for médecins_sans frontières are to reach those in need of help as quickly as possible and to maintain impartiality they demand freedom to carry_out their medical mandate and to decide for themselves whom to help according to purely humanitarian criteria what is more they insist on making human_rights violations known in addition to helping in other words they also seek to draw_attention to the causes of humanitarian catastrophes to alleviate distress one must also get to its roots these were new principles in the field of aid and have not been uncontroversial some said that this was to confuse the issues in ways which might block access to suffering people médecins_sans frontières have been called emergency aid rebels the first nobel prizes were awarded in 1901 nearly a hundred years_ago at the beginning of the century which will draw to a close in less_than a month's time the first peace_prize went to henri_dunant founder of the red_cross who shared it with the peace activist frédéric passy dunant was goaded into action by happening to be an eye witness to the incredible carnage at the battle of solferino in northern italy in 1859 the award to dunant came in for criticism humanitarian work was not relevant to peace ran the argument but simply humanised war there were however grounds for the decision in nobel's will which mentions fraternity_between nations as one of the criteria for the peace_prize what better or more direct expression can there be of this idea of fraternity than to hold out a helping_hand to a sufferer regardless of identity or party the peace alfred_nobel was thinking of when he established the prize was a peace that is rooted in men's hearts and minds by showing each victim a human face by showing respect for his or her human_dignity the fearless and selfless aid worker creates hope for peace and reconciliation that brings us to the heart of the matter to absolutely fundamental prerequisites for peace the decision to award the first peace_prize to humanitarian work was one of the most_important decisions in the history of the prize that we are continuing at the end of the century and the millennium to recognise humanitarian work confirms that the course plotted then was the right one but in the meantime the world has changed we are constantly having to face new challenges the historian eric hobsbawm has labelled the century which is now ending the age of extremes what he has in mind is this century's totalitarian regimes we have witnessed man made catastrophes that spread far_beyond the battlefields systematic violations of human_rights ethnic cleansing and genocide we have been forced to acknowledge the close connection between war or the threat of war and those systematic breaches of human_rights the threat to peace to real peace was more extensive than the peace campaigners had imagined at the beginning of the century this way of thinking began making itself felt in international work after the second_world war but only slowly measures against violations of human_rights necessarily present challenges to the established principle of non intervention this principle has for a long time been regarded as fundamental to peace work and is still current although today it is being confronted ever more strongly by demands for intervention against breaches of human_rights the norwegian_nobel committee made its first purely human_rights award in 1960 to albert_lutuli of south_africa since then this has been a major criterion for peace_prize awards as can be seen from the awards to martin_luther king andrei_sakharov lech_walesa aung_san suu_kyi and carlos belo among many others those awards too were criticised for not being relevant to peace many of them gave rise to disputes and protests principally from the laureates home countries as amounting to intervention in internal affairs a characteristic feature of médecins_sans frontières is that more clearly than anyone_else they combine in their work the two criteria we have mentioned humanitarian work and work for human_rights they achieve this by insisting on their right to arouse public_opinion and to point to the causes of the man made catastrophes namely systematic breaches of the most fundamental rights the award to médecins_sans frontières is first and foremost a humanitarian award maintaining the tradition that goes back to the first award but it is also a human_rights award and as such it links up with more recent developments in the history of the peace_prize like the nobel_committee's human_rights awards the exposures by médecins_sans frontières of violations of human_rights began during the cold_war when they were chiefly aimed_at the brutality of communist regimes since the end of the cold_war the need for humanitarian intervention has certainly not diminished meanwhile however the situations have grown more complex more chaotic war has turned into something other and much less clearly definable than a struggle between the armed_forces of identifiable nations military units have been dissolved into armed bands it is often difficult to name those responsible or to find anyone to negotiate with and the victims of these wars are not first and foremost the soldiers as at solferino but the civilian_populations the women and the children the changed nature of war requires reassessments of strategies for peace humanitarian interventions with or without peace keeping or other forces are figuring ever more prominently in such strategies today humanitarian interventions have also become important features of the foreign policies of many states in this connection voluntary organizations ngos are finding ever more important parts to play but the politicization of aid work with voluntary organizations integrating ever more closely with governments is creating new problems situations may easily arise in which motives are unclear and the allocation of functions can be questioned on the other_hand we hear talk of the humanitarian trap how can you help the victims without at the same_time helping their executioners there have been cases of military groups imposing starvation on a region and then stealing the aid when it arrives there are brutal regimes which deliberately exploit the aid organizations knowledge that someone will care for them swells the flood of refugees which can contribute to ethnic cleansing for these reasons médecins_sans frontières have on one or two occasions withdrawn from involvement the genocide in rwanda in 1994 led to a huge influx of refugees into the neighbouring state of zaire médecins_sans frontières were on the spot throughout but for a time the organization withdrew from the refugee camps in zaire in protest_against the abuse of aid and the terrorising of refugees by extremists médecins_sans frontières followed their protest up with an appeal to world opinion that was also the first occasion on which the organization called for military intervention to put a stop to brutality médecins_sans frontières are generally highly critical of humanitarian intervention by military force they believe experience has shown them how a humanitarian military alliance can introduce the logic of war and break down the humanitarian aspect of a mission in some cases it also increases the risk to the humanitarian aid workers themselves as happened in iraq somalia and bosnia médecins_sans frontières do not want military protection and all their vehicles are clearly marked with a symbol showing that they are unarmed a submachine gun with a heavy cross painted over it henri_dunant imagined that there was a neutral zone which lay outside the spheres of interest of the warring parties and which one could therefore enter with humanitarian aid today we see such humanitarian zones invaded by both_sides obliging aid organizations to make political choices and take positions on complicated moral issues it is precisely in such situations that it becomes especially necessary to preserve one's independence médecins_sans frontières are among the organisations which attach the greatest importance to independence insisting among other_things that half their revenues must come from private donors a large number of aid organisations are extensively and selflessly engaged in alleviating suffering all over the world they all deserve our gratitude and our attention médecins_sans frontières have a distinctive profile and have managed to preserve many of their original virtues they are frequently the first to arrive_at the scene of a disaster the organisation remains pervaded by idealism and willingness to take great risks it has kept its independence and seeks systematically to draw_attention to violations and distress equally important is the fact that médecins_sans frontières have indicated more clearly than any other organisation how burdened aid work is in our chaotic world with political and moral dilemmas the organization has tried in various ways to adapt to this and has sometimes through provocative initiatives set in motion an absolutely essential discussion of the problematic nature of humanitarian interventions not only in their aims but also and chiefly in their consequences good_deeds are important but they should also lead to good results here as so often in life a balance has to be found between an ethics of conviction and an ethics of responsibility through their strategy and their initiatives médecins_sans frontières have unquestionably influenced the whole development of international aid work let_us in conclusion remind ourselves that however chaotic a situation may be or however difficult the choices one faces one consideration remains paramount that is to reduce distress and alleviate suffering médecins_sans frontières provide professional assistance efficiently to people who are suffering or in need the organisation stands for an open helping_hand extended across borders through conflicts and into political chaos it is by never compromising over this paramount mandate that one can achieve outward legitimacy and inner inspiration this self_sacrificing commitment kindles in us all the belief that the next century may be better and more peaceful than this century's age of extremism it is this self_sacrificing effort which we honour here_today translation of the norwegian_text your_majesty your_royal highnesses excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has decided to award the nobel peace_prize for the year 2000 to kim_dae jung he receives the prize for his lifelong work for democracy and human_rights in south_korea and east asia in general and for peace and reconciliation with north_korea in particular we welcome the laureate here_today the question has been raised of whether it is too early to award the prize for a process of reconciliation which has only just begun it would suffice to say in reply that kim_dae jung's work for human_rights made him a worthy candidate irrespective of the recent developments in relations_between the two korean states it is also clear however that his strong commitment to reconciliation with north_korea and the results that have been achieved especially in the past year added a new and important dimension to kim_dae jung's candidacy while recognising that reverses in international peace work are something one has to be prepared for the nobel_committee nevertheless adheres to the principle nothing ventured nothing gained the peace_prize is a reward for the steps that have been taken so far however as so often before in the history of the nobel peace_prize it is intended this year too as an encouragement to advance still further along the long road to peace and reconciliation this is to a large_extent a matter of courage kim_dae jung has had the will to break with fifty_years of ingrained hostility and to reach out a cooperative hand across what has probably been the world's most heavily guarded frontier his has been the kind of personal and political courage which regrettably is all too often missing in other conflict ridden regions the same applies to peace work as to life in general when you set out to cross the highest mountains the first steps are the hardest but you can count on plenty of company along the glamorous finishing stretch gunnar roaldkvam a writer from stavanger puts this so simply and so aptly in his poem the last drop once upon a time there were two drops of water one was the first the other the last the first drop was the bravest i could quite fancy being the last drop the one that makes everything run over so that we get our freedom back but who wants to be the first drop today kim_dae jung is the president of a democratic south_korea his path to power has been long extremely long for decades he fought a seemingly hopeless fight_against an authoritarian regime one may well ask where he found the strength his own answer is i used all my strength to resist the dictatorial regimes because there was no other way to defend the people and promote democracy i felt like a homeowner whose house was invaded by a robber i had to fight the intruder with my bare hands to protect my family and property without thinking of my own safety in the 1950s when kim ran for election to the national assembly the police were used to prevent support for any other candidates than the regime's own he was not elected until 1961 but that success was short lived a military coup three days later led to the dissolution of the assembly but kim did not give up in 1963 after ten_years of almost continuous political struggle he finally took a seat in the national assembly as an opposition representative the ruling party it should be added tried to buy him kim was not for sale in 1971 kim_dae jung ran in the presidential election winning 46 per_cent of the votes despite considerable ballot rigging this made him a serious threat to the military regime as a result he spent many long years first in prison then in house arrest and in exile in japan and the united_states he also underwent kidnapping and assassination attempts somehow enduring all these trials kim kept up his outspoken opposition to the regime as a member of a delegation from the norwegian_storting i visited south_korea in 1979 a visit which among other_things brought me into contact_with supporters of kim_dae jung i_am glad i was able then to serve as a link to important connections in scandinavia even under severe prison conditions kim_dae jung managed to find things to live for with indomitable optimism he wrote about the pleasures he found in prison reading all kinds of eastern and western books theology politics economics history and literature the brief meetings with his family the letters from those closest to him and the opportunities to write back despite all the attempts to prevent him and finally the flowers in the tiny patch of a garden where he was allowed to spend an hour a day kim_dae jung's story has a lot in common with the experience of several other peace_prize laureates especially nelson_mandela and andrei_sakharov and with that of mahatma_gandhi who did not receive the prize but would have deserved it to outsiders kim's invincible spirit may appear almost superhuman on this point too the laureate takes a more sober view many people tell me he says that i_am courageous because i have been to prison six or seven times and overcome several close calls in my life however the truth is that i_am as timid now as i was in my boyhood considering what i have experienced in my life i should not be afraid of being imprisoned but whenever i was locked up i was invariably fearful and anxious self knowledge of this order does_not detract from the courage kim_dae jung ran in two more presidential elections in 1987 and 1992 if no military regime stood in his way the argument was used against him in a country of sharp regional divisions that he came from the wrong region finally wearying of the struggle he withdrew from active politics after the 1992 election but in 1997 kim_dae jung saw a new opportunity incredibly enough with his political enemies divided amongst themselves the military regime's leading opponent was elected_president that was the definitive proof that south_korea had at long last found a place among the world's democracies the idea of revenge must have occurred to the new president instead as with nelson_mandela forgiveness and reconciliation became the main planks in kim's political platform and guided the steps he took kim_dae jung forgave most things including the unforgivable what had taken_place was a democratic revolution but even after a revolution some features of the old order live on in a democratic perspective south_korea still has some way to go where reform of the legal system and of security legislation is concerned according to amnesty_international there are still long_term political prisoners in south korean gaols others maintain that the rights of organized labour are not sufficiently safeguarded our reply is that we feel confident that kim_dae jung will complete the process of democratisation of which he has been the foremost spokesman for almost half a century an important debate is currently being conducted in asia concerning the status of human_rights it is argued by some that such rights are a western invention a tool for achieving western political and cultural dominance kim rejects this view just as he also denies that there are any special asian as distinct from universal human_rights the same way of thinking led the nobel_committee in its grounds for this_year's award to draw particular attention to the important part kim has played in the development of human_rights throughout east asia as josé ramos_horta peace_prize laureate in 1996 and with us here_today has stated kim also vigorously took up the cause of east_timor there was great symbolic force in the decision to place the south korean army used only a few years previously to suppress political opposition in its own_country at the disposal of the global community in defence of human_rights in east_timor kim_dae jung has also actively supported aung_san suu_kyi peace_prize laureate in 1991 in her heroic struggle_against the dictatorship in burma our thoughts today also reach out to her prevented as she has so far been from coming to norway to receive the peace_prize she so richly deserves unfortunately the regime is once_again stepping up its pressure on aung_san suu_kyi kim was elected_president on a program of extensive reforms in south_korea and an active policy of cooperation with north_korea now widely spoken of as the sunshine policy the term originated in aesop's fable about the traveller who in a strong north wind drew his cloak ever more closely about him only to have to take it off in the end because of the warmth of the sun the sunshine policy is designed if not to stop the wind then at least to lessen the cold through gradually increasing interaction and an emphasis on the common interests of the two states kim_dae jung has made it clear that south_korea has no intention of annexing or absorbing its northern neighbour the target is reunification although both parties know that it will take time and will require the most thorough preparation there can be little doubt that to date kim_dae jung has been the prime mover behind the ongoing process of détente and reconciliation perhaps his role can best be compared with willy_brandt s whose ostpolitik was of such fundamental importance in the normalisation between the two german states and won him the peace_prize brandt's ostpolitik alone could not have led to german unification but it was a prerequisite for the union which followed in 1989 90 from south korea's point of view the political side of germany's unification looks attractive while the economic side with a price tag that may be much higher in korea than in germany is a warning to make haste slowly the dialogue between kim_dae jung and kim jung ii at the pyongyang summit last june led to more_than loose declarations and airy rhetoric the pictures of family members meeting after five decades of separation made a deep impression all over the world however restricted and controlled these contacts may be the tears of joy are a stark contrast to the cold hatred and discouragement felt so strongly by all visitors to the border at panmunjon the people of north_korea have lived under extremely difficult conditions for a long time the international community can not be indifferent to their hunger or remain silent in the face of the country's massive political repression on the other_hand north korea's leaders deserve recognition for their part in the first steps towards reconciliation between the two countries in most of the world the cold_war ice age is over the world may see the sunshine policy thawing the last remnants of the cold_war on the korean peninsula it may take time but the process has begun and no one has contributed more_than today's laureate kim_dae jung in the poet's words the first drop was the bravest translation of the norwegian_text your_majesty your_royal highnesses excellencies_ladies and gentlemen and not least this_year's and past year's peace_prize laureates let_me begin by extending a warm welcome to this_year's special peace_prize award_ceremony the nobel peace_prize for 2001 is awarded to the united_nations the un and its secretary_general kofi_annan for their work for a better_organized and more peaceful world this year we are celebrating the centenary of the nobel prizes including the peace_prize that makes it natural to consider historical continuities where both the better_organized world and the nobel peace_prize are concerned the idea that mankind has common interests and that this should find expression in some form or other of shared government or rules can be traced back to the roman empire in the twentieth century woodrow_wilson was a vigorous early spokesman for the belief that we people need each_other such a belief means that whether as states or as individuals we should treat one another in ways that do not make us less able to live together tolerance justice and humanity are essential to the unity of mankind alfred_nobel had no self_evident place in this tradition at one time he believed that dynamite his great invention could do more to prevent war than any peace movement nevertheless the will he made in 1895 was inspired by belief in the community of man the peace_prize was to be awarded to the person who had done most for fraternity_between nations for the abolition_or reduction of standing_armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses over the one hundred years that have passed since the first peace_prize was awarded in 1901 the foremost sustained intention of the norwegian_nobel committee has been precisely that of strengthening international co_operation between states in the period before world war i the majority of the peace prizes went to representatives of the organized peace movement either at the parliamentary level through the inter parliamentary union or at the more popular level through the international peace bureau but the prizes do not seem to have helped much the first world war_broke out in 1914 in the words of woodrow_wilson the first world war was to be the war to end wars and should make the world safe for democracy the new league of nations was to be the body that resolved conflicts before they led to war once_again the norwegian_nobel committee sought to promote this greater commitment in international co_operation in the years between the wars at least eight peace_prize laureates had clear connections with the league of nations although the league as such never in fact received the prize again the world and not least wilson himself was to be disappointed the 1919 peace_prize laureate was unable to persuade his own united_states to join the league of nations for would not binding obligations to an international organization also limit american sovereignty practically all of us wish to avoid the horrors of war but we have different notions about how this can come about all non pacifists seek other_things in addition to peace there is not necessarily anything wrong with that nor can peace be absolute that was why so many took up arms against hitler germany and the emperor's japan the horrors of world war ii made the hopes people pinned on the new world organization the united_nations all the greater the new organization was set even higher targets than the league of nations the preamble to the un charter thus speaks of we the peoples of the united_nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind there were many points of organizational similarity between the league of nations and the un but the league of nations had failed the answer was to give the security_council a much more prominent role than the corresponding council had had in the league of nations universal membership would be combined with special rights exercised by the great_powers the security_council could use military force to maintain peace it was even to have standing armed_forces at its disposal to be established by member states in cooperation we have not reached that goal even today fifty six years on the un has achieved many successes not least in the humanitarian and social fields where its various special organizations have done such important work in some respects the un achieved more_than its founders believed possible it found itself in the thick of the process of decolonization which in a few short decades swept away centuries old colonial empires the un set important standards which influenced developments for the majority of people all over the world the universal_declaration of human_rights adopted by the un in 1948 became one of the major documents of our time article 1 gives clear expression to the hope for a better_organized and more peaceful world all human_beings are born free and equal in dignity and human_rights they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood the norwegian_nobel committee has sought to give these successes the credit they deserve since 1945 at least 13 of the peace prizes have had links to the un some have gone to un organizations such as the high_commissioner for refugees winner of two awards unicef the ilo or the un's peace keeping forces others have gone to individuals like cordell_hull reputed to have provided the inspiration underlying the un john_boyd orr the first head of the fao ralph_bunche first of many un mediators in the middle_east and in 1950 the first non white peace_prize laureate dag_hammarskjöld the un's second secretary_general or rené cassin main author of the declaration of human_rights in its most_important area however preventing war and ensuring peace the un did not turn out to be all that its supporters had hoped for in many serious conflicts the organization remained on the sidelines or was used as a tool by one of the parties the five great_powers had all agreed that they had to have a veto but it is not the veto itself of course that explains the un's inability to act but rather the fact that the interests of the two super powers diverged so radically throughout the many years of cold_war seeing that the main theme in the history of the peace_prize has been the wish for a better_organized and more peaceful world it is surprising that the un as such has not been awarded the peace_prize before one reason may be disappointment that the un did not quite live up to all the expectations of 1945 another may be the many un related prizes which made it less necessary to give the award to the organization itself a good deal can be attributed to chance the un could have won the award so often that in the end it never did until a suitably important occasion arrived in connection with this_year's centenary the committee once_again felt a need to emphasise the continuous theme of the history of the peace_prize the hope for a better_organized and more peaceful world nothing symbolises that hope or represents that reality better than the united_nations the end of the cold_war meant that the un became able to play more of the role in security policy for which it was originally intended the great_powers still had diverging interests so too of course had the smaller states but they had less impact on the international climate although the usa provides the clearest illustration all countries are more or less selective in their attitudes to the un they favour an active un when they need and see opportunities to obtain its support but when the un takes a different stance they seek to limit its influence since the cold_war however greater and smaller powers have to a significant extent been able to unite in meeting the most serious common challenges to prevent wars and conflicts to stimulate economic development especially in poor countries to strengthen fundamental human_rights to promote a better environment to fight epidemics and in the most recent common endeavour to prevent international terrorism no one has done more_than kofi_annan to revitalise the un after taking office as the un's seventh secretary_general in january 1997 he managed in a very short time to give the un an external prestige and an internal morale the likes of which the organization had hardly seen in its over fifty year history with the possible exception of its very first optimistic years his position within the organization has no_doubt benefited from his having devoted almost all his working life to the un experience in a bureaucracy is not always the best springboard for action and fresh approaches to the outside world but annan has brought about both the un structure has been tightened up and made more efficient the secretary_general has figured prominently in the efforts to resolve a whole series of international disputes the repercussions of the gulf war the wars in the former yugoslavia and especially in kosovo the status of east_timor the war in the congo and the implementation of the un resolutions concerning the middle_east and land for peace on the basis of renewed emphasis on the declaration of human_rights annan has given the secretary_general a more active_part to play as a protector of those rights time and again he has maintained that sovereignty is not a shield behind which member countries can hide their violations he has shown the same activist approach to the struggle_against hiv aids a struggle which he has called his personal priority since the terrorist attack on new_york and washington on the 11th of september he has urged that the un must be given a leading part to play in the fight_against international terrorism the secretary general's report on the role of the un in the 21st century formed the basis for the un's millennium declaration here too the agenda is ambitious to put an end to poverty to provide better education for the world's billions of people to reduce hiv aids to protect the environment and to prevent war and armed conflict the only one of the un's previous six secretaries general who can be compared to annan in personal force and historical importance is dag_hammarskjöld the organization's second secretary_general and the recipient of the nobel peace_prize in 1961 for kofi_annan dag_hammarskjöld has been a model in his hammarskjöld memorial lecture in september this year annan said there can be no better rule of thumb for a secretary_general as he approaches each new challenge or crisis than to ask himself how would hammarskjöld have handled this annan is nevertheless more of a team player than hammarskjöld was in other respects too annan goes further than hammarskjöld could i suspect he would envy me the discretion i enjoy in deciding what to say and what topics to comment on this can occasionally be a bit much however even for annan i find myself called on to make official statements on almost everything that happens in the world today from royal marriages to the possibility of human cloning wars between states have grown quite rare in recent decades this can be regarded as a victory for norms which the un has stood for throughout its existence but many wars are still fought in our time the new development is that wars within states civil wars have become relatively more frequent this is confronting the un with major challenges the un has traditionally been a defender of the sovereignty of individual states the principle of state sovereignty is laid_down in the un charter especially in article 2.7 but even that article contains a qualification this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under chapter vii the chapter on action to preserve peace now that we are attaching ever increasing importance to human security and not just to the security of states it makes little difference whether a life is lost in an international or a civil war if the un is to prevent civil war the question soon arises of intervention from outside many see intervention as equivalent to invasion small states are naturally afraid that big states will use it as a pretext for interfering in their domestic affairs the policies of colonial powers in africa and asia the soviet union's entries into eastern_europe and the usa's various interventions in the western hemisphere all illustrate the need to protect the sovereignty of small states on the other_hand the present situation with civil wars in numerous countries is a high price to pay for regarding state sovereignty as absolute the massacres in rwanda taught_us all and not least annan that the world does_not necessarily get any better if one refrains from intervening as annan himself has said we applaud the policeman who intervenes to stop a fight or the teacher who tries to prevent bullying and fighting and a doctor intervenes to save patients lives a doctor who never intervenes has few admirers and probably even fewer patients where humanitarian concerns are uppermost doctors without borders msf in particular the 1999 laureate has argued that the global community has a duty to intervene a principle which the un general_assembly has accepted in several important resolutions the debate on humanitarian intervention raises difficult questions to which there are no pat answers especially when the debate shifts from purely humanitarian to more political ground under annan's leadership the un has shown itself willing to participate in this difficult discussion with significant results in the last few years developments have taken a favourable turn in kosovo though there is still a long way to go the un played a leading part in the process which in a short space of time advanced east_timor from the status of a colony to before long that of an independent state maybe the 1996 peace_prize awarded to belo and ramos_horta also contributed today large and small states alike are almost competing in urging the un to take the lead in developing afghanistan away from a taliban regime that has been a leading supporter of international terrorism and towards a broadly based government that can lead the country back into the international community so we have already moved well into the discussion of what steps to take to achieve a better_organized and more peaceful world in the next hundred years it has been repeated again and again that the un can not become anything more_than the world's ever so multifarious governments wish to make it but in the light of the many common tasks that lie_ahead we must at least see to it that the very slowest movers among the nations are not allowed to set too much of the future pace as globalisation expands the question will be asked even more loudly than at present of who is to manage this development and by what means in the view of the nobel_committee that will be a task for the un if not in the form of a centralised world government then at least as the more efficient global instrument which the world so sorely needs for that to come about it will help if nations as far as possible have a shared platform democracy is stronger today than at any time in history over half of the world's population lives under democratic government this marks a great victory for the principles in the human_rights declaration one need go no further than back to the inter war years when democracy was a threatened species of government to realise how dramatic this progress has been democracies rarely if ever go to war with each_other the strong position of democracy today gives grounds for optimism but much remains to be done not least in the economic field we have made very few advances in solidarity between countries that are growing ever richer and the many countries and individuals who either are not benefiting to the same extent from globalisation or are even suffering from its economic and social consequences the number of poor people in the world is ever increasing there were many reverses in the twentieth century for the world as a whole and for the idea of a better_organized and more peaceful world two world wars and a cold_war that lasted more_than forty_years and spread into every corner of the world set a limit to how optimistic we can feel about the future on the other_hand we have witnessed a remarkable development from the scattered and rather private peace initiatives at the previous turn of the century to the ever stronger and more efficient united_nations we have today the norwegian_nobel committee_wishes both to honour the work that the un and its secretary_general kofi_annan have already done and to encourage them to go ahead along the road to a still more forceful and dynamic united_nations translation of the norwegian_text your_majesties excellencies_ladies and gentlemen and not least this_year's laureate jimmy_carter in one of his volumes the norwegian_poet kolbein falkeid writes do not hang splendid moments up on the walls in your thoughts and gild them with your longing drive your crowbar hard under scarred working days and force them up one by one that is why life has you on its muster roll this_year's laureate jimmy_carter is most decidedly on life's muster roll he is one of the most deserving and least controversial laureates for a long time to quote from the nobel_committee's reasons for awarding carter this_year's peace_prize the norwegian_nobel committee has decided to award the nobel peace_prize for 2002 to jimmy_carter for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts to advance democracy and human_rights and to promote economic and social development that long sentence reflects the fact that this_year's laureate has contributed in practically all the areas that have figured most prominently through the one hundred and one years of peace_prize history he was the politician who during his presidency attempted to bring_about a more peaceful world he was and continues to be the mediator who seeks peaceful solutions to international conflicts he was and is engaged in disarmament and arms_control he has shown and still shows an outstanding commitment to democracy and human_rights his humanitarian and social activities have been and are still far_reaching not all his efforts have been equally successful but as carter himself has said and taken as his motto the worst thing that you can do is not to try few people if any have tried harder this_year's laureate does the opposite of what his countryman mark twain once wrote about forgetting where you bury the peace pipe but not where the battle axe is carter never mislays the peace pipe the nobel_committee has not very often honoured mediators it is the parties to a conflict that attract attention that was the case at camp_david in september 1978 but a mediator has rarely played a more important part than on precisely that occasion through thirteen days and as many nights carter showed that a mediator could make a decisive contribution to the creation of peace between egypt and israel but carter had broader aims than peace between those two countries he wanted peace in the whole middle_east he was the first american president to favour giving the palestinians their own homeland he emphasised that the israelis had to stop building new settlements on the west bank if only the parties had listened to both pieces of advice jimmy_carter should of course have been awarded the peace_prize a long time ago it is no secret today that the norwegian_nobel committee wished to give him the prize in 1978 together with anwar sadat and menachim begin a mere formality prevented carter from receiving his well earned peace_prize at that time he had not been nominated by the 1 february deadline and no member of the committee nominated him at the committee's first meeting they could of course not have known in february what was to happen at camp_david in september in september the committee wanted to add carter's name to the list but the statutes of the nobel foundation made that impossible so carter seemed to have missed his chance the committee could not go on to award also the following year's peace_prize to the efforts to achieve a peace agreement between egypt and israel no one could have blamed carter if he had felt that this was unfair every year since then there have been speculations about when carter would receive the peace_prize and every year he has been obliged to comment on awards given to others this he has always done with the same generosity though once in a very mild outburst he did say i'd be delighted not to mention surprised if just once before i die nobody would suggest that what i'm really trying to do with these years my hidden agenda is to win the nobel peace_prize it became increasingly obvious that the by passing of carter had been one of the real sins of omission in peace_prize history this year we can finally put all that behind us jimmy_carter only served one term as president of the united_states in a country where such importance is attached to outward success that has cast a shadow carter's principal concern was to do what he felt was right even when it was not the smartest political step to take our historical perspective enables us to see so much more clearly those features of carter's presidency that were forward looking we can see them in the middle_east we can see them in carter's work for disarmament and arms_control as president he admittedly launched a number of controversial weapons programs but that was only after he had failed to obtain soviet agreement to radical disarmament proposals carter was convinced that the weapon stockpiles held by the superpowers were far too big his so_called deep cut proposal in 1977 may not have been very realistic given the deep rooted scepticism of breshnev and the kremlin towards any sweeping reductions but it pointed forward to the kind of real disarmament agreements entered_into by his successors carter worked hard to prevent the spread of nuclear_weapons even when this created difficulties in relation to close allies the mediator in carter had already emerged when he was governor of georgia he intervened in a number of heated racial conflicts to prevent violence and instead find solutions that both parties could live with the peace between egypt and israel was the great triumph of his presidency but he also righted an old injustice by returning the panama canal to panama since the end of his presidential term carter's mediation efforts have been innumerable the most successful one was probably in haiti in 1994 in the last few years carter has given increasing emphasis to creating a broader foundation for mediation through the international negotiation network inn a network which includes several peace_prize laureates the fight for human_rights is probably the most frequently recurring theme in carter's lifework from his term as governor of georgia via his presidency and on to his many active years as an ex president when carter was elected_president the position of the united_states had been weakened by its war in vietnam and the support it had given to various dictatorships carter met the situation by going back to the heritage from woodrow_wilson and franklin d roosevelt the usa's strongest weapons are the ideals the country has stood for in its finest hours many people regarded carter's campaign for human_rights as naive idealism and interference in the internal affairs of other countries today we can see more clearly how important those efforts were in the soviet_union and in eastern_europe of course the issue of human_rights was also a weapon in the power struggle with the soviet_union but carter's work for human_rights in latin_america and in southern africa showed how much more was involved carter's activities as ex president testify to the genuineness of his commitment to human_rights carter and his staff at the carter center in atlanta which celebrates its twentieth anniversary this year have served as election observers at three dozen elections in twenty countries the centre has built up routines that have had and are still having a major influence on such work all over the world the same can be said of carter's election reports in 1989 his report that the elections in panama had not been lawfully conducted contributed to the withdrawal of all regional support for president noriega and ultimately to his removal in 1990 carter persuaded president ortega to acknowledge his election defeat in nicaragua few could be better placed than carter to explain with conviction that an election defeat does_not necessarily put an end to political activity only a few hours after digesting the news that he had been awarded the nobel peace_prize for 2002 carter was off on a new election assignment this time to jamaica as if mediation human_rights and disarmament were not enough the carter center has in cooperation with other organizations headed a number of important health campaigns so far the best results have been achieved in the fight_against guinea worm infection when the campaign began in 1986 over 3.2 million people in nineteen different asian and african countries were afflicted with this parasitic disease today the number of cases has been reduced by over 95 per_cent most of the remaining cases are to be found in civil war ridden sudan having overcome smallpox the world is now on the verge of exterminating another major epidemic disease the carter center also reports considerable progress in the fight_against river blindness in africa and latin_america more_than 15 million vaccinations have been carried_out the aim is to eliminate the disease on both continents by 2007 a third program is more geared to development through global 2000 the carter center is seeking to improve living conditions in a score of poor african countries it uses a wide range of instruments from reforestation and health initiatives to the introduction of new varieties of grain in the latter field the center has joined forces with another peace_prize laureate norman borlaug although there appears to be a long way to go there is hope that the green_revolution will produce the same good results in africa as in asia and latin_america one of the basic principles of the carter center is that people can improve their lives when provided with the necessary skills knowledge and access to resources this applies not only at the international level but also in the highest degree also at home in the united_states every year we see pictures of jimmy and rosalynn in a slum somewhere or other busy building housing for and together with the poor while there must have been good opportunities for an ex president to make money for himself carter has instead through habitat for humanity and the atlanta project wielded hammer and saw for the benefit of others as the norwegian_poet arnulf øverland says in his poem domestic decalogue to make someone else happy is the only happiness rosalynn is always at jimmy's side it is hard to recall any other american presidential couple who have stood together to the same extent in practically every connection this is how carter himself put it as long ago as in 1975 in the book why not the best when we emphasised here decided to enter politics rosalynn helped me from every standpoint we have been full partners in every major decision since we first married jimmy_carter has always preferred to look ahead not that he need be ashamed to look_back there is much in his four years in the white house that he can remember with pride but he is always setting himself new targets he has been the despair of historians also at the nobel institute who have tried to get him to talk about his presidency he would rather move on there is so much to do jimmy_carter sees this as his duty as a christian even when he was president he held sunday school classes and he still does his deep faith goes hand in hand with an exceptional degree of religious tolerance carter's work on so many fronts has been marked by the finest form of christian optimism he has often told his sunday school in plains that we'll never know whether something new and wonderful is possible unless we try let's scratch our heads stretch our minds be adventurous serve god with boldness and who knows what wonders the lord may work in the last paragraph of the reasons it gave for awarding this_year's peace_prize to jimmy_carter the norwegian_nobel committee mentioned a situation marked by threats of the use of power and emphasised that conflicts must as far as possible be resolved through negotiation and international co_operation based_on international_law respect for human_rights and economic development these are principles which carter has stood for ever more firmly these are the principles which the norwegian_nobel committee hopes that the international community will take as its guidelines in the difficult conflicts the world is facing today and will face in the years to come most of us become more conservative as we grow older with jimmy_carter the opposite seems to be the case in this respect he is an atypical pensioner growing with the years more and more radical and critical of society his criticism of those in power in his own_country and abroad has grown sharper one does_not have to agree with everything he says in order to admire his involvement jimmy_carter has evidently taken the advice of his favourite poet dylan thomas do not go gentle into that good night old age should burn and rave at the close of day jimmy_carter will probably not go down in american history as the most effective president but he is certainly the best ex president the country ever had and most importantly for us he is a most worthy recipient of the nobel peace_prize jimmy_carter stands out very clearly on the muster roll of life translation of the norwegian_text your_majesty your_royal highnesses peace_prize laureate excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has decided to award the nobel peace_prize for 2003 to shirin_ebadi for her efforts for democracy and human_rights she has focused especially on the campaign for the rights of women and children this was the first sentence of the committee's announcement on 10 october of this_year's peace_prize laureate i believe this announcement has already changed your life shirin_ebadi your name will shine in the history of the peace_prize let_us hope that the prize will also inspire changes in your beloved home country iran as well as in many other parts of the world where people need to hear your clear voice and let_me hasten to add this applies to the western world as well fundamental values such as liberty justice and respect for human_rights will in all places and at all times need vigilant and critical champions the great persian poet rumi or mowlavi as iranians like to call him lived in the 13th century somewhere in his great work mathnawi there is a short poem about a miserable wretch who came under attack by a ferocious dragon a heroic rescuer rushed in at the last moment and rumi's comment is there are such helpers in the world who rush to save anyone who cries out like mercy itself they run towards the screaming and they can't be bought off if you were to ask one of those why did you come so quickly he or she would say because i heard your helplessness another of the great persian poets saadi of shiraz who also lived in the 13th century says in the well_known work the rose garden golistan that he who is indifferent to the suffering of others is a traitor to that which is truly human dear shirin_ebadi you and the iranian people represent the tradition of saadi and rumi you are both guide and bridge builder you strive to bring people together across cultures races and religions that is your hallmark the norwegian_poet arne paasche aasen wrote in 1939 the lovely poem your youth about being young in spirit where he says now cries the world we need your heart your gifts your flaming spirit and were you to be given youth to have and keep then use it use all your energy and powers dear shirin_ebadi you are young in spirit you possess great gifts you have a warm heart you are brave we admire your efforts the world needs you congratulations with the 2003 nobel peace_prize the norwegian_nobel committee is convinced that the peace_prize has been awarded to the right person at the right time and in the right place when the director of the nobel institute telephoned shirin ebadi's home in teheran to tell her the good news her husband answered that his wife was in paris and would not be easy to get hold of she had forgotten her mobile telephone at home nevertheless the news that you had been awarded the nobel peace_prize reached you very quickly in paris and the entire conference broke_out in enthusiastic jubilation later we learned that you were not even aware that you had been nominated for the nobel peace_prize but then reactions started pouring in not everyone knew your name but the world understood immediately what the committee meant all people are entitled to fundamental rights and at a time when islam is being demonized in many quarters of the western world it was the norwegian_nobel committee's wish to underline how important and how valuable it is to foster dialogue between peoples and between civilizations this is a wish that most people share and that is why the reactions to this_year's award have been so positive even_though we understand if you had perhaps hoped for a few more congratulations from the authorities of your own home country and region and now of course you have suddenly become quite a world celebrity today you are here shirin_ebadi in oslo city hall to receive the nobel peace_prize for 2003 and we rejoice together with you your closest family and friends many of whom are present here_today it is indeed a great pleasure for the norwegian_nobel committee to award for the first time in history the nobel peace_prize to a woman from the muslim world a woman that the world can be proud of as can all other champions of human_rights around the world it is our sincere hope that the people of iran will feel joy that a citizen of their country for the first time in history receives the nobel peace_prize and we hope that the prize will serve as inspiration for all those_who are campaigning for human_rights and democracy in your country in the muslim world and in all countries in the east and west everywhere where human_rights work needs inspiration and support shirin_ebadi has been awarded the nobel peace_prize for her efforts for democracy and human_rights and in particular for her fight for the rights of women and children she has been very clear in her opposition to patriarchal cultures that deny equal rights to women who represent half of the population but mothers must also be aware of their responsibilities they are the ones who bring up young boys to be men and who raise daughters to become strong women shirin_ebadi is the founder and leader of the association for support of children's rights in iran which has some 5000 members the centre is located in teheran and it produces information material for use in schools and operates an emergency hot line for children the nobel_committee hopes that the nobel peace_prize award to shirin_ebadi will contribute to an increased focus on the rights of children the world over in an interview shirin_ebadi was asked do you have a message to send to muslim women yes she answered keep on fighting don't believe that you are meant to occupy a lower position in society get yourself an education do your best and compete in all areas of life god created us all as equals by fighting for equal status we are doing what god wants us to do argues shirin_ebadi in this respect it is worth noting that some 60 percent of the students at the university of teheran are in fact women at the same_time we must not forget women's legitimate claim for equality before the law in law and order we must all be equal and women must enjoy exactly the same rights as men on this issue shirin_ebadi stands in the front ranks and we can but admire her for her efforts many are those_who have drawn benefit from shirin ebadi's commitment and capacity for work she has pleaded the cause of refugees in a region where they are in such great numbers and so desperately need help furthermore she has called attention to the rights of all citizens also their right to freedom of expression irrespective of religion ethnic origin or political opinion as a lawyer judge lecturer author and activist her voice has sounded clearly and powerfully in her native country iran and also far_beyond its national borders she has come forward with professional force and unflagging courage and she has defied any danger to her own safety she is truly a woman of the people the campaign for fundamental human_rights is her most_important arena and no society can be called civilized if the rights of women and children fail to be respected at a time of violence she has staunchly upheld the principle of non_violence for her it is fundamental that the supreme political power of a society is founded on democratic elections she emphasizes that information and dialogue constitute the best avenue toward a change of attitudes and a settling of conflicts after years of reflection she has come to the conclusion that revolution never leads to the changes promised by the revolutionaries the road forward must move in the direction of non_violence and dialogue law and order again and again this_year's laureate has stressed that she is an iranian i_am proud to be an iranian i shall live in iran for as long as i possibly can she says for shirin_ebadi this has meant a life in fear but she has learned to live with her fear and she is optimistic about the future people insist on ruling themselves the time when ruling powers could threaten their way to dominion is gone forever rulers will realize that the time for governing through fear is drawing to a close the world over why should iran be an exception she says the 110 persons and organizations that have been awarded the nobel peace_prize over the years are extremely diverse but the majority of them have one thing in common they are optimists unshakable optimists it is their optimism that gives them the inspiration they need in their struggles furthermore many of the laureates are filled with a courage that we can scarcely understand even under the most challenging of circumstances they keep going day after day year after year shirin_ebadi has run great risks as a lawyer she brings cases to court that few others would venture to get involved in her ideas are spreading in ever widening circles and to quote the norwegian_poet paasche aasen you must be true to your own youth so that the field you plough can grow when your work is done there are several long lines running through the 102 years of nobel peace_prize history in the last few_decades the most distinct of these has perhaps been the increasing emphasis that the norwegian_nobel committee has placed on democracy and human_rights who was the first to receive the peace_prize according to this tradition is open for debate was it the prize awarded to woodrow_wilson in 1919 or to carl_von ossietzky in 1935 or even the 1951 prize to the french union leader léon_jouhaux although human_rights represent one dimension of all these three awards there were also other dimensions involved hence the first indisputable human_rights prize was perhaps after all the one awarded to albert_lutuli of south_africa in 1960 in the more_than four decades since many such prizes have followed some names shine brighter than others martin_luther king 1964 andrei_sakharov 1975 amnesty_international 1977 lech_walesa 1983 desmond_tutu 1984 aung_san suu_kyi 1991 and she is especially in our thoughts today rigoberta_menchú 1992 and nelson_mandela 1993 and then this year shirin_ebadi it is against this backdrop that we can more easily understand what this_year's laureate has achieved and what the consequences of such a prize can be when it works at its best the idea of human_rights and democracy is gaining ground albeit slowly practising human_rights is always a challenge high demands will always be placed on those_who wish to live up to their ideals it is with great satisfaction that we see that the idea of people's right to govern themselves through free elections is gradually prevailing in many parts of the world by comparison to only 10 15 years_ago all of eastern_europe russia and several other countries of the former soviet_union many states in eastern asia and not least in latin_america as well as a few in africa have now adopted democratic forms of government perhaps the norwegian_nobel committee is able to stimulate a development that still has mainly local roots and explanations every nation must fight its own battle but we who stand on the outside looking in can express our sympathy and make our contribution shirin_ebadi is a conscious muslim she sees no conflict between islam and fundamental human_rights islam is a diverse religion how the message of justice is to be realized in practice and how human integrity is to be preserved is an essential issue for muslims of today we shall listen to all positive novel interpretations all proposals of reform here too women have an important role to play no_longer is it for elderly men to interpret the message argue many muslim women those_who kill in the name of islam they violate islam says shirin_ebadi we know that human_rights are being violated not only in muslim countries it happens whether regimes our religious or secular nationalistic or marxist for shirin_ebadi therefore it is not religion that is the deepest root cause of the problem but no matter what state and religion should be separate is her view since the political arena should be open to so many diverse interests and views shirin_ebadi underlines that the dialogue between different cultures in the world must be founded on the values they have in common there need be no fundamental conflict between islam and christianity that is why she was pleased that the pope was among the first to congratulate her on the peace_prize it is possible that the peace_prize may in the short term have led to more hostilities than peace in the homeland of some peace_prize laureates but the nobel_committee's acknowledgement of democracy and human_rights rests on the belief that repression cannot persist in the long_run in the last few_decades in particular we have seen how large parts of the world have abruptly thrown off the yoke of dictatorship repression leads to conflict most people will simply not put up with the peace of the graveyard and one of the most certain findings of modern political science is precisely that democracies do not go to war against each_other i appeal to all individuals all peoples and to all nations of the world let_us work together for a better world let build peace and prevent war let_us make the world a better place to live in for young and for old let_us focus on human integrity and human_rights let_us fight_against poverty and disease in the world let justice respect and cooperation prevail among peoples and nations of the world let_us together realize the dream of world peace as the university man that i_am i challenge all universities the world over to be even more distinct in underscoring the world's need for peace democracy and social and economic justice dear peace_prize laureate shirin_ebadi we admire your efforts for human_rights in general and your struggle for the rights of women and children in particular we admire your work for peace without resorting to violence we admire your work for dialogue between religions of the world we hope that the nobel peace_prize may contribute to the realization of your dream allow me finally to revert to the great poet rumi who wanted to expose everything that prevents us from seeing the world as it is and who also tells_us that the vision or dream leads to clear sightedness in a poem whose norwegian title is draumen som må tolkast the dream that must be interpreted rumi says and although we seem to sleep there is an inner vigilant voice that steers the dream that will finally awake us to the truth about who we are the great norwegian_poet olav h hauge also had a dream he has written the beautiful poem it's the dream that i would like to conclude with it's the dream we carry in secret that something miraculous will happen that must happen that time will open that the heart will open that doors will open that mountains will open that springs will gush that the dream will open that one morning we will glide into some harbour we didn't know was there congratulations shirin_ebadi and all the best of luck in your future endeavours english norwegian your_majesties your_royal highnesses peace_prize laureate your_excellencies ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has decided to award the nobel peace_prize for 2004 to wangari_maathai for her contribution to sustainable development democracy and peace peace on earth depends on our ability to secure our living environment maathai stands at the front of the fight to promote ecologically viable social economic and cultural development in kenya and in africa she has taken a holistic approach to sustainable development that embraces democracy human_rights and women's rights in particular she thinks globally and acts locally these are the opening sentences of the committee's statement of its reasons for this_year's peace_prize award on the 8th of october my god my god wangari_maathai exclaimed when the director of the nobel institute called her on a poor mobile phone connection to tell her that she had been awarded the nobel peace_prize for 2004 she bubbled over with joy and the news was all over the world in an instant a good twenty minutes before the official announcement in oslo maathai was visiting the little village of ihururu 95 kilometres north of nairobi distributing food from the government her kenyan listeners mostly women clapped politely when she told them that she had been awarded the peace_prize but they laughed out loud when she told them that she had been given so much money that she couldn't even count it today wangari_maathai you are here in the oslo town hall to receive the nobel peace_prize for 2004 we share your joy with you and with your closest relatives and friends who are gathered here we are also pleased to see so many kenyans and other africans in the town hall we have all come together here to pay you our tribute dear mama wangari_maathai you have shown what it means to be a true african mother and a true african woman kenya admires you africa admires you the world admires you may your unceasing fight for the right always remain a source of inspiration for mankind i think the announcement has already changed your life your name will figure prominently in the history of the peace_prize together with the other african peace_prize laureates albert_lutuli anwar sadat desmond_tutu nelson_mandela fredrik willem de_klerk and kofi_annan we hope the peace_prize may be an inspiration for positive change in your beloved kenya in africa and in the many countries in the world that need to hear your voice congratulations on the nobel peace_prize for 2004 wangari_maathai was born in 1940 in the provincial capital nyeri north of nairobi and within sight of mighty mount kenya most unusually for african girls from the provinces she received higher education in kenya on completing her kenyan education she went to the united_states where she took a bachelor's and a master's degree in 1971 she became the first woman in kenya to take a doctorate subsequently becoming the first female professor at the university of nairobi as a biologist she saw the problems that deforestation and soil erosion were causing in rural areas especially for the women who do most of the physical work grazing areas for livestock were being destroyed the women were having to go further and further in search of wood for cooking in 1977 maathai took an important decision she resigned from her chair and on the 5th of june world environment day she planted nine trees in her backyard and founded the green belt movement its aim was to restore africa's forests and put an end to the poverty that deforestation was causing in the 1980s maathai became the chairperson of the national council of women and her successes with tree planting and political campaigning for women brought her into conflict with the authorities she thus also became one of the leaders of the pro democracy movement when the government wanted to build a 62 storey skyscraper in uhuru park the only park in the centre of nairobi maathai organized the protests thanks to which the building plans were abandoned the struggles for the environment for democracy and for women's rights all came together to form a whole in due course many men also joined her movement maathai's many initiatives exposed her to harassment she was repeatedly sent to prison she was attacked with tear gas and clubbed the government met with little success in its efforts to curb this awkward woman maathai became internationally known and won numerous prizes for her work she was elected to parliament in 2002 the year when daniel arap moi finally had to relinquish power after subjecting the country to increasingly authoritarian rule ever_since 1978 in 2003 in the broad coalition government that took over maathai was appointed deputy minister of environment natural resources and wildlife you are the first woman from africa to be honoured with the nobel peace_prize you will also be the first african from the vast region between south_africa and egypt to receive the prize you stand as an example and a source of inspiration to everyone in africa who is fighting for sustainable development democracy and peace you are an outstanding role model for all women in africa and the rest of the world you bravely opposed the oppressive regime in kenya your unique modes of action put the spotlight on political oppression both nationally and internationally you combine science commitment active politics and faith in god beyond simply preserving the existing environment your strategy is to safeguard and strengthen the foundations for sustainable development your goal is to protect god's creation so that this earth can become the garden of eden that god created from 1950 to 2000 kenya lost 90 per_cent of its forests you founded the green belt movement in which over a period of nearly thirty_years you have mobilised poor women to plant thirty million trees your methods have also been adopted in other countries we are all witnesses to how deforestation and forest loss have led to desertification in africa and threatened many other regions of the world also in europe protecting forests to stop desertification is a major step towards strengthening our common global environment through education family planning nutrition and the fight_against corruption the green belt movement is creating conditions for development at grass root level the norwegian_nobel committee has for a long time maintained that there are many different paths to peace the committee's peace concept is in other words a broad one this explains why many different categories of persons and organizations have received the nobel peace_prize statesmen and politicians can contribute at the international the regional and the national level and many have been awarded the prize major humanitarian organizations and individuals engaged in humanitarian work have also been recognized humanitarian work must in the highest degree be seen as promoting the fraternity_between nations of which alfred_nobel speaks in his will the many awards to those_who have worked for disarmament or arms_control relate directly to the abolition_or reduction of standing_armies that nobel also mentions in recent decades the nobel_committee has made human_rights a central element of the definition of peace there were many warnings against such a broadening of the concept of peace today there are few things peace researchers and other scholars are readier to agree on than precisely that democracy and human_rights advance peace the norwegian_nobel committee has believed so for over forty_years if not indeed much longer this year the norwegian_nobel committee has evidently broadened its definition of peace still further environmental protection has become yet another path to peace let_me be quick to add that wangari_maathai has been a leading spokeswoman for democracy and human_rights and especially women's rights both under daniel arap moi and in today's kenya in this connection she stands firmly on the same ground as many earlier laureates what is so impressive about maathai's work is its comprehensiveness but it was the committee's own decision to emphasise its environmental dimension so what in fact is the relationship_between the environment and peace most people would probably agree that there are connections between peace on the one hand and an environment on the other in which scarce resources such as oil water minerals or timber are quarrelled over the middle_east is full of disputes relating to oil and water clearly not everyone outside the region has appreciated the importance to arab israeli relations of the conflicts over the waters of the jordan litani orontes and other rivers competition for minerals has been an important element of several conflicts in africa in recent_years competition for timber has figured prominently in liberia in indonesia and in brazil present day wars and conflicts take place not so much between as within states but where does tree planting come in when we analyse local conflicts we tend to focus on their ethnic and religious aspects but it is often the underlying ecological circumstances that bring the more readily visible factors to the flashpoint consider the conflict in darfur in the sudan what catches the eye is that this is a conflict between arabs and africans between the government various armed militia groups and civilians below this surface however lies the desertification that has taken_place in the last few_decades especially in northern darfur the desert has spread southwards forcing arab nomads further and further south year by year bringing them into conflict with african farmers in the philippines uncontrolled deforestation has helped to provoke a rising against the authorities in mexico soil erosion and deforestation have been factors in the revolt in chiapas against the central government in haiti in amazonas and in the himalayas deforestation and the resulting soil erosion have contributed to deteriorating living conditions and caused tension between population groups and countries in many countries deforestation often together with other problems leads to migration to the big cities where the lack of infrastructure is another source of further conflict can all this not be said more simply maathai herself has put it like this we are sharing our resources in a very inequitable way we have parts of the world that are very deprived and parts of the world that are very rich and that is partly the reason why we have conflicts wars and conflicts certainly have many other causes too but who would deny that inequitable distribution locally and internationally is relevant in this connection i predict that within a few_decades when researchers have developed more comprehensive analyses of many of the world's conflicts the relation between the environment resources and conflict may seem almost as obvious as the connection we see today between human_rights democracy and peace another thing that needs to be said in this context is that sooner or later in order to meet environmental problems there will have to be international cooperation across all national_boundaries on a much larger scale than we have seen up to now we live on the same globe we must all cooperate to meet the world's environmental challenges together we are strong divided we are weak not long ago i was invited to the village school where i come from to tell the pupils about peace_prize laureate maathai afterwards the pupils planted a tree in the school garden a peace tree there was ceremony in the schoolyard let_me challenge schools in africa in norway and in the rest of the world to plant a tree a peace tree in their school gardens that is how concrete the peace concept can be children can understand it the norwegian_poet halldis moren vesaas has put it so beautifully in her poem the woman is planting the woman is planting a tree in the world on her knees like someone in prayer among the remains of the many trees that the storm has broken down she must try again perhaps one at last will be left to grow in peace and this is how moren vesaas ends the poem she sees the hands outspread on the earth as if trying to impose her calm on its threatening tremors oh earth be still be still so my tree can grow in its award to you wangari_maathai of the nobel peace_prize for 2004 the nobel_committee wishes to pay a special tribute to and express special support for the women of africa and in the rest of the world africa's women have at all times been of the greatest importance to the development of the continent they have borne the heaviest burdens the woman has worked the land right up to the present she has done about 80 per_cent of the work of food production once the man has cleared the land the rest is the woman's work she has gone out into the fields at dawn she has hoed she has sowed she has watered she has weeded she has harvested from the harvest she prepares the food for her family she has also done much of the work with the livestock she has walked and walked in erect dignity with a child on her back and a load on her head millions of women still walk and walk to find fuel for their cooking pots and water for their housekeeping going to market is also the women's province in africa as they are responsible for the food for their families women organize their work so that they can exchange what they produce and need at the market women bear an average of six children each a heavy strain under the prevailing living conditions with no men in one third of all households women have moreover been particularly hard hit by africa's hiv aids epidemic no_doubt wangari_maathai will in the years ahead be at the forefront of africa's fight_against hiv aids neither states nor families in africa have given priority to providing equal educational opportunities for girls and boys for women and men where college and university education is concerned fewer than 10 per_cent of the age group are students compared to over half in many western countries only one quarter of the students taking higher education in africa are women more extensive education for women offers a vast potential for improving african living conditions wangari_maathai has shown us what rich fruit education can bear africa's women have borne heavy burdens but then africa has also brought forth strong women one of the strongest stands before us here_today sometimes we all feel that the challenges confronting us are simply too great that is when we need optimism it is easier to be optimistic if we take the long view few people have put this better than mahatma_gandhi when i despair i remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won there have been murderers and tyrants and for a time they seem invincible but in the end they always fall think of it always today in celebrating wangari_maathai as nobel peace_prize laureate for 2004 i have made my own little poem inspired by a speech by prime_minister tony blair let_us make africa a better place to live let_us make africa a better place to grow children let_us make africa a better place to get old let_us make africa a better place to lead a full life let_us make africa the millennium continent let_us make peace with justice in the whole world congratulations twakupongeza tunasema asante sana swahili we thank_you and thank_you so much your_majesties your_royal highness nobel peace_prize laureates your_excellencies ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has decided that the nobel peace_prize for 2005 is to be shared in two equal parts between the international atomic energy agency iaea and its director_general mohamed elbaradei for their efforts to prevent nuclear_energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that nuclear_energy for peaceful purposes is used in the safest possible way at a time when the threat of nuclear_arms is again increasing the norwegian_nobel committee_wishes to underline that this threat must be met through the broadest possible international cooperation this principle finds its clearest expression today in the work of the iaea and its director_general in the nuclear non_proliferation regime it is the iaea which controls that nuclear_energy is not misused for military purposes and the director_general has stood out as a bold advocate of new measures to strengthen that regime at a time when disarmament efforts appear deadlocked when there is a danger that nuclear_arms will spread both to states and to terrorist groups and when nuclear power again appears to be playing an increasingly significant role this work is of incalculable importance the vision underlying the iaea stems from president dwight d eisenhower in december 1953 he gave his famous atoms for peace speech at the united_nations the vision was surprisingly concrete the nuclear powers should make joint contributions from their stockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials to an international atomic energy agency the most_important task for the iaea would be to devise methods whereby this fissionable material would be allocated to serve the peaceful pursuits of mankind the iaea was in other words to receive potentially military nuclear material from the nuclear powers and then distribute it for peaceful use to the countries that were most in need of it the iaea was formally established on 29 july 1957 for the purpose of preventing military use and stimulating peaceful use of nuclear_energy implicitly in the iaea statutes but all the more explicitly in the non_proliferation treaty npt of 1970 which was to mean so much to the iaea the five original nuclear powers are under an obligation to reduce nuclear_weapons globally with the ultimate goals of eliminating those weapons this important point has been repeated on a number of subsequent occasions despite several arms limitation agreements the traditional nuclear powers can by no means be said to have come much closer to this goal although the number of nuclear_weapons deployed has been reduced tens of thousands of them remain about as many as when the npt entered_into force as well as a continuing interest in the development of new weapon types this is one main reason why further non_proliferation efforts have stalled the nuclear powers must take their obligations under the npt seriously it is hypocritical to go on developing one's own nuclear_weapons while doing everything in one's power to prevent others from acquiring such weapons as elbaradei himself has put it it is like some who have continued to dangle a cigarette from their mouth and tell everybody else not to smoke the number of nuclear powers in the world has risen in addition to the usa russia great_britain france and china israel india and pakistan have nuclear_arms perhaps north_korea too this is not to say that there have been no positive developments south_africa discontinued its program thus becoming the first country to have developed nuclear_weapons only to abandon them all credit to south_africa belorussia ukraine and kazakhstan renounced the nuclear_weapons which the soviet_union had left behind in their territories libya has reversed its policy argentina brazil taiwan south_korea and turkey have given up ambitious programs nevertheless proliferation continues it has to be stopped the iaea has met with both successes and reverses in its struggle to prevent the spread of nuclear_arms iraq illustrates both initially the iaea failed to uncover the extensive program which saddam hussein had developed in the 1980s that necessitated new routines on the other_hand in cooperation with the united_nations special commission on iraq unscom and the united_nations monitoring verification and inspection commission unmovic the iaea then managed in the 1990s to destroy such weapons of mass destruction as did exist in the period prior to the invasion of iraq in 2003 the iaea and unmovic were under heavy pressure despite which the inspectors carried_out their task in iraq in an independent thorough and correct manner as the world could see after the war in iraq the weapons that were not found proved not to have existed in north_korea the iaea discovered that the north koreans had lied about their nuclear program since then however it has not been given any opportunity to carry_out the inspections in north_korea which are certainly necessary with respect to iran too the iaea has had both ups and downs iran managed to keep its nuclear program concealed for 18 years for the past two years however the iaea has undertaken important work there with some degree of success the tense situation in the country can only be resolved provided the iaea is allowed to carry_out the necessary inspections and its steps and resolutions are respected keeping pace with the many challenges with which it has been confronted in the last few years the iaea has managed to tighten up the control it exercises also by carrying_out special inspections at short notice it has done a good job in a number of difficult contexts at a time when international organizations have been heavily criticised the iaea has not only maintained but even in many respects strengthened its position its security control enables the organization to exercise functions that were previously the preserve of national authorities in so far as it has encroached on national sovereignty this control has broken new ground complete sovereignty in the nuclear field means complete insecurity for the rest of the world the central figure in this strengthening of the iaea has been director_general elbaradei he has himself put_forward numerous proposals aimed_at this objective he is an active participant in debates on the future of the non_proliferation regime while building on the important work of his predecessors and of hans blix in particular he has managed to strengthen still further the positions both of the director_general and of the iaea his recent re election for a third term will open up new opportunities in the years ahead both for him and for the iaea today's award is thus very much a tribute to mohamet elbaradei in person but is also intended to recognise the 2,300 staff from 90 countries who currently work for the iaea as well as the many who worked there before many are here_today we salute you and thank_you for your work for the iaea it has been and still is very important to help the poor countries of the world to participate in the use of nuclear_energy for peaceful purposes refraining from military uses should make it possible to help such countries with civilian uses such peaceful use has been controversial in many countries however and there has consequently been no increase in recent_years nuclear_energy currently accounts for about 16 per_cent of global electricity production but nearly all of this is in highly developed countries growth today is taking place principally in russia china india and brazil the main reasons for the growth are energy shortages high oil prices the need to reduce co2 emissions and enhanced operational safety although opinions differ on the civilian use of nuclear_energy we should all be able to agree on the importance of ensuring that the use that does take place is made as safe as possible if we do see further growth in this sector control arrangements will become all the more essential this forms a major part of the work of the iaea incidentally many of us may not pause to reflect on the prominent position of nuclear_energy in the health services especially in the treatment of cancer as well as in connection with agriculture the environment and industry the award to the iaea and to elbaradei is firmly founded in the history of the peace_prize and in alfred_nobel's will in which he mentions the abolition_or reduction of standing_armies as one of the three criteria for the award nobel would surely have agreed that in our day the struggle_against nuclear_arms must be even more urgent than opposition to standing_armies this_year's prize to the iaea and elbaradei links together the two principal major lines of thought that have governed selections for the award throughout its history again and again the norwegian_nobel committee has stressed the need for a better_organized world this explains the many prizes to representatives of the inter parliamentary union before world war i to representatives of the league of nations in the inter war years and to individuals and organizations attached to the united_nations after world war ii in 2001 year of the centenary of the nobel prizes it was therefore only natural to give the award to the united_nations and to its secretary_general kofi_annan this year it is 60 years since the foundation of the united_nations the iaea is very much a part of the un system and consequently belongs under this most distinct of all headings in the history of the peace_prize a second and almost equally prominent theme has been work for disarmament and arms_control many laureates have advocated disarmament and peace in general even in the nuclear field a number of prizes have been awarded to linus_pauling in 1962 for his work for a nuclear test_ban agreement to andrei_sakharov in 1975 for campaigning for nuclear disarmament and democracy to alva_myrdal and garcia robles in 1982 for seeking non_proliferation to international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war in 1985 working across the east west divide and to the pugwash conferences and joseph rotblat in 1995 for the important work they did for nuclear disarmament especially at the expert level it has been claimed that every tenth year the norwegian_nobel committee awards the prize to someone seeking the abolition of nuclear_weapons with the awards of 1975 1985 and 1995 in mind it is difficult for the committee to deny the charge but such awards have as you have heard been made more frequently than once a decade and it was not the case in 2005 that the committee had zeroed in on this field in advance it would be truer to say that when the committee after a long discussion of this_year's 199 candidates finally selected the iaea and elbaradei we came to the realisation that once_again the prize was going to someone who favours reducing the importance of nuclear_arms in international politics the atom bombs fell on hiroshima and nagasaki 60 years_ago since then the world has been united in the wish that nothing like that must ever happen again such weapons are so dreadful that they are meaningless in war naturally enough memories of the atom bombs have been strongest of all in japan where people who survived the two atom bombs can still be found the survivors have a special name hibakusha and their own organization nihon hidankyo we salute them today it is accordingly highly appropriate even_though it is a coincidence that it is the japanese ambassador to the iaea yukiya amano who is at present the chairman of the organization's board of governors and who will therefore receive the one half of the award on_behalf of the iaea let_us recall the story of the little girl sadako sasaki who as an infant was exposed to radiation from the hiroshima bomb suffering as a twelve year old from deadly leukaemia she heard the japanese legend which tells_us that if you fold one thousand cranes you can wish for anything you like and sadako began folding a thousand cranes wishing to get well according to popular legend she died when she had folded 644 birds her classmates folded the remaining 356 sadako was buried with a wreath of 1,000 cranes her classmates and friends had a granite statue of her erected in the peace park in hiroshima the statue shows sadako as a young girl with her arms out and with a crane in her hand thousands of folded cranes are left by the statue every year most of us dream of a future without nuclear_weapons we would finally be rid of the threat to mankind's very existence which the weapons represent those_who do not dream of such a future tend to say that nuclear_arms can not be uninvented and maintain that if and when a war does break_out there will be pressure to develop nuclear_arms again the answer to this was given by joseph rotblat the 1995 laureate for whom a memorial ceremony was held in london yesterday our long_term vision must be to put an end to war as such we must banish war in the same way as the world has largely succeeded in banishing slavery the commonest of social institutions several nobel peace prizes have been awarded to the many who oppose nuclear_weapons the successes have nevertheless been few and the setbacks many even the iaea has had disappointments but we can not give up the basic challenge still confronts us in the words of the russell einstein manifesto of 1955 here then is the problem which we present to you stark and dreadful and inescapable shall we put an end to the human race or shall we renounce war that is the question shall we put an end to the human race or shall we renounce war here is how the norwegian author nordahl grieg put it in his poem to youth war is contempt for life peace is creative at it with all your might see death defeated we congratulate you mohamed elbaradei and we congratulate the iaea on being awarded this_year's nobel peace_prize we thank_you for what you have done and hope for further advances in work that is so vital to us all your_majesties your_royal highnesses laureates excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has decided to award the nobel peace_prize for 2006 divided into two equal parts to muhammad_yunus and grameen_bank for their efforts to create economic and social development from below lasting peace can not be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break_out of poverty micro_credit is one such means development from below also serves to advance democracy and human_rights those were the words in which the nobel peace_prize award was announced on the 13 th of october this year today the time has come for well deserved celebration muhammad_yunus and grameen_bank congratulations on the nobel peace_prize and congratulations to you mosammat taslima begum who will receive the prize on_behalf of grameen_bank not all the journalists covering the announcement of the award at the nobel institute knew who yunus and grameen_bank were some thought grameen_bank was a person let that be the reporters problem the many who did know of both held that they ought to have received the peace_prize long ago in 2002 bill clinton put it this way dr yunus is a man who long ago should have won the nobel prize and i'll keep saying that until they finally give it to him now clinton will no_longer need to remind us this_year's award has been well received internationally in norway and not least in bangladesh it almost defies comprehension that when as chairman of the nobel_committee i walk up to a microphone at the nobel institute in oslo and announce that this_year's peace_prize is going to yumus and grameen_bank politicians and papers in large parts of the world begin to comment on and to a large_extent to applaud the norwegian_nobel committee's choice and what is even harder to believe there is an outbreak of joyful demonstrations in bangladesh for several days one could almost have described the country as closed because of happiness many said that this was the greatest thing to have happened to the country since independence in 1971 in recent weeks growing numbers of people have become acquainted with the outlines of yunus's exciting story trained in economics in the united_states he returned to bangladesh in 1972 and took a chair in economics at the university of chittagong in 1974 he underwent a personal crisis during the country's famine it shook him to see such poverty and he asked himself what is the point of all these splendid economic theories when people around me are dying of hunger as early as in 1976 he hit on the idea of opening a bank for poor people he lent 27 dollars out of his own pocket to 42 craftsmen in a little village in bangladesh telling them that they could pay the money back when they could afford to in the weeks that followed he gave the matter a great_deal of thought and decided that there would have to be an institutional solution the result was grameen_bank which is present today in the vast majority of bangladesh's thousands of villages and which since its formal opening in 1983 has lent almost six billion dollars today the bank has almost seven million borrowers grameen_bank lends 800 million dollars per year in loans averaging just over one hundred dollars the bank is self financing and makes a profit the repayment percentage is very high muhammad_yunus says lend the poor money in amounts which suit them teach them a few sound financial principles and they manage on their own by means of this_year's peace_prize award the norwegian_nobel committee_wishes to focus attention on dialogue with the muslim world on the women's perspective and on the fight_against poverty first we hope that this peace_prize will represent a possible approach to the muslim part of the world since the 11th of september 2001 we have seen a widespread tendency to demonize islam it is an important task for the nobel_committee to try to narrow the gap between the west and islam the peace_prize to yunus and grameen_bank is also support for the muslim country bangladesh and for the muslim environments in the world that are working for dialogue and collaboration all too often we speak one sidedly about how much the muslim part of the world has to learn from the west where micro_credit is concerned the opposite is true the west has learned from yunus from bangladesh and from the muslim part of the world secondly this_year's peace_prize places women centre stage over 95 per_cent of the borrowers are women and their liberation is a major concern for yunus and grameen_bank the emphasis on women may have been the most_important factor in the success of their work women were not alone to begin with but their proportion rose rapidly in yunus's words for women to be granted the loan has a definite effect on the family there is no need to do more research on that today children benefit automatically with better clothes and food we can see the situation changing men often spend the money on themselves women spend it on the family the bank's practice has meant a social revolution in bangladesh one of the borrowers mazeda begum has put it like this my parents gave me the birth but grameen_bank gave me a life in today's terminology micro_credit is indeed female empowerment micro_credit has proved itself to be a liberating force in societies where women in particular have to struggle_against repressive social and economic conditions economic_growth and political democracy can not achieve their full potential unless the female half of humanity on earth contributes on an equal footing with the male thirdly and most importantly we have the fight_against poverty and for social and economic development muhammad_yunus has shown himself to be a leader who has managed to turn visions into practical action for the benefit of millions of people not only in bangladesh but also in many other countries there are now micro_credit programs in nearly one hundred countries all over the world including norway loans to poor people most often women without any financial security had appeared to be an impossible idea from modest beginnings three decades ago yunus has first and foremost through grameen_bank developed micro_credit into an ever more important instrument in the struggle_against poverty grameen_bank has been a source of ideas and models for the many institutions in the field of micro_credit that have sprung up around the world numbers soon multiply and swell but behind each number there is an individual human being every_single person on earth has both the potential and the right to live a decent life across cultures and civilisations yunus and grameen_bank have shown that the poor can work to bring_about their own development in yunus's words micro_credit is a well tried and well founded method that can bring financial services to the poorest of the poor micro_credit promotes entrepreneurship and puts each individual poor person especially women in the driving seat in their own lives even beggars have become borrowers in the bank yunus believes firmly that alms destroy the initiative and creativity of poor people as he wanders about in his bengalese clothes yunus is sometimes referred to as a modern gandhi he is called the banker of the poorest and grameen_bank which means the village bank is the world's biggest bank for poor people through their deposits poor people own 94 per_cent of the bank the remaining 6 per_cent belong to the government of bangladesh the bank is based_on a different philosophy from that of normal banks yunus says micro_credit is more about people than about money it is a question of trusting people credit means to trust to give someone credit the poor people organize themselves into groups often of five women it is the group that is granted the loan and is responsible for repayment the group meets regularly to sharpen each other's perceptions of borrowing work repayment and saving the members undertake to work for food production pure drinking water hygiene health family planning economy discipline community and motivation in the group and in their families the groups form networks with other groups at the grass roots level the groups thus help to build_up communities groups of women who assume responsibility have also recently been points of departure for vaccination and health programs the struggle_against poverty in the world is an existential struggle for survival today roughly half the world's people live on less_than two dollars a day and more_than one billion live on less_than one dollar a day which is extreme poverty this means that the majority of people on earth are poor and the majority of them are women and children this may be the greatest challenge confronting the world over the next few_decades every country and nation in the world must contribute it is shameful that far over half the people in the world live under such conditions the struggle_against poverty is work for peace of the first order the secretary_general of the united_nations nobel peace_prize laureate kofi_annan has said that today borders do not go between nations but between the powerful and the powerless the free and the enslaved the privileged and the subservient the united_nations number one millennium development goal is to halve global poverty by 2015 achieving that goal will require global mobilisation will you join in will your country join in will national leaders join in to meet this challenge there is a long way to go but we must travel it together the aim must be peace with justice in the world and justice means a life in dignity the norwegian_nobel committee underlines that lasting peace can not be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break_out of poverty peace with justice must be built from below by means to which muhammad_yunus and grameen_bank have contributed the norwegian_nobel committee is often asked which concept of peace it applies the question has come up this year too although the response to this_year's award to muhammad_yunus and grameen_bank has been generally favourable some have asked what micro_credit has to do with peace they deserve an answer the point of departure is always alfred_nobel's will but the fact is that the three criteria for the peace_prize which nobel mentions in his will work for fraternity_between nations for the abolition_or reduction of standing_armies and for the holding of peace congresses only provide limited guidance that leaves it to a large_extent up to the norwegian_nobel committee itself to interpret and concretize the concept of peace ever_since 1901 this has been a matter for dispute if not so much within the committee as in the public domain when the very first prize was awarded to henri_dunant and frédéric passy nearly everyone accepted the pacifist passy to some however dunant presented a problem was his work relevant to peace certainly the red_cross did excellent work once war had broken out but what did they do to prevent war the earliest prizes went to peace activists of various kinds to statesmen and as we have seen to humanitarian organizations and persons then the committee began awarding the peace_prize to campaigners for human_rights again there were prompt counter arguments what did human_rights have to do with peace did not the emphasis on such rights on the contrary tend to arouse conflict in the 1980s however a growing number of political scientists began to take an interest in immanuel kant's analyses of the connection between democracy and peace in due course more and more of them came to the conclusion that democracies were peaceful at least in relation to other democracies this has now become one of the most robust findings in modern political science it is gratifying to see science now giving its almost unanimous support to a view which the norwegian_nobel committee has held for decades in 2004 the nobel_committee maintained that there was a connection between a depleted environment and war and conflict this year the theme is the struggle_against poverty what has that got to do with peace this is not something the norwegian_nobel committee only hit on this year many previous prizes have gone to the struggle_against poverty the distinction between humanitarian work and the struggle_against poverty is of course not clear as the three prizes to the red_cross and the awards to the high_commissioner for refugees médécins sans_frontières mother_teresa etc all show in addition the nobel_committee has awarded the peace_prize to the founder of the un food and agriculture organization fao john_boyd orr and to the man behind the green_revolution in agriculture norman borlaug so in principle this_year's peace_prize is less of a novelty than many appear to believe even granting that micro_credit as a tool for overcoming poverty is completely new in the context of the peace_prize sound common sense is not to be despised most people would probably agree that the fact that wealthy europe has been at peace in recent decades while there have been many conflicts in poverty stricken africa must have something to do with living conditions the causal connections are complicated everything can rarely if ever be attributed to a single factor we would nevertheless intuitively believe that there must be a connection between poverty and conflict but we do not have to rely solely on intuition in the summary of research on this subject in human security report 2005 we read that indeed one of the most striking findings to emerge from conflict research is that most wars take place in poor countries and that as per capita income increases the risk of war declines this is not to say that poor people are necessarily more violent than the more prosperous central government resources are also important the more prosperous a country is the more resources it has with which to resolve the problems that can give rise to conflict there is not just one way out of poverty there are many this year however the norwegian_nobel committee wants to draw_attention especially to micro_credit this instrument has produced good results in bangladesh over the past few_decades the country has recorded considerable economic_growth some of that growth is certainly due to the operations of grameen_bank and other institutions in the micro_credit field it will be important to increase the use of this instrument in the book banker to the poor the story of the grameen_bank yunus asks whether it is really possible to imagine a world without poverty his own answer is as follows we have created a slavery free world a polio free world an apartheid free world creating a poverty free world would be greater than all these accomplishments while at the same_time reinforcing them this would be a world that we could all be proud to live in around year 750 the chinese poet tu fu wrote in peter bilton's translation swarming cities are smithies for swords better forge a ploughshare forge a harrow where there now are tears and sand there would be silk and corn the widow would be a farmer's wife at her silk loom the soldier a farmer behind his ox and plough our silent people a choir in a song for two voices singing of silk and corn today the norwegian_nobel committee_wishes to express its admiration for the work muhammad_yunus and grameen_bank have done for thousands upon thousands of ordinary people in bangladesh and in many other countries we hope the peace_prize will be a source of inspiration in the continuing work for a world without poverty that is not a goal we shall reach in the next few_decades but we are on the way today we congratulate and celebrate the two of you muhammad_yunus and grameen_bank bangla apnader shobaikay ushno obhhindon warmest congratulations to you all tomorrow we shall hurry on together towards the goal of a world without poverty norwegian your_majesties your_royal highness laureates excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee's announcement on the 12th of october of this_year's peace_prize award opened with the following words the norwegian_nobel committee has decided that the nobel peace_prize for 2007 is to be shared in two equal parts between the intergovernmental panel on climate_change ipcc and albert arnold al_gore jr for their efforts to build_up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate_change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change i congratulate the ipcc and al_gore on this_year's peace_prize the oxford dictionary of contemporary world history describes the nobel peace_prize as the world's most prestigious prize the norwegian_nobel committee feels a heavy sense of responsibility in selecting a winner for such an honourable prize the steady increase in the number of nominees also makes the decision harder besides some controversy attaches to this_year's laureates nevertheless this_year's award decision was not especially difficult for it is rare for the world to be so concerned with a particular phenomenon or for that phenomenon to have such a decisive impact on our existence on earth this year a great_deal is hinging on global_warming processes that have been going on for a long time are accelerating the ice is melting more rapidly in the arctic the desert is spreading more quickly in africa the glaciers are shrinking in the himalayas in country after country climate related issues are moving up the political agenda the two who in the opinion of the nobel_committee should be given the greatest credit for this development are this_year's laureates the ipcc and al_gore the ipcc the united_nations climate panel is a unique body as its name alone indicates the climate panel was established in 1988 by the united_nations environment program unep and the world meteorological organization wmo this was a follow up on the so_called brundtland report our common future which had been submitted the year before and which gave rise to the first wave of discussion of the environment and the climate on a day like today gro harlem brundtland also deserves her share of the credit for the advances we have in fact made in our understanding of environmental problems whereas the brundtland report was wide ranging the ipcc was given a more delimited mandate the world's scientists were invited to participate in a continuous process aimed_at assessing global climate_change with regard to its degree causes and consequences and to counter measures currently over 130 countries are taking part with 450 authors and 800 contributors while 2,500 scientific experts take part in the hearings governments also take part in the reviews of the reports the climate panel is in other words a quite extraordinary global project the u.n climate panel has arrived at its conclusions through a form of work that is fundamentally innovative previous mobilizations of the scientific community have often had moral foundations for instance in the campaigns against nuclear_weapons or for human_rights in the case of the ipcc it is the united_nations and the nations of the world that have initiated a large scale and continuous mobilization of the scientific community's knowledge concerning climate_change similar procedures to the ipcc's should be considered as ways of approaching problems also in other fields biological diversity desertification and over fishing of the seas have been mentioned the ipcc's very first report presented in 1990 was to prove very influential principally in that it became one of the basic documents at the u.n conference on environment and climate in 1992 the second report in 1995 laid much of the foundation for the kyoto agreement of 1997 which has played such a significant part in the international debate on global_warming for the first time extensive and coordinated international steps were carried_out to counteract global_warming the third report in 2001 further consolidated the scientific base now we have just received the fourth report when the nobel days are over the laureates are travelling to bali to join the representatives of more_than 180 countries in preparing the ground for the agreement which is to replace the kyoto agreement with effect from 2012 we wish them good luck what happens or does_not happen at bali will determine our common future some say that the world's scientists do not all agree in their analyses of human induced global_warming things which all the world's scientists are fully agreed on are few and far between that is in the nature of research but there is little doubt about the main trends more and more scientists have reached ever closer agreement concerning the increasingly dramatic consequences that will follow from global_warming whereas in the 1980s global_warming might be viewed as an interesting hypothesis the 1990s produced firmer evidence of the real situation in the last few years the connections have become much clearer and the consequences still more apparent we thank the ipcc for its outstanding scientific work while the ipcc has laid the scientific foundations for our knowledge about climate_change al_gore is in the opinion of the norwegian_nobel committee the single individual who has done most to prepare the ground for the political action that is needed to counteract climate_change he is the great communicator he reaches people all over the world with his message as early as in the 1970s as a young member of the house of representatives al_gore organized hearings on emissions of greenhouse gases then seen as a relatively exotic subject many derogatory terms were applied to his commitment not least in the usa in 1992 gore published the book earth in the balance which wound up with a proposal for a global marshall plan to save the biosphere the book became a best seller in the usa it showed impressive insight built on a broad scientific platform and spoke in a distinctly political and activist tone of voice gore was into his stride as vice president al_gore signed the kyoto agreement but the senate opposed united_states ratification after his defeat in the presidential election in 2000 he laid the foundations for a completely new career as the world's leading political spokesman on the environment we know of all his achievements in the last few years from book film and concert to distinctions honour and prizes political defeats can also bring good results again and again gore has hammered in his message not least to americans the usa is along with china the great polluter but that also entails a responsibility for becoming the leader in emission reduction no one can charge gore with lacking concrete guidelines for what individuals can do an inconvenient truth contains sixteen tightly packed pages of advice on what you personally can do to help solve the climate crisis we all have a responsibility small countries and large all mankind but the heaviest responsibility rests on the rich nations which to a large_extent created global_warming behind gore's total commitment there is unquenchable optimism he watched the world take up arms against tobacco and achieve a high degree of success at least in many rich countries cancer took his sister's life where tobacco was concerned too strong interests had claimed that there was insufficient evidence no one is in any doubt any longer we thank al_gore for his great courage and unremitting struggle there was for a long time great doubt about whether global_warming was man made thanks to the ipcc there is very little such doubt today then there are those_who doubt that there is any connection between the environment and the climate on the one hand and war and conflict on the other why have the ipcc and al_gore been awarded a nobel prize for peace the norwegian_nobel committee has always had a broad approach to peace its opinion has been that there are many different paths to peace a number of these paths have been contentious not so much among ordinary people who are inclined to believe that any good cause deserves the peace_prize as among scholars whose task it is to study interrelations between phenomena when the nobel_committee handed out human_rights prizes scholars queried the connection between democracy and peace today they no_longer ask the connection is now regarded as among the most robust in modern political science the traditional concept of peace and security emphasises war between states in order to protect all the individuals of which states consist it is of course important to prevent any attack from outside but wars between states have become increasingly rare wars within states on the other_hand have grown more frequent many more people are killed today in civil wars than in wars between states those_who attach importance to human security argue that the main thing is to protect individuals the chief threats may be direct violence but deaths may also have less direct sources in starvation disease or natural disasters a goal in our modern world must be to maintain human security in the broadest sense environmental problems certainly affect human security in this broad sense when low lying areas are flooded their inhabitants will no_longer have any form of security in the words of last year's_laureate muhammad_yunus my country bangladesh is already paying a very high price for global_warming and stands to face even greater challenges in the future as natural calamities intensify year on year climate_change has already become a question of survival we can already see how millions of refugees from bangladesh are creating social and political tensions in india melting glaciers and rivers which first overflow and then have their rate of flow reduced or dry out mean dramatic changes in people's everyday lives in many places such events are coinciding with rapid increases in population such cities as quito la paz and lima are affected by the melting of glaciers in the andes the rivers from the glaciers in the himalayas supply half of the fresh water needed by 40 per_cent of the world's population desertification in china and africa is threatening vast land areas in some parts of the world global_warming can be beneficial we see farming being undertaken in northern regions where it has hitherto been difficult or impossible nevertheless inuit and sami people are worried sheila watt cloutier has said that this year it was planet earth that got the peace_prize the overall effect is negative in the south the picture is even clearer the effect will be particularly damaging for those_who are already in the greatest difficulty the weak states and vulnerable people who are least well equipped to meet the new challenges they are paying a high price for a problem largely brought about by the wealthy countries to the north unfortunately we can already establish that global_warming not only has negative consequences for human security but can also fuel violence and conflict within and between states it can be argued that the melt down in the arctic is giving a sharper edge to the new series of sovereignty claims that we are seeing in this northernmost part of the world the consequences are most obvious however among the poorest of the poor in darfur and in large sectors of the sahel belt where we have already had the first climate war the wind that blows the sand off the sahara sets people and camels moving towards more fertile areas the outcome is that nomads and peasants arabs and africans christians and muslims from many different tribes clash in a series of conflicts there are many dimensions to this but it is growing increasingly obvious that desertification is a central underlying factor the pattern from darfur has now spread to chad and the central african republic large parts of the sahel belt from the sudan to senegal are coming under threat it is not only the norwegian_nobel committee that sees interrelations between nature and the environment war and conflict so does the un security_council in april this year on britain's initiative the security_council held its first debate on the effect of climate on war and conflict the un secretary_general ban ki moon said in his careful way that when resources are scarce whether energy water or arable land our fragile ecosystems become strained as do the coping mechanisms of groups and individuals this can lead to a breakdown of established codes of conduct and even outright conflict climate and the environment have thus become one of the threats to international peace and security which the un security_council is meant to deal with a committee of prominent american military officers recently stated that climate changes are a threat multiplier for instability in some of the most volatile regions of the world the norwegian_nobel committee rarely raises its voice our style is largely sober but it is a long time since the committee was concerned with such fundamental questions as this year desmond_tutu peace_prize laureate in 1984 put it as follows in tromsø's arctic cathedral in connection with world environment day on the 5th of june to ignore the challenge of global_warming may be criminal it certainly is disobeying god it is sin the future of our fragile beautiful planet is in our hands we are stewards of god's creation we congratulate the ipcc and al_gore on receiving this_year's peace_prize we thank_you for what you have done for mother earth and wish you further success in a task that is so vital to us all action is needed now climate changes are already moving beyond human control thank_you for your attention norwegian your_majesties your_royal highness laureates excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee's announcement on the 10th of october of this_year's peace_prize award began as follows the norwegian_nobel committee has decided that the nobel peace_prize for 2008 to martti_ahtisaari for his important efforts on several continents and over more_than three decades to resolve international conflicts these efforts have contributed to a more peaceful world and to fraternity_between nations in alfred_nobel's spirit we congratulate martti_ahtisaari on this_year's peace_prize paljon onnea martti_ahtisaari the 10th of december is the most_important date in the nobel year on that day the prizes for medicine physics chemistry and literature are awarded in stockholm the economics prize in memory of alfred_nobel is also awarded there we salute each and every one of the laureates who will be receiving their awards in stockholm a little later today and the peace_prize as you see is awarded in oslo nobel laid_down in his will that it should be awarded by a committee of five persons to be elected by the norwegian_storting here we are up on the stage together with the committee's secretary nobel also decided that all the prizes should be awarded on the basis of achievements during the preceding year on that point i think all the committees must simply admit their failings the norwegian_nobel committee at any_rate has to declare that there was nothing so very special about 2008 that it could have led to the award of the nobel peace_prize to ahtisaari today for it is being awarded to him precisely for his important efforts on several continents and over more_than three decades it is not easy to take every sentence in nobel's will absolutely literally in norway we feel that we know ahtisaari well many norwegians have met him many of them are here_today he has had a long career as both a finnish and an international politician what is more he has norwegian roots his great grandfather was from tistedalen in the county of østfold i see that ahtisaari himself wondered in an interview whether it might be held against him that he was allegedly 12.5 per_cent norwegian it may well be that we have treated norwegian candidates especially restrictively in recent decades in 1921 and 1922 however the norwegian_nobel committee was bold enough awarding the prize first to christian lange and in the following year to fridtjof_nansen so two norwegians have received the peace_prize as against five swedes and one dane not until today has the prize gone to a finn but in that connection we have listened to alfred_nobel he urged that the worthiest candidate should receive the prize whether he be scandinavian or not martti_ahtisaari was born in viborg but during the winter war he moved with his mother to kuopio and later to uleåborg his father was at the front his experience in viborg then finland's second largest city which was incorporated into the soviet_union after the war and from which almost the entire finnish population moved explains my desire to advance peace and thus help others who have gone through similar experiences as i did as early as in 1960 when he was only 23 ahtisaari went to karachi in pakistan where for three years he was in charge of building up a ymca centre for physical education and teacher training this accustomed him to living in an international environment in 1965 after studying at the helsinki university of technology ahtisaari was recruited to the ministry for foreign_affairs his special interest there was development aid ahtisaari was to have nearly the whole world as his field of activity in 1973 he became finnish ambassador to tanzania in 1977 he was appointed united_nations commissioner for namibia as well as the secretary general's special representative for namibia namibia was to be for fourteen years the country to which he devoted his greatest efforts although in the same period he also undertook several different international and finnish assignments of his many achievements as a peace negotiator ahtisaari rates his work in namibia highest the mediation took such a long time there were so many players and dimensions involved the united_states and the soviet_union engaged themselves the cold_war made itself very much felt also in southern africa in the neighbouring country angola a civil war was fought in which both cuba and south_africa participated namibia was formally under un supervision but was in fact ruled by south_africa the independence movement swapo grew steadily stronger the peace process was stimulated by the end of the cold_war it also moved forward thanks to the emergence of a new white south_africa under f.w de_klerk but at the very centre of all this holding all the threads in his hand stood martti_ahtisaari he has been called namibia's midwife a midwife sometimes stands between life and death no single diplomat did more_than he did to deliver namibia's independence on the 21st of march 1990 after 24 years struggle today ahtisaari is an honorary citizen of the country many boys in namibia have been named after martti that must be at least as great an honour as being awarded the nobel peace_prize we thank ahtisaari for his work in namibia in namibia ahtisaari had a mandate from the united_nations for many years he was obliged to relate to many different parties at many different levels the situation in aceh was completely different there was a grave dispute over the status of aceh between the central government authorities in djakarta on the one hand and the free aceh movement gam on the other gam had been seeking independence since 1976 there had been bloody battles as it always does the civilian population suffered most from the conflict at least 15,000 people lost their lives one village became known as the widows town its men had either been killed or disappeared up into the mountains in 2003 a peace accord concluded the previous year had broken down everything appeared to be back where it started the parties had not spoken to one another for 20 months in that situation with his organization crisis management initiative cmi ahtisaari launched an initiative they had no international mandate they saw opportunities where others only saw conflict but they did think the work would take time as ahtisaari said when a married couple have not spoken to each_other for 20 months you can't expect love to bloom immediately love may not have bloomed but the negotiations made rapid progress in january 2005 ahtisaari and cmi brought the parties together in finland seven months later the government and gam signed a peace treaty in helsinki a natural disaster contributed to the solution the indescribable tsunami had hit aceh particularly hard at least 170,000 people died there for all its horror the disaster prepared the ground for peace but natural catastrophes do not necessarily pave the way to peace we saw that in sri lanka where developments took a wrong turning despite the tsunami someone had to bring the parties together someone had to provide a suitable context ahtisaari and cmi managed to get the parties to agree that aceh was to be part of indonesia but with extensive autonomy gam would hand in their weapons and be transformed into a political party the process has gone surprisingly well although challenges remain an election is to be held in april 2009 president susilo bambang yudhoyono of indonesia has called ahtisaari the master of peace we thank ahtisaari for the solution in aceh the balkans are the third region in which ahtisaari's mediation has produced significant results in bosnia hercegovina he worked as a mediator for the united_nations in 1999 he contributed together with russia's prime_minister viktor chernomyrdin to bringing the war over kosovo to an end it was the two of them between them who got slobodan milosevic to stop the war ahtisaari is not one to boast about his achievements concerning kosovo he has said in an interview that chernomyrdin and he did not negotiate with milosevic we simply presented an offer which would make it easier to put a stop to the bombing provided he committed the yugoslav government to certain principles no one can solve every international problem sometimes the parties are too far apart in such cases we have to be satisfied if the matter is brought just a few steps closer to a solution for the past few years ahtisaari has striven hard to find a lasting solution for kosovo in november 2005 he was appointed special envoy of the united_nations secretary_general for the future status of kosovo this was a difficult task the parties were very far apart divided by centuries of bitter history the last twenty_years had seen a more or less continuous crisis serbia was fundamentally opposed to independence for kosovo there was nothing the kosovo albanians eventually accounting for over 90 per_cent of the population for their part wanted more in aceh a compromise was found in kosovo no compromise was possible in january 2007 ahtisaari put_forward his proposal for a solution kosovo would become virtually independent subject only to some international supervision the serbs in kosovo would be granted considerable autonomy and have the right to maintain certain ties with serbia the proposal met with massive opposition in serbia the kosovo albanians were just as strongly in favour ahtisaari's proposed solution was never adopted by the un security_council russia with her close links to serbia was against it in july 2007 ahtisaari declared his mission over further negotiations inspired by the usa the eu and russia failed to produce a solution that both parties could accept so on the 17th of february 2008 the kosovo albanians declared kosovo independent the new state was quickly recognised by the usa and most eu countries and today over fifty countries have taken the same step on the 10th of october ahtisaari heard that macedonia and montenegro had recognised kosovo then he got the phone call about the nobel peace_prize it must have been a good day serbia with russia's support still objects to the new state it can nevertheless be said that ahtisaari's solution for kosovo has to a large_extent been put into_practice kosovo has become independent the conflict had no other solution there are however many signs that the serbian minority will be more or less integrated with serbia contrary to ahtisaari's plan we thank ahtisaari for his work to solve the kosovo conflict the scale and scope of ahtisaari's activities are almost beyond belief his greatest achievements have been mentioned they are linked to namibia aceh and kosovo but he has also made important contributions to peace and reconciliation in northern_ireland in central asia and on the horn of africa in addition to all this he has managed to serve for six years as finland's president during his term from 1994 to 2000 finland's economy underwent significant improvement finland joined the european union boris yeltsin and bill clinton met in helsinki but with the finnish political establishment in attendance here in the oslo city hall we must take care not to give ahtisaari too much of the credit for these developments in 2008 ahtisaari and crisis management initiative have been involved in negotiations concerning peace in iraq in april in helsinki in cooperation with several american institutions and with ahtisaari as senior adviser cmi induced 36 iraqi politicians to agree on a declaration in principle on peace in iraq the declaration stated that dialogue and negotiations must be the most_important keys to solving the country's problems facilitators as they are called from northern_ireland and south_africa are also engaged in this work cmi and ahtisaari are continuing to lend a hand in the ongoing process the norwegian_nobel committee has often awarded the nobel peace_prize to the parties in a conflict it is the parties and their representatives who take the personal and political risk of entering into peace agreements but mediators too face major challenges and the parties in a conflict nearly always need help in reaching their objectives the norwegian_nobel committee has honoured mediators from theodore roosevelt in 1906 to kofi_annan in 2001 and jimmy_carter in 2002 ahtisaari is in other words one of an exclusive group of peace negotiators who have made decisive contributions to peace and reconciliation in the world his efforts have been untiring and he has achieved good results ahtisaari has shown what parts mediators of many different kinds can play in the resolution of even the most difficult international conflicts mediators no_doubt differ as widely as most people ahtisaari has for his part said i have learned that you do not achieve peace just by saying nice things to the parties you have to be sincere you have to have the courage to tell people that they are acting counter productively i_am sincere i_am not always amiable this may not sound too difficult in aceh he asked the parties head on do you want to win the war or do you want peace optimism is important in mediation efforts ahtisaari believes every conflict can be resolved every that's optimism for you having finnish sisu must have been a great help so must the support of his wife eeva the ability to listen and to go straight to the core of problems is decisive it has often been said moreover that you achieve most if you are not too busy winning credit for yourself that need not prevent one from afterwards receiving the nobel peace_prize only very few of us can become peace mediators at a high international level but we can all be peace mediators at a national or local level in the neighbourhood at schools or in families in this respect universities and schools can make valuable contributions ahtisaari has put it as follows we must all look in the mirror and ask ourselves have i done my best for peace i usually wind up my nobel addresses with literary quotations this year the writer has to be finnish the words were written in 1926 by frans eemil sillanpää in 1939 he was awarded the nobel prize for literature the only finn to have won it the translation from finnish to norwegian is by jan erik kaplon and from norwegian to english by peter bilton i read it as a greeting from finland's only literature laureate to the country's first peace_prize laureate at bottom all humanity shares a common fate our distress is common we must therefore honour the efforts every human being makes to alleviate and remove our common distress every war is a disgrace to those_who wage it and to the whole of mankind war always ends in misery man only does his good_deeds in times of peace only then are we able to prevent distress whoever builds peace builds humanity se joka rakentaa rauhaa rakentaa ihmisyyttä we congratulate martti_ahtisaari on the nobel peace_prize

mr_president and nobel peace_prize laureate your_royal highnesses excellencies_ladies and gentlemen on the 9th of october this year the norwegian_nobel committee announced that the nobel peace_prize for 2009 was to be awarded to president barack h obama for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples the committee has attached special importance to obama's vision of and work for a world free from nuclear_weapons commenting on the award president_obama said he did not feel that he deserved to be in the company of so many transformative figures that have been honoured by this prize and whose courageous pursuit of peace has inspired the world but he added that he also knew that the nobel prize had not just been used to honor specific achievements but also to give momentum to a set of causes the prize could thus represent a call to action president_obama has understood the norwegian_nobel committee perfectly we congratulate him on this_year's nobel peace_prize this_year's award must be viewed in the light of the prevailing situation in the world with great tension numerous wars unresolved conflicts and confrontation on many fronts around the world and not least there is the imminent danger of the spread of nuclear_weapons degradation of the environment and global_warming in fact time magazine recently described the decade that is coming to an end as the worst since the end of world war ii from the very first moment of his presidency president_obama has been trying to create a more cooperative climate which can help reverse the present trend he has already lowered the temperature in the world in the words of former peace_prize laureate desmond_tutu the committee always takes alfred_nobel's will as its frame of reference we are to award the nobel peace_prize to the person who during the preceding year meaning in this case since the previous award in december 2008 shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity_between nations for the abolition_or reduction of standing_armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses to quote from the will the question was actually quite simple who has done most for peace in the past year if the question is put in nobel's terms the answer is relatively easy to find it had to be u.s_president barack obama only rarely does one person dominate international politics to the same extent as obama or in such a short space of time initiate so many and such major changes as obama has done the question for the committee was rather whether it would be bold enough to single out the most powerful man in the world with the responsibility and the obligations that come with the office of the president of the united_states the committee came to the conclusion that it must still be possible to award the nobel peace_prize to a political leader we cannot get the world on a safer track without political leadership and time is short many have argued that the prize comes too early but history can tell us a great_deal about lost opportunities it is now today that we have the opportunity to support president obama's ideas this_year's prize is indeed a call to action to all of us the committee knows that many will weigh his ideals against what he really does and that should be welcomed but if the demand is either to fulfil your ideals to the letter and at once or to stop having ideals we are left with a most damaging division between the limits of today's realities and the vision for tomorrow then politics becomes pure cynicism political leaders must be able to think beyond the often narrow confines of realpolitik only in this way can we move the world in the right direction obama has achieved a great_deal multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position with emphasis on the role that the united_nations and other international institutions can play former secretary_general dag_hammarskjöld said that the u.n was not created to take humanity to heaven but to save it from hell the u.s.a is now paying its bills to the u.n it is joining various committees and acceding to important conventions international standards are again respected torture is forbidden the president is doing what he can to close guantanamo human_rights and international_law are guiding principles this is why this_year's laureate has earned the praise of the leaders of international institutions new opportunities have been created your_majesties mr_president your_royal highnesses_ladies and gentlemen the vision of a world free from nuclear_weapons has powerfully stimulated disarmament and arms_control negotiations under obama's leadership the u.n security_council gave its unanimous support to the vision of a world without nuclear_weapons the new administration in washington has reconsidered the deployment in eastern_europe of the planned anti missile defences and is instead looking at other multilateral options to secure the region this has contributed to an improved atmosphere in the negotiations on strategic nuclear_weapons between the u.s.a and the russian federation a new agreement between them will we hope soon be on the table we can see how the vision of a world without nuclear_weapons is encouraging even the smaller nuclear powers to make cuts and we can certainly not prevent the spread of nuclear_arms to new countries unless the established nuclear powers meet their obligations that was the clear premise underlying the non_proliferation treaty and it still applies today the important non_proliferation treaty review conference is being held next year either the nuclear powers will clearly signal their willingness to disarm or the conference may prove a fiasco with the danger of a new arms_race president_obama has sent his signal in today's washington dialogue and negotiations are the preferred instruments for resolving even the most difficult international conflicts the united_states is no_longer on the sidelines regarding the nuclear program in iran as the president put it in his inaugural address we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist there is no guarantee that negotiations always succeed but in obama's opinion the u.s.a is obliged to try if the outstretched_hand continues to meet a clenched fist the global community will then stand more united in its further response obama has insisted that the u.s.a has to build coalitions and make friends rather_than to create enemies he is pursuing this strategy also in afghanistan the struggle_against violent extremism in afghanistan rests on broad international foundations and is supported actively by many governments around the world in the long_run however the problems in afghanistan can be solved only by the afghans themselves this is also the basic logic behind the president's new strategy there regarding the fight_against climate_change we can see the same underlying idea the u.s.a cannot be indifferent to global challenges while it cannot solve such challenges alone they cannot be met without the u.s.a obama has presented concrete proposals for what the u.s.a will do this has improved chances of reaching an effective global agreement if not this year then we hope at least next year china is steadily moving to the forefront of international politics and the global economy there has been a sense in america that many of the greatest challenges can only be met in close cooperation with the people's republic of china for instance no country has polluted more_than the u.s.a and no country will pollute more_than china in the future the economies of the two countries are closely intertwined the rise of new great_powers often leads to war and conflict there are those in america who fear that history may repeat itself in that respect the obama administration's cooperation with beijing means that we have little reason to fear such a repetition obama's diplomacy rests on the idea that whoever is to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world's population that was how they put it those earlier american presidents who above_all others were seen as world leaders also outside the united_states woodrow_wilson and franklin d roosevelt john f kennedy and ronald reagan america's ideals were the world's ideals they lived in reagan's words not only in the hearts and minds of our countrymen but in the hearts and minds of millions of the world's people in both free and oppressed societies who look to us for leadership obama's ideals coincide to a large_extent with the ideals that have underpinned the activities of the norwegian_nobel committee throughout our 108 year history to strengthen international institutions as much as possible to advance democracy and human_rights to reduce the importance of arms and preferably do away with nuclear_arms altogether to promote dialogue and negotiations and in the last few years to adopt effective measures to meet the climate threat looking at the history of the nobel prize we can see several examples of awards to persons or institutions that have achieved fundamental agreements or other results which have stood the test of history we will find at least as many awards that have gone to those_who tried to bring_about fundamental changes in international politics but where the results were still unclear at the time when they received their awards woodrow wilson's prize came when he was at his weakest both politically and personally after suffering a stroke he had created the league of nations but the united_states would not join wilson was a hero to the world but not in the u.s.a the american secretary of state cordell_hull received the award after the establishment of the united_nations but so early that no one could be sure how significant the u.n would be many have been awarded the peace_prize for their courage even when the results for a long time seemed modest carl_von ossietzky andrej sakharov lech_walesa and the dalai_lama to name a few when albert_lutuli received his peace_prize the struggle_against apartheid was in its infancy there were few results to point to when martin_luther king jr received his award he had proclaimed his dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character but there was still a long way to go from dream to reality mr_president we are happy to see that through your presence here so much of dr king's dream has come true in the middle_east there have been many wars and many peace prizes have been awarded why does the nobel_committee not wait until final peace agreements have been concluded nothing is final in history it always moves on peace must be built again and again the norwegian_nobel committee can not award a peace_prize where nothing has been achieved if the principles are important enough however and the struggle over them is vital to the future of the world the committee can not wait until we are certain that the principles have won on all fronts that would make the prize a rather belated stamp of approval and not an instrument for peace in the world your_majesties mr_president your_royal highnesses_ladies and gentlemen mr_president in both the first and the second_world war your great country came to europe's rescue we will never forget that after the first world war woodrow_wilson sought to build a world founded on international cooperation and democracy his success was limited during and after the second_world war franklin roosevelt and harry truman took initiatives to create the united_nations and other global institutions their creation still lives on today the lesson was that the power of nation states could not be unlimited states must commit_themselves to international_law and universal rights the world moved away from unrestrained nation states and towards greater internationalism today yet another american president is trying to renew internationalism he reaffirms that the u.s.a must lead together with others walls must be torn down as he put it in his speech in berlin in july 2008 the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic cannot stand the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand the walls between races and tribes natives and immigrants christians and muslims and jews cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down this must surely be nobel's fraternity_between nations your_majesties mr_president your_royal highnesses_ladies and gentlemen president_obama is a political leader who understands that even the mightiest are vulnerable when they stand alone he is a man who believes in the strength of a community be it the local community where he started his career many years_ago or the global community which he leads today obama has the audacity to hope and the tenacity to make these hopes come true this is what makes him so important by his own behaviour and leadership he is demanding that we all take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges we congratulate this_year's laureate president barack h obama on what he has already achieved and wish him every possible success in his continuing efforts for a more peaceful world may you receive the help you truly deserve your_majesties excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has decided to award the nobel peace_prize for 2010 to liu xiaobo for his long and non violent struggle for fundamental human_rights in china the norwegian_nobel committee has long believed that there is a close connection between human_rights and peace such rights are a prerequisite for the fraternity_between nations of which alfred_nobel wrote in his will this was the first paragraph of the norwegian_nobel committee's announcement on the 8th of october of the award of this_year's peace_prize we regret that the laureate is not present here_today he is in isolation in a prison in north east china nor can the laureate's wife liu xia or his closest relatives be here with us no medal or diploma will therefore be presented here_today this fact alone shows that the award was necessary and appropriate we congratulate liu xiaobo on this_year's peace_prize there have been a number of previous occasions when the laureate has been prevented from attending this has in fact been the case with several awards which have proved in the light of history to have been most significant and honourable even when the laureate has come he or she has several times been severely condemned by the authorities of his or her own_country there was a great_deal of trouble in 1935 when the committee gave the award to carl_von ossietzky hitler was furious and prohibited all germans from accepting any nobel prize king haakon did not attend the ceremony ossietzky did not come to oslo and died a little over a year later there was considerable outrage in moscow when andrej sakharov received his prize in 1975 he too was prevented from receiving the award in person he sent his wife the same thing happened to lech_walesa in 1983 the burmese authorities were furious when aung_san suu_kyi received the peace_prize in 1991 once_again the laureate could not come to oslo in 2003 shirin_ebadi received the nobel peace_prize she came much could be said of the reaction of the iranian authorities but the iranian ambassador did in fact attend the ceremony the norwegian_nobel committee has given four prizes to south_africa all the laureates came to oslo but the awards to albert_lutuli in 1960 and to desmond_tutu in 1984 provoked great outrage in the apartheid_regime in south_africa before the applause broke_out thanks to the awards to nelson_mandela and f.w de_klerk in 1993 the point of these awards has of course never been to offend anyone the nobel_committee's intention has been to say something about the relationship_between human_rights democracy and peace and it has been important to remind the world that the rights so widely enjoyed today were fought for and won by persons who took great risks they did so for others that is why liu xiaobo deserves our support although none of the committee's members have ever met liu we feel that we know him we have studied him closely over a long period of time liu was born on the 28th of december 1955 in changchun in china's jilin province he took a bachelor's degree in literature at jilin university and a master's degree and a phd at beijing normal university where he also taught stays abroad included visits to oslo hawaii and columbia university new_york in 1989 he returned home to take part in the dawning democracy movement on the 2nd of june he and some friends started a hunger strike on tiananmen square to protest_against the state of emergency that had been declared they issued a six point democratic manifesto written by liu opposing dictatorship and in favour of democracy liu was opposed to any physical struggle_against the authorities on the part of the students he tried to find a peaceful_solution to the tension between the students and the government non_violence was already figuring prominently in his message on the 4th of june he and his friends tried to prevent a clash between the army and the students he was only partially successful many lives were lost most of them outside tiananmen square liu has told his wife that he would like this_year's peace_prize to be dedicated to the lost souls from the 4th of june it is a pleasure for us to fulfil his wish liu has said that the greatness of non violent resistance is that even as man is faced with forceful tyranny and the resulting suffering the victim responds to hate with love to prejudice with tolerance to arrogance with humility to humiliation with dignity and to violence with reason tiananmen became a turning point in liu's life in 1996 liu was sentenced to three years in a labour camp for rumour mongering and slander he was president of the independent chinese pen centre from 2003 to 2007 liu has written nearly 800 essays 499 of them since 2005 he was one of the chief architects behind charter 08 which was made known on the 10th of december 2008 which was in the words of the document's preamble on the occasion of the one hundredth anniversary of china's first constitution the 60th anniversary of the promulgation of the universal_declaration of human_rights the 30th anniversary of the birth of the democracy wall and the 10th anniversary of the chinese government's signature of the international covenant on civil and political rights charter 08 defends fundamental human_rights and has in due course been signed by several thousand persons both in china itself and abroad on the 25th of december 2009 liu was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment and two years loss of political rights for in the words of the sentence incitement to the overthrow of the state power and socialist system and the people's democratic dictatorship liu has consistently claimed that the sentence violates both china's own constitution and fundamental human_rights there are many dissidents in china and their opinions differ on many points the severe punishment imposed on liu made him more_than a central spokesman for human_rights practically overnight he became the very symbol both in china and internationally of the struggle for such rights in china your_majesties ladies and gentlemen during the cold_war the connections between peace and human_rights were disputed since the end of the cold_war however peace researchers and political scientists have almost without exception underlined how close those connections are this is allegedly one of the most robust findings they have arrived at democracies may go to war against dictatorships and have certainly waged colonial wars but there is apparently not a single example of a democracy having gone to war against another democracy the deeper fraternity_between nations which alfred_nobel mentions in his will and which is a prerequisite for real peace can hardly be created without human_rights and democracy there are scarcely any examples in world history of a great power achieving such rapid growth over such a long period of time as china since 1978 year by year decade after decade the country's growth rate has stood at 10 percent or more a few years_ago the country's output was greater than germany's this year it exceeded japan's china has thus achieved the world's second largest gross national product the usa's national product is still three times greater than china's but while china is continuing its advance the usa is in serious difficulties economic success has lifted several_hundred million chinese out of poverty for the reduction in the number of poor people in the world china must be given the main credit we can to a certain degree say that china with its 1.3 billion people is carrying mankind's fate on its shoulders if the country proves capable of developing a social market economy with full civil rights this will have a huge favourable impact on the world if not there is a danger of social and economic crises arising in the country with negative consequences for us all historical experience gives us reason to believe that continuing rapid economic_growth presupposes opportunities for free research thinking and debate and moreover without freedom of expression corruption the abuse of power and misrule will develop every power system must be counterbalanced by popularly elected control free media and the right of individual citizens to criticise more or less authoritarian states may have long periods of rapid economic_growth but it is no coincidence that nearly all the richest countries in the world are democratic democracy mobilises new human and technological resources china's new status entails increased responsibility china must be prepared for criticism and regard it as positive as an opportunity for improvement this must be the case wherever there is great power we have all formed opinions on the role of the usa through the years friends and allies criticised the country both for the vietnam war and for the lack of civil rights for the coloured people many americans were opposed to the award of the nobel peace_prize to martin_luther king in 1964 looking back we can see that the usa grew stronger when the african american people obtained their rights many will ask whether china's weakness for all the strength the country is currently showing is not manifested in the need to imprison a man for eleven years merely for expressing his opinions on how his country should be governed this weakness finds clear expression in the sentence on liu where it is underlined as especially serious that he spread his opinions on the internet but those_who fear technological advances have every reason to fear the future information technology can not be abolished it will continue to open societies as russia's president dmitrij medvedev put it in an address to the duma the new information technology gives us an opportunity to become connected with the world the world and society are growing more open even if the ruling class does_not like it no_doubt medvedev had the fate of the soviet_union in mind compulsory uniformity and control of thought prevented the country from participating in the technological revolution which took_place in the 1970s and 80s the system broke down the country would have stood to gain a great_deal more from entering into a dialogue at an early stage with people like andrej sakharov your_majesties ladies and gentlemen today neither the nation state nor a majority within the nation state has unlimited authority human_rights limit what the nation state and the majority in a nation state can do this must apply to all states that are members of the united_nations and who have acceded to the universal_declaration of human_rights china has signed and even ratified several of the un's and the ilo's major international conventions on human_rights it is interesting that china has accepted the supranational conflict resolving mechanism of the wto china's own constitution upholds fundamental human_rights article 35 of the country's constitution thus lays down that citizens of the people's republic of china enjoy freedom of speech of the press of assembly of association of procession and of demonstration article 41 begins by stating that citizens have the right to criticise and make suggestions regarding any state organ or functionary liu has exercised his civil rights he has done nothing wrong he must therefore be released in the past 100 to 150 years human_rights and democracy have gained an ever stronger position in the world and with them peace this can be clearly seen in europe where so many wars were fought and whose colonial powers started so many wars around the world europe today is on the whole a continent of peace decolonization after the second_world war gave a number of countries first in asia and then in africa the chance to govern themselves with respect for basic human_rights with india in the lead many of them seized the opportunity over the latest decades we have seen how democracy has consolidated its position in latin_america and in central and eastern_europe many countries in the muslim part of the world are treading the same path turkey indonesia malaysia several other countries are in the process of opening up their political systems the human_rights activists in china are defenders of the international order and the main trends in the global community viewed in that light they are thus not dissidents but representatives of the main lines of development in today's world liu denies that criticism of the communist_party is the same as offending china and the chinese people he argues that even if the communist_party is the ruling party it cannot be equated with the country let alone with the nation and its culture changes in china can take time a very long time political reforms should as liu says be gradual peaceful orderly and controlled china has had enough of attempts at revolutionary change they only lead to chaos but as liu also writes an enormous transformation towards pluralism in society has already taken_place and official authority is no_longer able to fully control the whole society however strong the power of the regime may appear to be every_single individual must do his best to live in his words an honest life with dignity the answer from the chinese authorities is to claim that this_year's peace_prize humiliates china and to give very derogatory descriptions of liu history shows many examples of political leaders playing on nationalist feelings and attempting to demonize holders of contrary opinions they soon become foreign agents this has sometimes happened in the name of democracy and freedom but almost always with a tragic outcome we recognise this in the rhetoric of the struggle_against terrorism you are either for me or against me such undemocratic methods as torture and imprisonment without sentence have been used in the name of freedom this has led to more polarisation of the world and harmed the fight_against terrorism liu xiaobo is an optimist despite his many years in prison in his closing appeal to the court on the 23rd of december 2009 he said i filled with optimism look forward to the advent of a future free china for there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law where human_rights reign supreme isaac newton once said if i have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants when we are able to look ahead today it is because we are standing on the shoulders of the many men and women who over the years often at great risk have stood up for what they believed in and thus made our freedom possible therefore while others at this time are counting their money focussing exclusively on their short term national interests or remaining indifferent the norwegian_nobel committee has once_again chosen to support those_who fight for us all we congratulate liu xiaobo on the nobel peace_prize for 2010 his views will in the long_run strengthen china we extend to him and to china our very best wishes for the years ahead your_majesties your_royal highnesses laureates excellencies_ladies and gentlemen ellen johnson sirleaf leymah gbowee and tawakkol karman ever_since the norwegian_nobel committee made this_year's decision known the people of norway have looked forward to seeing you on this stage all those with empathy for children and women who are ill treated and killed all those_who believe in a future free from violence and war will acclaim you today out of respect for the will to act that you represent you give concrete meaning to the chinese proverb which says that women hold up half the sky that was why when giving its reasons for this_year's award the nobel_committee stated that we cannot achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women acquire the same opportunities as men to influence developments at all levels of society we thank_you for the hope you awaken in us all and we congratulate you on this_year's peace_prize men and women have at all times experienced war in different ways although women too have fought in wars through the centuries and today even engage in terrorism it is the men who to a far greater extent have engaged in the actual warfare in modern wars the majority of the victims are often civilian and very many of them are women and children rape has always been one of the horrors of war but in recent_years in bosnia herzegovina in darfur in rwanda and in congo among many other places we have seen rape working not just as a massive violation in itself rape has become part of the tactics of war the aim is to break down the enemy's morale to force populations to move and to punish opponents also after the war is over this was defined as a crime against humanity and as war crimes by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia the international criminal court icc has since reached the same conclusion popular opinion in favour of this view must be strengthened and that is what we are doing here_today we are doing so by attracting renewed attention to the resolution adopted in october 2000 by the un security_council resolution 1325 the resolution for the first time made violence against women in wartime an international security issue it underlined the need to have women become participants on an equal footing with men in peace processes and in peace work in general women had to break_out of their roles as victims they must themselves become players who will contribute to creating peace these goals were then hammered out further in four new security_council resolutions 1820 1888 1889 and 1960 these resolutions must be given prominent and visible places on the desks of all heads of state for there is still a long way to go before the goals of these resolutions are reached in recent peace negotiations in various parts of the world which are surveyed fewer than 8 per_cent of the participants in the negotiations and fewer than 3 per_cent of the peace agreement signatories were women no woman has ever been appointed chief negotiator in any peace negotiations led by the un meanwhile the rapes continue thousands of them day after day the situation of women is difficult in many parts of the world when a little progress is made it is often men who benefit most a brief illustration bicycles have in recent_years made their entry in rural districts in many poor countries the women who often both till the soil carry goods to market and see that the children get to school rarely get to use the bicycle it is for the male member of the family far too often he uses it to visit the local bar and now he can also get to the bars in the neighbouring villages as so many have pointed_out help for women is help for the family help for men is unfortunately far too often only help to them alone investment in girls education is probably the best investment any developing country can make but luckily women are not only victims some take action three of them are today receiving the nobel peace_prize for 2011 ellen johnson sirleaf's whole life can be seen as a realization of the intentions of resolution 1325 in 1980 she went into exile after having been imprisoned and threatened with rape for several years she served as director of the undp's regional bureau for africa she was one of seven eminent persons who investigated the genocide in rwanda on_behalf of the organization of african unity oau when the civil war_broke out in liberia in 1989 johnson sirleaf first supported charles taylor in the hope that he might represent a solution but gradually dissociated herself from him and ran against taylor unsuccessfully in the presidential election in 1997 in the election in 2005 however johnson sirleaf won a convincing victory which made her the first democratically elected female head of state on the african continent liberia remains one of the poorest countries in the world and faces huge problems but much progress has nevertheless been made since johnson sirleaf was installed as president in 2006 the civil war is over democracy is working there has been considerable economic_growth the very widespread corruption has been somewhat reduced women's education and participation in social life has been significantly strengthened the monstrous number of rapes has diminished few other persons better satisfy the criteria for receiving the peace_prize mentioned in alfred_nobel's will congratulations the same applies to leymah gbowee she is the trauma specialist who switched from treating war victims to working for peace in 2002 she mobilized a network of over 2,000 women in 15 provinces in liberia to protest_against the war and the violence they dressed in white and took their stand near monrovia's fish market it was very important that gbowee managed to unite women with quite different religious and ethnic backgrounds in this struggle during the peace negotiations in ghana the women in frustration shut the male negotiators in and threatened to strip themselves naked something which in that country would have brought utter disgrace on the men as we know they were able to keep their clothes on a peace agreement was reached gbowee's work inspired many women to engage in a non violent struggle_against war and violence and for women's rights as a network builder she took the initiative in forming the women in peacebuilding network wipnet which focused not only on liberia but also on other parts of west africa gbowee currently heads the women peace and security network africa wipsen headquartered in accra in ghana we hope this_year's prize will help to strengthen this network congratulations yemen is the country in the world which has made the least progress where women's rights are concerned in her home peace_prize laureate tawakkol karman keeps pictures of her heroes mahatma_gandhi martin_luther king nelson_mandela and hillary clinton many years before the arab spring in 2011 she was a youth and female activist she became a journalist and founded the organization women journalists without chains she organized peaceful sit ins and information campaigns she trained other women to take part in this struggle in a country where the vast majority of women wear niqabs tawakkol karman changed to the hijab she is at the same_time a member of an islamic party in 2011 she was one of the leaders of the demonstrations on change square in sana she was imprisoned and exposed to serious threats but nothing stopped her day in and day out she has campaigned against president ali abdullah saleh and for democracy women's rights and tolerance she advocates understanding between shias and sunnis and between islam and other religions the promising arab spring will become a new winter if women are again left out the visible as well as the invisible and indirect violence to them must cease women must be fully accepted in all sectors of community life in her own way of life and struggle karman has shown that islam presents no obstacle to this on the contrary islam must be part of the solution only then will there be democracy and peaceful development in this part of the world that will mean greater security for all of us what karman has achieved in a short space of time is incredible as a 32 year old she is the youngest laureate in the history of the peace_prize her struggle is our struggle congratulations and good luck for the future the leaders in yemen and syria who murder their people to retain their own power should take note of the following mankind's fight for freedom and human_rights never stops no dictator can in the long_run find shelter from this wind of history it was this wind which led people to crawl up onto the berlin wall and tear it down it is the wind that is now blowing in the arab world not even president saleh was able and president assad in syria will not be able to resist the people's demand for freedom and human_rights as we have with us today two strong women from liberia the country that was built by slaves who had the opportunity to return to africa and since we have an equally strong woman from a country yemen where the women are at present demanding freedom i shall conclude with a quotation from the american author and civil rights advocate james baldwin who wrote the people that once walked in darkness are no_longer prepared to do so make a note of that all those_who wish to be on the right side of history we congratulate this_year's winners of the nobel peace_prize you represent one of the most_important motive forces for change in today's world the struggle for human_rights in general and the struggle of women for equality and peace in particular thank_you for your attention your_majesties your_royal highnesses heads of state heads of government excellencies_ladies and gentlemen honourable presidents of the european union at a time when europe is undergoing great difficulties the norwegian_nobel committee has sought to call to mind what the european union means for peace in europe after the two world wars in the last century the world had to turn away from nationalism and move in the direction of international cooperation the united_nations were formed the universal_declaration of human_rights was adopted for europe where both world wars had broken out the new internationalism had to be a binding commitment it had to build on human_rights democracy and enforceable principles of the rule of law and on economic cooperation aimed_at making the countries equal partners in the european marketplace by these means the countries would be bound together so as to make new wars impossible the coal and steel community of 1951 marked the start of a process of reconciliation which has continued right to the present day beginning in western europe the process continued across the east west divide when the berlin wall fell and has currently reached the balkans where there were bloody wars less_than 15 to 20 years_ago the eu has constantly been a central driving_force throughout these processes of reconciliation the eu has in fact helped to bring_about both the fraternity_between nations and the promotion of peace congresses of which alfred_nobel wrote in his will the nobel peace_prize is therefore both deserved and necessary we offer our congratulations in the light of the financial crisis that is affecting so many innocent people we can see that the political framework in which the union is rooted is more important now than ever we must stand together we have collective responsibility without this european cooperation the result might easily have been new protectionism new nationalism with the risk that the ground gained would be lost we know from the inter war years that this is what can happen when ordinary people pay the bills for a financial crisis triggered by others but the solution now as then is not for the countries to act on their own at the expense of others nor for vulnerable minorities to be given the blame that would lead us into yesterday's traps europe needs to move forward safeguard what has been gained and improve what has been created enabling us to solve the problems threatening the european community today this is the only way to solve the problems created by the financial crisis to everyone's benefit in 1926 the norwegian_nobel committee awarded the peace_prize to the foreign ministers of france and germany aristide_briand and gustav stresemann and the following year to ferdinand buisson and ludwig quidde all for their efforts to advance franco german reconciliation in the 1930s the reconciliation degenerated into conflict and war after the second_world war the reconciliation between germany and france laid the very foundations for european integration the two countries had waged three wars in the space of 70 years the franco prussian war in 1870 71 then the first and second_world wars in the first years after 1945 it was very tempting to continue along the same track emphasizing revenge and conflict then on the 9th of may 1950 the french foreign_minister robert schuman presented the plans for a coal and steel community the governments in paris and bonn decided to set history on a completely different course by placing the production of coal and steel under a joint authority the principal elements of armaments production were to form the beams of a structure for peace economic cooperation would from then on prevent new wars and conflicts in europe as schuman put it in his 9th of may speech the solidarity in production thus established will make it plain that any war between france and germany becomes not merely unthinkable but materially impossible the reconciliation between germany and france is probably the most dramatic example in history to show that war and conflict can be turned so rapidly into peace and cooperation the presence here_today of german chancellor angela merkel and french president françois hollande makes this day particularly symbolic the next step after the coal and steel community was the signing of the treaty of rome on the 25th of march 1957 the four freedoms were now established borders were to be opened and the whole economy not just the coal and steel industry was to be woven into a whole the six heads of state of germany france italy the netherlands belgium and luxembourg wrote that they by thus pooling their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty and calling upon the other peoples of europe who share their ideal to join in their efforts have decided to create a european economic community in 1973 great_britain ireland and denmark decided to respond to this call greece joined in 1981 and spain and portugal in 1986 membership of the eec and eu was the right of all european countries whose system of government is founded on the principles of democracy and who accept the conditions for membership membership consolidated democracy in these countries not least through the generous support schemes from which greece portugal and spain were able to benefit the next step forward came when the berlin wall fell in the course of a miraculous half year in 1989 opportunities opened up for the neutral countries sweden finland and austria to become members but the new democracies too wished to become parts of the west militarily economically and culturally in that connection membership of the eu was a self_evident objective and a means enabling the transition to democracy to be made as painlessly as possible if they were left to themselves nobody could be certain how things would turn out for history has taught_us freedom comes at a price the difference is very marked between what happened after the fall of the berlin wall and what is now happening in the countries of the arab world the eastern european countries were quickly able to participate in a european community of values join in a large market and benefit from economic support the new democracies in the vicinity of europe have no such safe haven to make for the transition to democracy also looks like being long and painful and has already triggered war and conflict in europe the division between east and west was broken down more quickly than anyone could have anticipated democracy has been strengthened in a region where democratic traditions were very limited the many disputes over ethnicity and nationality that had so troubled the region have largely been settled mikhail_gorbachev created the external conditions for the emancipation of eastern_europe and national leaders headed by lech_walesa took the necessary local initiatives both walesa and gorbachev received their well deserved peace prizes now at last it is the eu's turn events during the months and years following the fall of the berlin wall may have amounted to the greatest act of solidarity ever on the european continent this collective effort could not have come about without the political and economic weight of the eu behind it on this day we must also pay_tribute to the federal_republic of germany and its chancellor helmut kohl for assuming responsibility and accepting the enormous costs on_behalf of the inhabitants of the federal_republic when east germany was included practically overnight in a united germany not everything was settled yet however with the fall of communism an old problem returned the balkans tito's authoritarian rule had kept a lid on the many ethnic conflicts when that lid was lifted violent conflicts blazed up again the like of which we had thought we would never see again in a free europe five wars were in fact fought in the space of a few years we will never forget srebrenica where 8,000 muslims were massacred in a single day now however the eu is seeking to lay the foundations for peace also in the balkans slovenia joined the eu in 2004 croatia will become a member in 2013 montenegro has opened membership negotiations and serbia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia have been given candidate status the balkans were and are a complicated region unresolved conflicts remain suffice it to mention that the status of kosovo is still not finally settled bosnia hercegovina is a state that hardly functions owing to the veto the three population groups have become entitled to exercise against each_other the paramount solution is to extend the process of integration that has applied in the rest of europe borders become less absolute which population group one belongs to no_longer determines one's security the eu must accordingly play a main part here too to bring_about not only an armistice but real peace for several decades turkey and the eu have been discussing their relations to each_other after the new government headed by the akp party won a clear parliamentary majority the aim of eu membership has provided a guideline for the process of reform in turkey there can be no_doubt that this has contributed to strengthening the development of democracy there this benefits europe but success in this respect is also important to developments in the middle_east the norwegian_nobel committee has time and again presented the peace_prize to champions of human_rights now the prize is going to an organization of which one cannot become a member without first having adapted all one's legislation to the universal_declaration of human_rights and the european convention on human_rights but human_rights as such are not enough we can see this now that country after country is undergoing serious social unrest because misplaced policies corruption and tax evasion have led to money being poured into gaping black holes this leads understandably to protests demonstrations are part of democracy the task of politics is to transform the protests into concrete political action the way out of the difficulties is not to dismantle the european institutions we need to maintain solidarity across borders as the union is doing by cancelling debts and adopting other concrete support measures and by formulating the framework for a finance industry on which we all depend unfaithful servants must be removed these are preconditions for the continuing belief of the european masses in the compromises and moderation which the union is now demanding of them your_majesties your_royal highnesses heads of government and heads of state ladies and gentlemen honourable presidents of the european union jean monnet said that nothing can be achieved without people but nothing becomes permanent without institutions we are not gathered here_today in the belief that the eu is perfect we are gathered in the belief that here in europe we must solve our problems together for that purpose we need institutions that can enter into the necessary compromises we need institutions to ensure that both nation states and individuals exercise self control and moderation in a world of so many dangers compromise self control and moderation are the principal needs of the 21st century 80 million people had to pay the price for the exercise of extremism together we must ensure that we do not lose what we have built on the ruins of the two world wars what this continent has achieved is truly fantastic from being a continent of war to becoming a continent of peace in this process the european union has figured most prominently it therefore deserves the nobel peace_prize the frescos on the walls here in the oslo city hall are inspired by ambrogio lorenzetti's frescos from the 1300s in the siena town hall named allegory of the effects of good government the fresco shows a living medieval town with the gates in the wall invitingly wide open to spirited people bringing the harvest in from fruitful fields but lorenzetti painted another picture allegory of the effects of bad government it shows siena in chaos closed and ravaged by the plague destroyed by a struggle for power and war the two pictures are meant to remind us that it is up to ourselves whether or not we are to live in well ordered circumstances may good government win in europe we are bound to live together on this continent living together vivre ensemble zusammenleben convivencia birlikte yasamak git'vemeste leve sammen congratulations to europe in the end we decided to live together may other continents follow thank_you for your attention your_majesties your_royal highness representatives of the laureate excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the entry_into force of the chemical_weapons convention in 1997 prohibiting the development production storage and use of chemical_weapons states that the parties to the convention are determined for the sake of all mankind to exclude completely the possibility of the use of chemical_weapons is that not beautiful still more beautiful it can be achieved we are in fact close to the target this is to a large degree due to the work of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical_weapons opcw which was created to ensure the implementation of the convention the nobel peace_prize for 2013 therefore goes most deservedly to an organisation and its personnel who have been quietly working to remove an entire category of weapons our congratulations and with this_year's prize we prompt those states that have not acceded to the convention to do so the use of chemicals in warfare is nearly as old as mankind for thousands of years spears and arrows have had poison applied to them to enhance their effect homer's iliad and odyssey tell us that such poisoned arrows were used by the parties to the trojan war chinese sun tzu mentions the use of fire with various weapons in hinduism the law of manu favours a ban on poison and fire arrows recommending the poisoning of food and water instead up through the centuries there are masses of examples of the use of various chemical_weapons in due course there followed demands for bans on such weapons the hague convention from the peace congress of 1899 and the convention from the congress of 1907 recommended the prohibition of poison and poison weapons in the waging of war but it was so little use world war one marked the first massive use of chemical_weapons in war by the end of the war a total of 124,000 tonnes of gas had been produced 85,000 are reckoned to have lost their lives owing to chemical_weapons while almost 1.2 million were injured in the wake of world war i international efforts to ban the use of chemical_weapons and prevent such suffering from being inflicted again on soldiers and civilians intensified the result of this renewed global commitment was the 1925 geneva_protocol for the prohibition of the use of asphyxiating poisonous or other gases and bacteriological methods of warfare but it did not have much effect because it did not forbid the production and storage of such weapons as long as possession of such weapons was permitted there was a strong temptation to use them hitler used chemical means to take the lives of millions of people during world war two but surprised many by not making direct use of chemical_weapons when waging the war itself in berlin they were probably afraid of what the allied response might be if the germans were the first to use such weapons their own forces might also suffer from their use on the battlefield since world war two chemical_weapons have been used frequently the former regime in iraq made extensive use of chemical_weapons both in the war on iran in the 1980s and on its own kurdish population terrorists have also used such weapons the geneva_protocol of 1925 had in other words not had the required effect a more comprehensive agreement was clearly needed the new chemical_weapons convention was drawn_up in 1992 93 it prohibits the use production and storage of such weapons the convention entered_into force in 1997 the opcw was established to see that the convention was implemented the opcw's objective then is not arms_control as so often in such connections the objective is disarmament in the form of elimination of chemical_weapons in effect a huge step in human history because never before has a weapon previously integrated in the armed_forces and doctrines of states been banned and its removal sought from the earth's surface the convention which entered_into force in 1997 has rendered chemical_weapons taboo under international_law the convention imposes many and detailed obligations all countries that ratify the agreement undertake to submit a full survey of whatever they may possess of chemical_weapons and equipment for the production of such weapons they furthermore undertake to destroy whatever they possess of such weapons and production facilities and to admit international inspectors to ensure that such destruction has taken_place the destruction must be carried_out in cooperation with the opcw the opcw has the right to inspect any production facility in a signatory state at 76 hours notice 190 countries are currently members of the opcw the members represent 98 per_cent of the world's population and territory as well as 98 per_cent of the world's total chemical industry 80 per_cent of the chemical_weapons have been removed 90 per_cent of the production capacity has been destroyed we are accordingly quite close to achieving the highly ambitious target of totally eliminating chemical_weapons this is the result not only of cooperation between many countries but also of cooperation undertaken between the business and industry research institutions and organisations of those countries without such cooperation the implementation of many of the provisions in the convention would not have been possible this_year's prize is therefore being awarded to a form of international cooperation of which we need more in other areas but it has not all been successes the opcw was unable to observe the deadline which was april 2012 for the destruction of declared chemical_weapons some 20 per_cent chiefly american and russian weapons have not yet been destroyed it is of course not acceptable that two leading powers themselves so eager to see others destroying their stores as quickly as possible have not yet themselves managed to do the same please speed up the process now that syria has joined the opcw only 6 states remain non members two israel and myanmar have signed but not ratified the convention please ratify it angola north_korea egypt and south sudan have neither signed nor ratified please do so it marks a big step forward that syria has joined the opcw and that plans are now being drawn_up for the destruction of all its chemical_weapons it is of course a huge challenge for the opcw to manage to destroy all these weapons under the conditions of war and chaos prevailing in the country and in much less time than is normally available the anonymous inspectors from the opcw do an extremely important and difficult job that makes the presence of many of you here_today so significant today's prize is also your prize the target of removing chemical_weapons from the surface of the earth is highly ambitious but it is not necessarily the case that it will be achieved once and for all development does_not stop we suspect the emergence of new forms of warfare new types of chemical_weapons types which the world has not seen up to now and which are potentially dreadful in their consequences discussion of possible new substances that are not currently defined in the convention will confront the opcw with new challenges we should never underestimate the policy of small steps the follow up on the chemical_weapons convention by the opcw has shown how small steps can produce large results the dominant direction of the norwegian_nobel committee's work over the years has partly been the struggle for disarmament but still more the struggle for international cooperation whether through the league of nations or the united_nations the opcw has its feet firmly planted in both traditions which also figure so prominently in alfred_nobel's will the current situation in the middle_east and the persian gulf lends an important perspective to the chemical_weapons convention and the existence of the opcw namely that such a multilateral framework once_again became a platform from which to attempt to resolve a current crisis without the use of weapons we were on the verge of a new military confrontation in the middle_east which could have unimaginable consequences that has so far been avoided the improved climate this creates may pave the way for negotiations for a solution to the whole conflict in syria we know from experience that one good step may be followed by others i hope everyone is with me in a plea to the parties lay down your arms stop the bloodbath come to the negotiating table that the leadership of the russian federation saw that the chemical_weapons convention and the opcw could be used to shift the conflict over chemical_weapons onto a new track and that president_obama responded favourably may also have contributed to creating a new climate around iran's nuclear program president rouhani went to the un general_assembly with a more favourable message than we have heard before a telephone conversation between the presidents of iran and the united_states took_place for the first time for over 30 years an important though as yet only preliminary agreement has been concluded to limit iran's nuclear program we know that a political solution in syria and a peaceful_solution to iran's nuclear_weapons program are difficult but developments are more promising than for a long time peace is a difficult issue as we see even in the debate on the nobel peace_prize many feel that the prize should always go to bold individuals with firm principles we need such role models to create hope in a complicated and for many a threatening world the prize has often gone to such outstanding individuals many of them have moved the world in the right direction but peace is not brought about by individuals and idealists alone we also need practical politicians capable of moving the world away from confrontation within often narrow limits we also need institutions not least the global ones within the united_nations it is the interplay between all of these that can create peace the nobel peace_prize has accordingly honoured all these directions this must remain the nobel_committee's platform alfred_nobel's will is a visionary document and concrete at the same_time he wrote that the prize should go to whoever had done most for fraternity_between nations the reduction of standing_armies and the holding of peace congresses the agreement of 2010 between presidents obama and medvedev concerning strategic nuclear_arms was important because the alternative was a new nuclear_arms race so it fitted in with a modern understanding of alfred_nobel's demand for the reduction of standing_armies the chemical_weapons convention and the work of the opcw meet all of alfred_nobel's requirements they concern disarmament are a form of modern peace congress and strengthen fraternity_between nations what is more while negotiations concerning nuclear_arms have been based_on the exclusive right claimed by the nuclear powers to have nuclear_arms the chemical_weapons convention contains no such right it is a real disarmament agreement all countries must eliminate their chemical_weapons all nations are treated equally this must be the perspective also where nuclear_arms are concerned as was resolved by the un security_council meeting called by president_obama in 2009 nuclear_weapons too must vanish from the face of the earth many people ask not least in syria itself whether it really makes any difference whether one is killed by chemical_weapons or by conventional means for those_who are hit the answer is no though no one should underestimate the suffering that chemical_weapons impose on their victims on the road to a more peaceful world it is nevertheless important to combat the most monstrous weapons first the weapons of mass destruction we have banned the biological weapons the norwegian_nobel committee has awarded many prizes to the struggle_against nuclear_weapons today the focus is on chemical_weapons and on the progress we have made the honour for that goes to the 1997 convention and to the opcw we praise today's laureate and extend our best wishes for success in the important tasks remaining thank_you for your attention norwegianenglish the nobel foundation stockholm 2014 general

speech at the nobel peace_prize award_ceremony your_majesties your_royal highnesses excellencies_ladies and gentlemen a conscience exists in the world which extends beyond all national_boundaries and is independent of religion culture and social adherence it states that children have a right to childhood they have a right to go to school instead of being forced to work they are not to start life as the slaves of others this world conscience can find no better expression than through kailash satyarthi and malala yousafzai dear nobel prize laureates a stronger expression of alfred_nobel's appeal for fraternity_between nations would be difficult to find except through you two we are honoured to have you here congratulations the road to democracy and freedom is paved with knowledge taliban and is dislike knowledge because they know that it is an important condition for freedom attendance at school especially by girls deprives taliban is boko haram and similar movements of power but nothing should be further from islam than using suicide bombs against their co religionists or shooting at a young girl whose only demand was to be allowed to go to school violence and repression can not be justified in any religion islam christianity judaism hinduism and buddhism protect life and can not be used to take lives the two whom we honour here_today stand very firm on this point they live according to a principle mahatma_gandhi gave expression to he said there are many purposes i would have died for there are no purposes i would have killed for satyarthi and yousafzai are precisely the people whom alfred_nobel in his will calls champions of peace this they are not only behind a desk but in practice your_majesties your_royal highnesses_ladies and gentlemen kailash sathyarthi's vision is quite simply to put an end to child_labour since he abandoned a promising career as an electrical engineer in 1980 this has been sathyarthi's overriding aim he has worked at several different levels to achieve it at grass root level he has achieved the release of some 80,000 children sometimes in very dramatic circumstances he has often been brutally attacked it takes little fantasy to imagine the reaction when he and his co workers go into worn down factory premises round about in india to set the children free powerful interests have profited from child_labour they do not give up without a struggle satyarthi himself has adhered to non_violence the child labourers are not infrequently recruited by kidnapping but are often also hired out by parents who cannot manage their debts enslavement to debt remains very widespread not only in india but also in many other countries satyarthi insists that it is not poverty that leads to child_labour child_labour maintains poverty carrying it on from generation to generation school attendance releases people from poverty satyarthi has developed a model for how liberated children can be rehabilitated and provided with education they must be provided with a basic education to enable them to some extent to function as normal citizens rather_than as slaves he has set_up a number of different organizations which work both in india and internationally to fulfil children's rights bachpan bachao andolan is perhaps his most_important instrument taking direct action to set children free satyarthi's struggle is marked by great inventiveness rugmark established in 1994 now goodweave is a striking example it is an international consortium of representatives of countries which export and import rugs we can all by simple means check that a rug has not been made by child labourers a network of inspectors has been set_up to ensure that the system works the children get to go to school and the adult workers earn a fair wage exporters and importers pay a small fee to keep up this system of inspections and controls efforts are in hand to spread the scheme to other products often made by child_labour such as knitted goods and sports gear on the 17th of january 1998 satyarthi embarked on his biggest project the global march against child_labour seven million children and adults took_part in this march which entered many different countries and regions the march wound up at the ilo headquarters in geneva the following year the ilo convention against the worst forms of child_labour was unanimously adopted the convention has currently been ratified by 172 countries no ilo convention has been ratified more quickly ilo conventions 138 and 182 and the un convention on the rights of the child now form the basis of the world wide struggle_against child_labour and for education much nevertheless remains to be done there are roughly 60 million child labourers in india alone most of them in farming if the country were to ratify the two ilo conventions that would be a big step in the right direction there are currently 168 million child labourers worldwide in the year 2000 the figure was 78 million higher in this as in so many other areas things are thus moving in the right direction and often much faster than we think satyarthi indeed believes that child_labour can be more or less eliminated in his own lifetime everyone here shares that hope your_majesties your_royal highnesses_ladies and gentlemen malala yousafzai is far and away the youngest peace_prize laureate of all time her story has nevertheless become known practically all over the world when she was 11 or 12 she began under a pseudonym to write a blog for the bbc about what it was like to live in the swat valley in northwest pakistan under heavy pressure from the taliban and with only ambivalent support from the pakistani authorities the schools periodically had to close especially girls schools malala yousafzai's vision was clear right from the start girls had a self_evident right to education her courage is almost indescribable we all know what happened on the 9th of october 2012 when malala was 15 a gunman climbed into the school bus and asked for malala he fired three shots at her injuring her most severely her life was saved and she decided to continue her struggle for girls education although taliban have made no secret of their intention to try again pakistan's population numbers nearly 200 million one quarter are between 5 and 16 years old the nation's constitution guarantees all these children free and compulsory education but nearly half the 52 million do not go to school a large majority of them are girls and it is not just taliban that seeks to keep the girls away from school the authorities do so too having built schools without walls without running water and without toilets and at least as important indoctrination is sometimes more important than the skills and knowledge needed in order to cope in a modern world the teachers too often lack the minimum qualifications needed pakistani authorities have praised the award of the peace_prize to malala yousafzai the best gift they could give her would be dramatic improvements to the country's education system that would benefit the whole of pakistan few things provide a larger economic and social yield than investments in girls education this logic applies all over the world by placing the individual person at the centre of all politics one will soon see that those excluded are not a burden and a threat but an enormous unused resource here in europe too such logic would work wonders the problem here is not that children and adolescents receive no education or are obliged to work far too many find no use for their education or find no opportunities for work we need to leave this negative situation and instead give the younger generation the hope which is probably our strongest defence against extremism young people must be able to see into the future instead of being trapped by dark thoughts and dark forces ladies and gentlemen while it is in the nature of extremism to create enemies and frightening images and to divide the world into us and them the laureates show us something else a young girl and a somewhat older man one from pakistan and one from india one muslim the other hindu both symbols of what the world needs more unity fraternity_between the nations the laureates have underlined that if the prize can contribute to bringing indians and pakistanis two people so near to one another and yet so distant closer to one another this would add an extra dimension to the prize we share this hope ladies and gentlemen we need people like satyarthi and yousafzai to show that it helps to fight few if any of us have had greater courage to live according to mahatma gandhi's principle that i accept only one tyrant in the world and that is the still small voice within me we others have perhaps become too accustomed to following the voices of others pouring into our heads through the social media we often forget to listen to our own voice the one that talks to us about justice freedom and justice have never been ceremonial the world never progressed thanks to coldly calculating people it advanced thanks to the efforts of people with warm hearts your_majesties ladies and gentlemen we live in an age in which the world despite all the violence and extremism we see around us is marked by an increasing humanity the author james baldwin put it like this the people that once walked in darkness are no_longer prepared to do so this has become an irrevocable part of our common awareness persons like kailash satiarthi and malala yousafzai have brought us there they show that it helps to resist even under the most difficult conditions dear nobel prize laureates you will for all the future form part of the row of gold that forms our nobel history the row of campaigning people people who have created the global conscience of which we can all be the bearers the call for freedom and justice the most_important thing of all is to have children and young people set free thank_you for your attention your_majesties your_royal highnesses laureate excellencies_ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has decided to award the nobel peace_prize for 2015 to the tunisian national_dialogue quartet for its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in tunisia in the wake of the revolution of 2011 it gives the nobel_committee great pleasure to extend to the quartet's representatives a warm welcome to this_year's peace_prize award_ceremony hassine abassi secretary_general of the tunisian general labour union ugtt mohamed fadhel mahfoudh president of the tunisian order of lawyers onat abdessatar ben moussa president of the tunisian human_rights league ltdh and ouided bouchamaoui president of the tunisian confederation of industry trade and handicrafts utica aux quatre représentants du quartet lauréat du prix_nobel de_la paix je dis soyez les bienvenus à oslo the narrative underlying this_year's peace_prize is a dramatic one it speaks to the core of alfred_nobel's will and nobel's vision of fraternity disarmament and peace building forums not because the quartet has actively sought to promote disarmament but because its work has led to a better platform for peace and non violent resolution of conflicts this is a story about building strong institutions to ensure justice and stability and demonstrating the will to engage in dialogue and cooperation this_year's prize is truly a prize for peace awarded against a backdrop of unrest and war in the summer of 2013 tunisia was on the brink of civil war the quartet's resolute intervention helped to halt the spiralling violence and put developments on a peaceful track tunisia was spared the horrors of civil war and instead established a constitutional system of government guaranteeing fundamental rights for the entire population regardless of gender political conviction or religious belief ladies and gentlemen this is an admirable accomplishment and indeed worthy of a nobel prize the quartet receiving the peace_prize as one entity not as four organisations represents different sectors and values in tunisian society working life welfare principles of the rule of law and human_rights this diversity gave the quartet the moral authority to exercise its role as a mediator and driving_force for peaceful democratic development in tunisia the quartet has thus helped to lay the groundwork for national fraternity in the spirit of alfred_nobel the committee hopes that this will serve as an example for other countries to follow thereby fostering peace we live in turbulent times in north africa the middle_east and europe millions of people are fleeing from war oppression suffering and terror the causes of the refugee crisis are numerous and complex and there are no simple solutions but one thing is indisputable if every country had done as tunisia has done and paved the way for dialogue tolerance democracy and equal rights far fewer people would have been forced to flee tunisia has shown the world that islamist and secular political movements can negotiate with one another to reach solutions in the country's best interests if only they are willing to do so but there are also forces dark forces which for that very reason do not want tunisia to succeed which see the emergence of democracy and equal rights for all including women in an arab muslim country as a threat to their own ambitions for power and as irreconcilable with their own extremist mind set this poses major security challenges for tunisia security measures states of emergency and ideological battles alone cannot solve these challenges economic and political reforms not least a sustained effort to combat corruption are also needed let_us take a closer look at the story behind this_year's prize and see just what makes it a peace_prize in the truest sense the arab spring originated in tunisia to understand the causes of the uprising it may help to quote the then 19 year old tunisian author samar al mazghani who shortly before the revolution described the paralysing hopelessness she felt in her home country under the ben ali dictatorship here we live with no dreams or we dream with no life and our dreams are postponed until something happens to change this reality that something occurred just months later on 17 december 2010 the 26 year old fruit and vegetable seller mohamed bouazizi set himself on fire in a desperate protest_against the corruption and misrule that prevailed in his home town of sidi bouzid the tragic incident sparked long suppressed anger among the inhabitants of sidi bouzid social media communicated news of what had happened and the rage spread culminating in nation wide protests and demonstrations four weeks later president ben ali tunisia's autocratic leader for many years fled to saudi arabia the dictator had experienced the truth of the old tunisian saying the multitude is stronger than the king however events gradually took a turn that aroused concern in tunisia the government spearheaded by the islamist party ennahda tried to insert provisions into the new constitution that would have had negative consequences for the status of women in society even before the revolution tunisian women had enjoyed greater freedom than women in other arab countries now they wanted full equality not reduced rights the situation gradually got worse after two shocking political assassinations and the killing of eight tunisian soldiers by terrorists alongside large demonstrations against the government many feared that the security situation was spiralling out of control peace was truly in jeopardy it was at this critical moment that the quartet was established at the initiative of the labour union ugtt's secretary_general hassine abassi the four organisations presented a joint proposal for resolving the national crisis their plan was to convince the 21 political parties in the constituent assembly to participate in a national_dialogue under the oversight of the quartet the national_dialogue was to be an egalitarian compromise oriented process in which everyone would have a say and each party would have the same number of votes regardless of its size more specifically the quartet required the parties to sign an agreement known as the road map comprising three main points the sitting three party government was to relinquish power a non partisan technocratic government was to be appointed to govern the country until new parliamentary elections were held the constituent assembly of tunisia was to complete its work by a specified deadline and appoint an independent commission to prepare elections of a new parliament and a new president in the autumn of 2014 the government initially rejected the quartet's initiative but after lengthy and difficult negotiations the quartet succeeded slowly but surely in bringing all the parties in tunisia to the negotiation table a decisive breakthrough was achieved when first two and eventually all three government parties agreed to step down as soon as the new constitution was adopted with the road map in place the constituent assembly completed its demanding task within the stipulated time limit and in close cooperation with the quartet and the other parties to the national_dialogue process tunisia's new constitution was adopted on 26 january 2014 it is considered the most egalitarian and democratic constitution in the arab world in accordance_with the road map the troika government resigned and was replaced by a caretaker government with that the quartet had fulfilled its self defined mandate and could conclude its role as mediator the ultimate validation of the quartet's historical effort came in the autumn of 2014 when the parliamentary and presidential elections were carried_out both the technocratic government and the interim president resigned and were replaced by lawfully elected successors ladies and gentlemen tunisia's path to democracy and rule of law since the revolution of 2011 is remarkable for several reasons first cooperation across religious divisions although ennahda and the secular parties often stood on opposing sides during the work on the new constitution they were compelled by the national_dialogue process to negotiate and reach compromises in the best interests of tunisian society as a whole not just their own supporters this gave the main religious parties part ownership of the emerging democracy and the new constitution they were helping to shape those_who claim that islam and democracy are incompatible or that islamic and secular parties cannot work together for the good of society need only look to tunisia second the key role played by women women took the lead in the protests against political violence and against the attempts to introduce highly oppressive gender provisions in the new constitution without women's participation the fruits of the revolution could easily have been lost women must have the same opportunities as men to influence developments at every level of society if genuine democracy and lasting peace are to be achieved if there is anyone who still doubts that this goal is attainable in muslim and arab countries let him or her look to tunisia third peaceful transitions of power since the revolution in 2011 tunisia has witnessed several shifts of government and presidents tunisian politicians and parties deserve credit for their willingness to accept the will of the people and the rules of democracy even when this made it necessary for them to resign or step down in favour of their opponents last but not least the crucial importance of civil society when the constitutional process foundered and the government institutions and parties failed to resolve the political crisis civil society organisations and representatives stepped in to assume national responsibility there was no stronger symbol of this commitment than the national_dialogue quartet but it did not stand alone other organisations also contributed each in its own way we can truly say therefore that the peace democracy and constitutional state we now see are the work of the tunisian people dear quartet the norwegian_nobel committee is aware that tunisia faces major challenges and that a great_deal of work remains to be done we hope that the peace_prize will help to ensure that there is no return to the tunisia that existed before democracy before the revolution and we hope moreover that the laws and institutions that the national_dialogue process has helped create will be a foundation for lasting stability and progress or as the british irish politician edmund burke once advised another people after another historic revolution make the revolution a parent of settlement and not a nursery of future revolutions tunisia's security challenges are urgent they are all too familiar to us they resemble our own they are our own in this time of terror the threats against tunisia and the tunisian people are indistinguishable from the threats against other countries they are the same forces that broke the peace this autumn with acts of terrorism in so many places including beirut ankara in the airspace over the sinai peninsula and in paris bamako and tunis and that recently murdered a norwegian a chinese and a russian hostage in syria because the threat is essentially the same to us all we must stand together to combat it for that very reason this is the time to mobilise support for tunisia and help to ensure that the democratisation process is continued and safeguarded among a great many other_things that means providing support for economic development and cooperation the international community must assume its responsibility and invest in tunisia ladies and gentlemen one of the most_important results of the national_dialogue process is without a doubt the constitution of 26 january 2014 as i said earlier it is the most democratic constitution in the entire arab world members of the national_dialogue quartet it is easy for us norwegians to appreciate the importance of this achievement in the same year that you helped steer the constitutional process to a successful conclusion the norwegian people celebrated the 200th anniversary of their constitution it was one of the most radical and democratic constitutions of its time and we are still proud of it it is the hope of the norwegian_nobel committee that 200 years from now the people of tunisia will look_back on the founding fathers and mothers of their constitution including the national_dialogue quartet with the same sense of pride in closing i would like to share with you that the boy you see on this_year's nobel diploma is intended by the artist to symbolise the uncertain future faced by young people today especially all those_who feel that they have no power or opportunity to influence it this is a forceful eloquent image the expression on the young boy's face reflects a cry for hope for the future for the opportunity to be seen and heard take part in society use his skills and live in peace and security we hope that this diploma will inspire the quartet and all positive forces in tunisia to continue their shared search for peaceful forward looking solutions around the negotiation table for the good of the nation and may the diploma remind us all of our obligation to the millions of children and young people who while we are gathered here_today feel as if they are groping in the dark with no hope or faith in the future may these young people have the blindfold removed from their eyes and see a brighter future a future in peace and freedom inspired by this vision i would like to conclude with the words of an earlier peace_prize laureate martin_luther king jr darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that norwegianenglishspanish berit reiss andersen deputy chair of the norwegian_nobel committee delivering the presentation speech at the nobel peace_prize award_ceremony your_majesties your_royal highnesses mr_president your_excellencies distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has decided to award the nobel peace_prize for 2016 to colombia's president juan manuel santos for his resolute and courageous efforts to bring to an end the country's more_than 50 year long civil war the award has been made to president santos alone but it is also intended as a tribute to the colombian people a people who despite great hardships and countless injustices have never given up hope of a just peace many groups and individuals have contributed to the peace process and deserve our thanks and tribute today including tireless negotiators facilitators diplomats politicians and of course leaders from the government and the farc guerrillas our tribute is paid not least to the representatives of the civil war's victims several of whom are present here_today they carry their own painful stories yet manage to represent other victims as well we salute all these strong fearless individuals and offer them our respectful gratitude the armed conflict between the colombian authorities the farc and eln revolutionary guerrilla groups and various paramilitary groups is the longest civil war in our time the human and material cost of the conflict is almost inconceivable and very difficult to measure numbers give only a vague albeit horrifying impression of the extent of the suffering and the war's impact on daily life for several generations of colombians since the first military confrontations in may 1964 and until the mutual ceasefire entered_into force this summer more_than 222 000 colombians have lost their lives as a direct consequence of the conflict four of every five persons killed were civilian non combatants in addition somewhere between five and seven million colombians were forced to flee their homes many have lived ever_since as displaced_persons in their own_country in 2013 an investigative report was presented by the colombian national center for historical memory the report shows that nearly 2 000 massacres of civilians have taken_place in colombia since the early 1980s allegedly more_than 1 000 of these mass killings were carried_out by paramilitary groups who fought the rebels almost 350 by farc or eln guerrillas and close to 300 by colombian security forces the rebel guerrillas for their part were responsible for a majority of the many kidnappings that terrorised the colombian people from 1995 to 2005 in that decade an average of one kidnapping took_place every eight hours the guerrillas used the kidnappings and the ever expanding drug trade to finance their warfare colombia has long been the world's biggest producer of cocaine the social and health effects of drug trafficking is a tragedy in its own right with consequences far_beyond colombia's borders now at last it looks as though this terrible conflict will soon be history mr_president you initiated the negotiations that culminated in the peace accord between the colombian government and the farc guerrillas earlier this autumn this was an initiative that required considerable political courage and great perseverance the initiative was grounded in a conviction that negotiations were the only path to creating a better future for your people after a narrow majority of voters opposed the accord in the referendum held on 2 october you made it clear that you would in no way give up but would pursue your efforts to end the civil war with undiminished vigour like many others you realised that the colombian people had not voted no to peace but to the accord submitted to them in this critical situation you issued an invitation to participate in a broad based national_dialogue with a view to reaching an agreement that could also win the support of its critics the accord has now been renegotiated while the second agreement has also been subject to criticism several contentious points in the first accord have been amended and the groundwork has been laid for a historic national compromise you have been a driving_force throughout this peace process mr_president when the referendum results were announced many observers felt that it would be premature to award you the nobel peace_prize this year they recommended that the norwegian_nobel committee wait another year to see whether the peace process would eventually succeed in bringing about true peace the committee however saw things differently in our view there was no time to lose on the contrary the peace process was in danger of collapsing and needed all the international support it could get moreover we were deeply convinced that you mr_president as colombia's head of state were the one to continue to move the peace process forward developments in the weeks since the announcement of this_year's peace_prize have in no way weakened our conviction in this respect in awarding the nobel peace_prize for 2016 to president juan manuel santos the norwegian_nobel committee sought to encourage him and all those working to achieve peace reconciliation and justice in colombia not to give up political compromises seldom strike a perfect balance peace accords are especially hard to balance nonetheless it is our sincere hope that the renegotiated accord that has now been signed by the parties and ratified by the congress is a solution that can ensure the colombian people peace and positive development mr_president after the referendum you emphasised that you would continue to work for peace until your very last day in office because that's the way to leave a better country to our children children under the age of 15 account for 23 per_cent of colombia's population or more_than 11 million people kindling a spark of hope in the eyes of these 11 million children and their loved ones is the best possible investment towards a peaceful future for your people ladies and gentlemen the history of the nobel peace_prize shows that there are many roads to peace by awarding this_year's peace_prize to president juan manuel santos the norwegian_nobel committee_wishes to honour him and all those_who have helped stake out what can be called the colombian road to peace this road has three distinctive features that can serve to inspire similar processes in other countries one is the will to face up to unpleasant painful facts in order to lay the foundation for national reconciliation for too long victims memories of abuses killings and other crimes were either a taboo or a source of continuing conflict and enmity between the parties the population's growing desire for peace could never have been satisfied without breaking this vicious cycle two important steps in the right direction were taken with the establishment of colombia's national center of historical memory and the publication in 2013 of the centre's investigative report basta ya enough already which documented in detail the magnitude of the civil war's atrocities when you mr_president was presented with the report you stated that it represented a first window towards the truth that we owe to the victims of this country the second distinctive feature of the colombian road to peace is the participation of the victims and their representatives the negotiations between the government and the farc were ground breaking because they gave the victims representatives the opportunity to testify about their dreadful experiences in the presence of the parties concerned and to confront perpetrators on all sides of the conflict inspired in part by south africa's peace and reconciliation process the parties have recognised that a lasting peace arrangement must safeguard the rights and dignity of the victims while ensuring that the truth becomes known and that the perpetrators are held accountable and admit their guilt in this connection i wish to commend farc guerrilla leader rodrigo londoño for so clearly and unreservedly expressing regret for the suffering that the farc has inflicted on the civilian population and asking the colombian people for forgiveness this is an example to be followed the third distinctive feature of this peace process is the fact that the parties have engaged critics of the process by inviting them to join in a broad based national_dialogue this was particularly the case after the referendum when president santos reached out to those_who had voted no simultaneously the leader of the farc gave assurance that the organisation would continue negotiating and use only words as weapons to build towards the future i venture to believe that this means the national reconciliation process is already well underway there is still however a long way to go after more_than 50 years of bitter conflict true reconciliation does_not happen overnight overcoming deep seated distrust and a sense of exclusion is a huge task we therefore encourage all sides in colombia to carry on the national_dialogue and continue on the road to reconciliation ladies and gentlemen alfred_nobel's will refers to three different types of peace work that qualify for the nobel peace_prize contributions to fraternity_between nations to the abolition_or reduction of standing_armies or to the holding and promotion of peace congresses all these forms of peace work are represented in this_year's peace_prize the peace process has already helped to foster fraternity_between different parts of the population in colombia the civil war has also been a source of tension between colombia and other countries in the region ending the civil war once and for all could strengthen fraternity not only in colombia but also across national borders in the americas this_year's peace_prize also pertains greatly to the abolition_or reduction of standing_armies meaning disarmament and arms_control around 7 000 farc soldiers are to be disarmed the surrender and destruction of the weapons will be overseen by the united_nations hopefully a similar negotiated disarmament agreement with the eln guerrilla will soon be in place as well even_though the obtained disarmament so far applies primarily to the farc guerrillas it is the committee's hope that the peace accord will also enable the government to reduce its military expenditure and thereby release funds that can be spent on building peace and welfare in colombia and lastly the long and intense talks that the colombian government has held with the farc guerrillas and the victims representatives assisted by international facilitators such as cuba and norway have in many ways served as a continual national peace congress the award of the peace_prize to president santos thus absolutely fulfils the criteria and the spirit of alfred_nobel's will the more_than 50 year armed conflict in colombia is complex and the country faces a magnitude of problems that must be solved this will take time making it even more important to get to work quickly only when peace has been restored will it be possible to give priority to education and other important services to assure positive sustainable development it is the norwegian_nobel committee's hope that in the years to come the colombian people will be able to reap the benefits of the ongoing peace and reconciliation process so that the country can effectively address major challenges such as poverty social injustice and drug related crime mr_president by awarding you this_year's peace_prize the norwegian_nobel committee wished to commend you on the results already achieved in the peace process but it also sought to strengthen you and those around you in the difficult situation that arose after the referendum it is with relief and satisfaction that we now note that your stated ambition of travelling to oslo with a new peace accord in hand has been fulfilled perhaps the nobel peace_prize has contributed positively by giving you and the peace process a little push forward in these critical weeks it is the committee's hope that it will also serve as an inspiration to all colombians as they now begin implementing the accord and building a just and lasting peace ladies and gentlemen seeking forgiveness for atrocities and suffering on the scale we have seen in colombia is asking a great_deal no one can demand that a victim forgive his or her assailant but by opening up memories by having victims and perpetrators alike tell their stories a foundation is also laid for reconciliation this is what philosophers have called the work of memory it is a painful process yet at the same_time it is a process that makes it possible to leave the pain behind and join forces in building a better future this_year's peace_prize diploma which is reproduced in the programme in front of you addresses this very issue the motif may look like a kiss the artist willibald storn has said but for me this picture is about forgiveness in closing i would like to quote another nobel peace_prize laureate archbishop desmond_tutu whose words bear direct relevance to the current situation in colombia forgiving and being reconciled to our enemies or our loved ones are not about pretending that things are other than they are true reconciliation exposes the awfulness the abuse the hurt the truth it is a risky undertaking but in the end it is worthwhile because in the end only an honest confrontation with reality can bring real healing norwegianenglish the nobel foundation stockholm

presentation speech at the nobel peace_prize award_ceremony your_majesties your_royal highnesses distinguished representatives of the nobel peace_prize laureate your_excellencies distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen the international campaign to abolish nuclear_weapons ican has been awarded the nobel peace_prize for 2017 on_behalf of the norwegian_nobel committee i take great pleasure in congratulating ican on this award ican is receiving the award for its work to draw_attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear_weapons and for its ground breaking efforts to achieve a treaty based prohibition of such weapons ican's efforts have given new momentum to the process of abolishing nuclear_weapons this_year's peace_prize follows in a tradition of awards that have honoured efforts against the proliferation of nuclear_weapons and for nuclear disarmament twelve peace prizes have been awarded in whole or in part for this type of peace work the first went to philip_noel baker in 1959 and the most recent was awarded to barack obama in 2009 and now this year to the international campaign to abolish nuclear_weapons ican on two days in august 1945 the world experienced the terrible destructive force of nuclear_weapons for the first time the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki instantly killed at least 140,000 people the vast majority of whom were civilians hiroshima was utterly destroyed and large sections of nagasaki were laid in ruins but death was not finished with hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 the death toll continued to rise significantly in the years that followed and survivors are still suffering from the effects of radiation today the devastation of hiroshima and nagasaki has taught_us that nuclear_weapons are so dangerous and inflict so much agony and death on civilian_populations that they must never ever be used again today's nuclear_weapons are tremendously more destructive than the bombs that were dropped on japan in 1945 a nuclear war could kill millions of people dramatically alter the climate and the environment for much of the planet and destabilise societies in a way never before seen by humanity the notion of a limited nuclear war is an illusion nuclear_weapons do not distinguish between military and civilian targets used in war they would impact disproportionately on the civilian population inflicting vast unnecessary suffering it is virtually impossible for civilians to protect themselves against the catastrophic effects of a nuclear attack the use of nuclear_weapons or even the threat of using them is therefore unacceptable on any grounds whether humanitarian moral or legal despite all this it remains the case that the global balance of military power is maintained by nuclear_weapons the logic of this balance of terror rests on the proposition that nuclear_weapons are such a deterrent that no one would dare attack a nuclear armed state the deterrent effect is said to be so strong that it alone has prevented war between the nuclear powers for the last 70 years the empirical basis for this assumption is highly debatable it cannot be claimed with any certainty that deterrence has worked as intended it is also worth keeping in mind that nuclear deterrence requires a credible threat to actually use nuclear_weapons the weapons exist so that they can if necessary be deployed a number of international agreements and treaties have been entered_into which limit the possession and development of nuclear_weapons the most_important of these is the treaty on the non_proliferation of nuclear_weapons or npt it takes considerable military and political insight to fully understand all the treaties agreements and international legal instruments that regulate disarmament and arms_control the views that dominate the political debate are those of the great_powers and powerful alliances ican arose as a protest_against the established order nuclear_weapon issues are not solely a question to be addressed by governments nor a matter for experts or high level politicians nuclear_weapons concern everyone and everyone is entitled to an opinion ican has succeeded in generating fresh engagement among ordinary people in the campaign against nuclear_weapons the organisation's acronym is perhaps not a coincidence i can ican's main message is that the world can never be safe as long as we have nuclear_weapons this message resonates with millions of people who perceive that the threat of nuclear war is greater than it has been for a long time not least due to the situation in north_korea another major concern of ican is that the current international legal order is inadequate to deal with the nuclear_weapons problem the entry_into force of the non_proliferation treaty in 1970 was a historic breakthrough it gave formal status to the nuclear powers of the day the united_states the soviet_union the uk france and china as states with the legal right to possess nuclear_weapons all other countries that acceded to the treaty pledged in so doing not to acquire such weapons in return the legally recognized nuclear_weapon states undertook to begin negotiations in good faith to seek nuclear disarmament this dual pledge is the very core of the non_proliferation treaty and both_sides of it must be honoured to maintain the treaty's legitimacy ladies and gentlemen it is no exaggeration to say that the nuclear_weapon states have only to a limited degree honoured the disarmament commitment they made in the npt let_me remind you that in 2000 the npt's review conference stated that the treaty calls for an unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear_weapon states to accomplish the total elimination of their arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament from an international_law perspective the five legally recognized nuclear_weapon states and their allies have thus assumed a responsibility to help achieve disarmament and a world free of nuclear_weapons if the disarmament process had been carried_out as intended ican's struggle for a treaty based ban on nuclear_weapons would have been unneeded it is the lack of progress towards nuclear disarmament that has made it necessary to supplement the non_proliferation treaty with other international legal initiatives and commitments the non_proliferation treaty applies only to the countries that have acceded to it india pakistan and israel which all have nuclear_weapons are not npt members moreover north_korea which has carried_out six nuclear test explosions has withdrawn from the treaty global nuclear disarmament cannot take place without these countries too participating yet they reserve for themselves the same right to nuclear_weapons as the five states that had acquired such weapons prior to 1970 the five legally recognized nuclear_weapon states for their part cite the nuclear arsenals of these other countries as one of several arguments for not yet being able to comply with the npt's nuclear disarmament requirements it is in part to break this vicious cycle that ican has advocated a universal treaty based ban on nuclear_weapons ican does_not accept that the lack of progress towards nuclear disarmament is a realpolitik necessity ican's premise is humanitarian maintaining that any use of nuclear_weapons will cause unacceptable human suffering binding international prohibitions have already been established for chemical_weapons biological weapons land mines and cluster weapons precisely because of the unacceptable harm and suffering that these weapons inflict on civilian_populations it defies common sense that nuclear_weapons which are far more dangerous are not subject to a comparable ban under international_law pointing out this legal gap was a crucial first step on the road to a prohibition treaty another important step was the humanitarian pledge initiated by the austrian government in december 2014 the pledge is a voluntary national commitment to seek to stigmatise prohibit and eliminate nuclear_weapons ican has worked resolutely to muster broad international support for the humanitarian pledge to date 127 states have signed on to this commitment ican has also been a driving_force in efforts to secure a binding international ban of nuclear_weapons on 7 july 2017 a final draft treaty was endorsed by 129 un member states the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear_weapons was opened for signature this autumn and has been signed so far by 56 states when 50 or more states have also ratified the treaty it will become binding under international_law for the signatory states ican is a young organisation founded in 2007 on the initiative of the international_physicians for the prevention of nuclear war which won the nobel peace_prize in 1985 ican is a loose coalition of 468 ngos from more_than 100 countries it is impressive that ican is able to unite so many different groups in support of a common goal and give a voice to millions of people who are convinced that nuclear_weapons do not provide security but insecurity in awarding this_year's peace_prize to ican the norwegian_nobel committee seeks to honour this remarkable endeavour to serve the interests of mankind the nobel_committee believes that an international ban on nuclear_weapons will be an important possibly decisive step on the road to a world without nuclear_weapons such a goal is fully consistent with the essence of alfred_nobel's will ladies and gentlemen ican's support for a global ban on nuclear_weapons is not uncontroversial we must acknowledge that the treaty has powerful opponents but the idea of prohibiting and abolishing nuclear_weapons is neither naïve nor new as early as 1946 in the un general assembly's very first resolution the united_nations called for nuclear disarmament and an international nuclear_weapons control regime at the reykjavik summit in 1986 mikhail_gorbachev and ronald reagan tried to halt the spiralling nuclear_arms race between the two superpowers and came close to concluding an agreement to abolish all long range nuclear missiles a year and a half earlier president reagan had addressed the people of the united_states and the soviet_union directly saying a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought the only value in our two nations possessing nuclear_weapons is to make sure they never will be used but then would it not be better to do away with them entirely today it is more important than ever to support this vision while the global community may trust that no responsible head of state would ever order another nuclear attack we have no guarantees that it will not happen despite international legal commitments irresponsible leaders can come to power in any nuclear armed state and become embroiled in serious military conflicts that veer out of control ultimately nuclear_weapons are controlled by human_beings in spite of advanced security mechanisms and control systems technical and human errors can occur with potentially catastrophic consequences can we be sure that the control systems of the nuclear powers will not someday be sabotaged by hackers acting on_behalf of hostile states terrorists or extremists in short nuclear_weapons are so dangerous that the only responsible course of action is to work for their removal and destruction many people think that the vision of a nuclear_weapon free world a global zero is utopic or even irresponsible similar arguments were once used to oppose the treaties banning biological and chemical_weapons cluster weapons and land mines nonetheless the prohibitions became reality and most of these weapons are far less prevalent today as a result using them is taboo ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee is aware that nuclear_weapons disarmament presents far greater challenges than disarmament of the types of weapons i just mentioned but there is no getting around the fact that the nuclear_weapon states have committed through the non_proliferation treaty to work towards disarmament this is the ultimate objective of the treaty through its efforts ican has reminded the nuclear_weapon states that their commitment entails a genuine obligation and the time to honour it is now in his nobel lecture in 1959 philip_noel baker took issue with the widely held opinion that complete nuclear disarmament is impossible to achieve in the real world he quoted another peace_prize laureate fridtjof_nansen the difficult is what takes a little while the impossible is what takes a little longer the people of ican are impatient and visionary but they are not naïve ican recognizes that the nuclear armed states cannot eliminate their nuclear_weapons overnight this must be achieved through a mutual gradual and verifiable disarmament process but it is the hope of ican and the norwegian_nobel committee that an international legal ban and broad popular engagement will put pressure on all nuclear armed states and expedite the process ladies and gentlemen there are two persons on the podium today who each in their way are outstanding representatives of the ican movement madam setsuko thurlow you were 13 years old when you experienced the bombing of hiroshima you have devoted your life to bearing witness to the events of 6 august 1945 you see it as your mission to describe the suffering fear and death inflicted on your city no one was spared little children their parents brothers and sisters schoolmates and grandparents were killed you say that war cannot be waged in this way and that it must never happen again you do not allow us to forget beatrice fihn you are the executive director of ican and have the challenging task of uniting different organisations and interest groups in pursuit of a common goal you are a splendid representative of the multitude of idealists who forgo an ordinary career and instead devote all of their time and skills to the work of achieving a peaceful world it is an honour to have you here as our guests and we wish to express our deep and heartfelt gratitude for the work that you do our tribute also goes to all the individuals and organisations that you represent the decision to award the nobel peace_prize for 2017 to the international campaign to abolish nuclear_weapons has a solid grounding in alfred_nobel's will the will specifies three different criteria for awarding the peace_prize the promotion of fraternity_between nations the advancement of disarmament and arms_control and the holding and promotion of peace congresses ican works vigorously to achieve nuclear disarmament ican and a majority of un member states have contributed to fraternity_between nations by supporting the humanitarian pledge and through its inspiring and innovative support for the un negotiations on a nuclear_weapon ban treaty ican has played an important role in bringing about what in our day and age is equivalent to an international peace congress in closing i would like to quote his holiness pope francis who recently declared weapons of mass destruction particularly nuclear_weapons create nothing but a false sense of security they cannot constitute the basis for peaceful coexistence between members of the human family which must rather be inspired by an ethics of solidarity the norwegian_nobel committee shares this view moreover it is our firm conviction that ican more_than anyone_else has in the past year given the efforts to achieve a world without nuclear_weapons a new direction and new vigour thank_you norwegianenglishfrencharabic pdf your_majesties your_royal highnesses nobel peace_prize laureate your_excellencies distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has decided to award the nobel peace_prize for 2018 to denis_mukwege and nadia_murad for their efforts to end the use of sexual_violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict their common struggle may be summed up in three simple statements rape and other forms of sexual_violence are unacceptable weapons in any and all warfare systematic rape as part of a military strategy in war or conflict is a war crime those responsible for war crimes must be punished and the impunity they have enjoyed must end this is the message shared by both peace_prize laureates the fight for justice unites them despite their very different backgrounds denis_mukwege is a mature man and a congolese nadia_murad is a young woman and yazidi nonetheless they are related to one another just as they are related to every person who is a victim of abuse they bring to mind the words of an earlier peace_prize laureate tawakkol karman of yemen whose prize also recognised the struggle for women's rights from this podium she said injustice against one person is injustice against all mankind she a muslim arab woman invoked the battle waged by women in male dominated societies and described it as a fight for the dignity and rights of women and men alike she dedicated her award to all those women whom history and the severity of ruling systems have made unseen to all women who made sacrifices for the sake of a healthy society with just relationships between women and men to all those women who are still stumbling on the path of freedom in countries with no social_justice or equal opportunities today's peace_prize laureates join a long tradition of champions of human_dignity carrying on the work of tawakkol karman and other peace_prize laureates to highlight the struggle and oppression of women it is the dream of ending oppression that brings us together on this occasion to honour two of the strongest voices in the world today it is so appropriate that we are able to celebrate these two laureates on the exact date of the 70th anniversary of the universal_declaration of human_rights a document that declares that all human_beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights sexual abuse is also an abuse of these fundamental rights the war waged in the democratic republic of the congo since 1997 has cost the lives of almost six_million congolese physician denis_mukwege saw among his patients a growing number of women with severe injuries caused by rape and gross violence soldiers from all sides of the conflict have attacked young women they have attacked old women and they have attacked children the point is to injure them and degrade them but also to destabilise and demoralise the community in which they live gross sexual_violence hurts the victim hurts her family and hurts her entire village and the larger community a woman who has been raped by a group of 30 soldiers cannot simply put the experience behind her and continue her life as before as a doctor denis_mukwege saw these women and the fact that they lacked health care and social support he founded panzi hospital to meet the needs of the thousands of women victimised by these war crimes today he is one of the world's foremost surgeons specialising in the repair of physical injuries caused by brutal devastating rapes however panzi hospital also provides trauma treatment and programmes to reintegrate women into society as a result of the sexual assaults many of the women have lost their families and the support of their local communities without the efforts of denis_mukwege and his staff at panzi hospital these women would have been alone to fend for themselves denis_mukwege has helped these women as a physician but he has also been a fervent advocate of their cause and their human_dignity his mission has been to tell the world of this abuse to demand acknowledgement of the victims suffering and to insist the perpetrators be held accountable denis_mukwege has made enemies by unconditionally taking the victim's side he and his staff have endured threats attempts on their lives and smear campaigns in 2012 one of his bodyguards was killed in an attack targeting dr mukwege and his family for some people defending the cause of women is clearly an intolerable offence denis_mukwege we thank_you for seeing the suffering and devoting your life to the battle for women and against sexual_violence nadia_murad grew_up in the yazidi village of kocho she had a good life with her large family dreaming like many girls of an education but also of make up and clothes all her dreams were shattered however when war came to kocho in 2014 isis launched a campaign to gain control of northern iraq and exterminate the yazidi minority nadia murad's mother and six of her brothers were brutally killed young women and girls were spared but another brutal fate awaited them they were taken prisoner by isis and transported to the city of mosul to be used as sex slaves each woman was a piece of property an object that could be bought at the slave market then used discarded sold or given away as a gift the women were supposed to be circulated among many men they were supposed to be treated brutally and humiliated with the aim of breaking them down completely the ultimate goal was the extermination of the yazidi people as isis saw it the men had to be killed and the women so damaged that they became social outcasts the most effective way of destroying a community is apparently to destroy the women it is beyond comprehension that the extermination of an ethnic group and the commission of atrocities against individuals can be rationalised by a religious belief nadia_murad is a victim of war crimes and has experienced brutality and abuse of the most horrific kind in her autobiography she has described her shock pain fear and sense of debasement at times she wanted to give up but she preserved an innate ability to resist and was never cowed managing to escape as she did was in itself a great feat but today she is receiving the nobel peace_prize for her activities subsequent to her time in isis captivity she has defied the social codes of shame and silence and dared to speak up on the abuses perpetrated against herself and thousands of yazidi women and children in doing so she has broken a stigma that has afflicted millions of women victims of wartime sexual_violence she has dedicated her life to bearing witness to war crimes and making sure that the world does_not forget nadia_murad we thank_you for your extraordinary courage ladies and gentlemen both denis_mukwege and nadia_murad have made significant contributions to combating this type of war crime by focusing attention on the suffering inflicted on women in iraq the democratic republic of the congo and everywhere else in the world where sexual_violence is used as a weapon we must be aware of these crimes if we are to combat them the war waged on women through the use of sexual_violence has been a hidden war when the time has come for peace negotiations and transitional justice these crimes have rarely been on the agenda the un special representative of the secretary_general on sexual_violence in conflict ms zainab hawa bangura so accurately stated sexual_violence in conflict needs to be treated as the war crime that it is it can no_longer be written off or treated as an unfortunate collateral damage of war ladies and gentlemen our understanding of the particularly vulnerable position of women in war has evolved it is an old problem but the will to establish legal protections for women is relatively new the rome statute of 1998 is the legal basis for the international criminal court and defines acts such as rape and sexual slavery as war crimes when these acts are committed as part of a systematic attack on the civilian population the same principles were applied by the tribunals that dealt with war crimes in rwanda and the former yugoslavia ictr and icty these tribunals also handed down judgments against persons who initiated systematic rape as part of a widespread attack against civilians the united_nations security_council followed up by adopting resolution 1325 on women peace and security in 2000 security_council resolution 1820 from 2008 goes a step further establishing that sexual_violence against women in war and conflict is a threat to international peace and security it is important that international bodies set such legal and political standards but it is our common duty to live up to them denis_mukwege is spot on when he says justice is everyone's business denis_mukwege and nadia_murad have both made significant efforts to advance this process both have been able to communicate the scale of the atrocities and to demand prosecution of all those responsible they have thereby fulfilled key criteria in alfred_nobel's will their work is in fact a contribution to disarmament sexual_violence is an intolerable weapon that cannot be accepted in warfare their primary contribution however is to what alfred_nobel called the fraternity of nations they have shown us that human suffering in war is universal they have pointed_out that women are predominantly invisible victims of the horrors of war both laureates have demanded that injustice be combated with justice war crimes must be punished and the responsibility rests with the entire international community both of them are thus fully deserving of alfred_nobel's peace_prize ladies and gentlemen this award obligates denis_mukwege and nadia_murad to continue their vital work but the award also obligates us to stand side by side with them in the struggle to end wartime sexual_violence only then can the hopeful message of nadia's autobiography the last girl come true together we must make her generation of young women and girls the last generation to suffer from the barbarism of sexual war crimes your_majesties your_royal highnesses distinguished representatives of the nobel peace_prize laureate your_excellencies distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen the norwegian_nobel committee has awarded the nobel peace_prize for 2019 to ethiopian prime_minister abiy ahmed prime_minister abiy the award bestowed upon you today rests on three major achievements first your crucial role in creating peace between eritrea and ethiopia second your efforts to build democracy in ethiopia by strengthening civil liberties and developing institutions and third but not least the award is given to you for your contribution to peace and reconciliation processes in east and north east africa for almost three decades there has been serious discord between eritrea and ethiopia at times even full war between the two countries the hostilities have involved land disputes military clashes along your common borders and a permanent breach in diplomatic and political relations since 2002 it has developed into what has become known as a no peace no war situation prime_minister abiy you have been called the man of the moment since during your first days in office as prime_minister you recognized the impetus which the transitional moment gave you and swiftly addressed the deadlocked situation you seized the initiative and were the main architect behind the peace negotiations that were successfully conducted with eritrea however without the positive response from president isaias afwerki the conclusion of the two peace treaties would not have been possible this has brought several significant changes the two nations of eritrea and ethiopia have in fact declared peace that in itself is a major step forward the peoples of the two countries are increasingly able to travel and reunite border disputes have been settled and demarcation lines have been drawn_up in accordance_with the arbitration ruling of an international boundary commission back in 2002 political and diplomatic relations have been restored however much work remains to fully implement all the intentions of the peace agreements several important border crossings remain closed and the peoples of eritrea and ethiopia therefore have limited access to one another the peace agreements also incorporate ambitions of social cultural and economic development at present this work seems to be at a stand still it is the hope of the norwegian_nobel committee that your previous achievements coupled with the added encouragement of the peace_prize will spur the parties to further implementation of the peace treaties dr abiy ahmed you were appointed prime_minister in a country facing a multitude of challenges regional and ethnic divides have resulted in approximately three million internally displaced_persons these people are homeless within their own_country and desperately need to return to their communities you are also confronted with the daunting tasks of stimulating economic development battling unemployment and improving education health care and infrastructure all of these tasks are critical building blocks in the process of constructing peace the concept of peace must incorporate social_justice and material improvement that will benefit all people during your first 100 days as prime_minister you took several firm initiatives to promote peace and democratic reform in your country a strong statement was made when you appointed women to 50 per_cent of the ministerial posts in your cabinet as a woman myself i would say that this is a wise move an equally wise move was the appointment of the world's second minister of peace another woman naturally mrs muferihat kamil who is present here_today even the president of ethiopia is now a woman in addition to which you have appointed a female supreme court chief justice mr prime_minister lifting the existing state of emergency was a matter of urgency for you you granted amnesty to thousands of political prisoners thereby acknowledging that opposition is part of a healthy political environment knowing that free speech is a cornerstone of democracy you abolished public censorship and thereby enabled the development of a free and independent press you have strengthened civil society by taking a strong stance against corruption and bribery in the public sector you have declared a commitment to hold free and democratic elections which are prerequisites for a true democracy the norwegian_nobel committee stands behind you and supports your efforts for a democratic peaceful society in recognizing your work by awarding you the nobel peace_prize we were not expressing an opinion on how or if you should lead the ethiopian people in the future the leadership of ethiopia and its political platform must be decided by the ethiopian people and the ethiopian people alone our award is based_on the will of alfred_nobel and we recognize your endeavours as being in the true spirit of that will you have chosen a path that we believe will consolidate peace and prosperity in your country dr abiy ahmed we are aware that in the course of your life you have walked several different paths you were born into a traditional family of simple means to a mother who was an amhara orthodox christian and a father who was an oromo muslim diversity seems to be part of your origin as an adult you have had a long military career including participation in a united_nations peacekeeping operation in rwanda before permanently entering ethiopian politics you held the rank of lieutenant colonel on top of that you have been able to complete your phd at the institute of peace and security studies at the university of addis ababa permit_me to also add a personal trait to your list of merits your profound humility you rarely speak publicly of your achievements and success the complexity of your background has made you well suited for the third task encompassed in our acknowledgement of your achievements today namely your work for peace and reconciliation in the east africa region you have put yourself at the disposal of your neighbours in the region to mediate disputes and conflicts in sudan you have mediated between the military regime and the civil opposition to find a transitional solution in the aftermath of omar al bashir's leadership your efforts have been much appreciated by the parties involved and have resulted in the signing of a draft constitutional declaration which aims at ensuring a smooth transition to civil rule you have also been engaged in peace and reconciliation talks in south sudan and have been willing to address the very real need of both sudan and south sudan to find and revitalize peaceful solutions to the great troubles that have afflicted their countries additionally you have sought to mediate between kenya and somalia in their protracted conflict over rights to a disputed marine area there is now hope for a resolution to this conflict finally you have made crucial contributions to normalizing the diplomatic and political relationship_between djibouti and eritrea you have demonstrated an understanding that peace among neighbours is essential in a troubled region you have made common cause with all the stakeholders from eritrea djibouti sudan south sudan and kenya who have participated in promoting mediation and peaceful resolution you represent a new generation of african leaders who realize that armed conflict and ethnic hostilities must be resolved by peaceful_means this_year's peace_prize is a recognition of all the efforts made by all the nations and individuals involved they say that good news rarely arrives from the horn of africa historically good news did in fact come from africa ethiopia is the cradle of humankind the first homo sapiens emigrated from the territory of your country in this sense we are all ethiopians your country has a unique history also within an african context since it was never colonialized by any western power it is in part for this very reason that ethiopia is home to the african union the good news of today is your endeavours to establish a new order of peace initiatives openness and peaceful mediation to find new solutions to old disputes the norwegian_nobel committee fully understands that peace is created in cooperation with others we are awarding the peace_prize to you as an individual because you have personally made an extraordinary difference across several arenas it is the totality of your efforts that convinced us that it is you mr prime_minister who have made the most significant contribution to peace in the past year in phrasing my statement this way i_am in fact quoting the terms of the will of alfred_nobel you have also fulfilled another requirement of his will namely to strengthen fraternity both between peoples and between nations the first african to receive the nobel peace_prize albert luthuli eloquently expressed the vision of the peace_prize in his acceptance speech here in oslo on 10 december 1961 speaking as a minister of the church shortly before the christmas holidays he said may the day come soon when the people of the world will rouse themselves and together effectively stamp out any threat to peace in whatever quarter of the world it may be found when that day comes there shall be peace on earth and goodwill amongst men as was announced by the angels albert luthuli's vision probably exceeded even alfred_nobel's imagination but we can use it as an ideal and inspiration to create more justice more fraternity and more peace if we are to achieve that goal we must get to work that is exactly the job you have taken upon yourself mr prime_minister thank_you
